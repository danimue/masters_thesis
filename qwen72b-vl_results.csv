To deduce the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: 8x8 grid.
   - Output: 4x4 grid.
   - The output grid seems to be a condensed version of the input grid. Each cell in the output grid appears to be derived from a 2x2 block in the input grid.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: 8x8 grid.
   - Output: 4x4 grid.
   - Similar to Example 1, the output grid is a condensed version of the input grid. Each cell in the output grid is derived from a 2x2 block in the input grid.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: 8x8 grid.
   - Output: 4x4 grid.
   - The same pattern is observed. Each cell in the output grid is derived from a 2x2 block in the input grid.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: 8x8 grid.
   - Output: 4x4 grid.
   - The same pattern is observed. Each cell in the output grid is derived from a 2x2 block in the input grid.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: 8x8 grid.
   - Output: 4x4 grid.
   - The same pattern is observed. Each cell in the output grid is derived from a 2x2 block in the input grid.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The output grid is a 4x4 grid.
- Each cell in the output grid is derived from a 2x2 block in the input grid.
- The value in each cell of the output grid is the maximum value from the corresponding 2x2 block in the input grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

Test Case Input:
```
[
[0, 4, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5],
[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[6, 0, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0],
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9],
[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]]
```

Applying the transformation rule:

1. First 2x2 block: `[[0, 4], [0, 4]]` -> max value is 4.
2. Second 2x2 block: `[[0, 4], [4, 4]]` -> max value is 4.
3. Third 2x2 block: `[[5, 0], [5, 0]]` -> max value is 5.
4. Fourth 2x2 block: `[[0, 0], [5, 5]]` -> max value is 5.
5. Fifth 2x2 block: `[[4, 4], [0, 0]]` -> max value is 4.
6. Sixth 2x2 block: `[[4, 0], [0, 0]]` -> max value is 4.
7. Seventh 2x2 block: `[[0, 5], [5, 0]]` -> max value is 5.
8. Eighth 2x2 block: `[[5, 5], [0, 0]]` -> max value is 5.
9. Ninth 2x2 block: `[[6, 0], [0, 0]]` -> max value is 6.
10. Tenth 2x2 block: `[[6, 6], [0, 6]]` -> max value is 6.
11. Eleventh 2x2 block: `[[9, 9], [0, 9]]` -> max value is 9.
12. Twelfth 2x2 block: `[[9, 0], [0, 0]]` -> max value is 9.
13. Thirteenth 2x2 block: `[[0, 6], [6, 0]]` -> max value is 6.
14. Fourteenth 2x2 block: `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]` -> max value is 0.
15. Fifteenth 2x2 block: `[[9, 0], [0, 9]]` -> max value is 9.
16. Sixteenth 2x2 block: `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]` -> max value is 0.

Output:
```
[
[4, 4, 5, 5],
[4, 4, 5, 5],
[6, 6, 9, 9],
[6, 0, 9, 0]]
```

Answer: ``` 
[
[4, 4, 5, 5],
[4, 4, 5, 5],
[6, 6, 9, 9],
[6, 0, 9, 0]]

To deduce the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input has a '1' at position (2,2) and a '5' at position (3,2). In the output, the '1' at (2,2) is removed, and a '1' appears at position (4,2) in the row of '5's. This suggests that the '1' is being moved to the row of '5's.

2. In Example 2, the input has '1's at positions (2,1) and (2,3), and '5's at positions (3,1) and (3,3). In the output, the '1's are moved to the row of '5's, appearing at positions (4,1) and (4,3).

3. In Example 3, the input has '1's at positions (2,1) and (2,4), and '5's at positions (3,1) and (3,4). In the output, the '1's are moved to the row of '5's, appearing at positions (4,1) and (4,4).

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Any '1' in the grid is moved to the row of '5's, maintaining its column position.

Applying this rule to the test case:

The test case has '1's at positions (2,2) and (2,4), and '5's at positions (3,2) and (3,4). According to the rule, the '1's should be moved to the row of '5's, resulting in '1's at positions (4,2) and (4,4).
