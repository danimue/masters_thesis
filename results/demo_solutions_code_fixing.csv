834ec97d,1,"Let's carefully analyze the transformation rules based on the provided examples.

### Observations:
1. **Example 1**: 
   - Input and Output are the same.
   - This suggests that if there are no non-zero elements other than the center, the grid remains unchanged.

2. **Example 2**:
   - A single non-zero element (6) is present in the middle of the grid.
   - The entire top part of the grid (above the 6) is filled with 4s, and the 6 remains in its place.
   - This indicates that non-zero elements (except the center) cause the cells above them to be filled with 4s.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Multiple non-zero elements are present in the grid.
   - The top part of the grid (above the first non-zero element encountered) is filled with 4s.
   - The non-zero elements themselves are preserved, and the cells above the first non-zero element are filled with 4s.
   - The rest of the grid below the first non-zero element remains unchanged.

### Transformation Rule:
- If there are no non-zero elements other than the center, the grid remains unchanged.
- For each non-zero element encountered in the grid, fill all the cells above it with 4s.
- Preserve the non-zero elements in their original positions.

### Implementation:
We need to iterate through the grid and check each cell. If a non-zero element is found, fill all cells above it with 4s. We need to be careful not to overwrite any non-zero elements.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    result = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            result[r][c] = grid[r][c]
    
    # Iterate through the grid to find non-zero elements
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] != 0:
                # Fill all cells above this non-zero element with 4s
                for i in range(r):
                    result[i][c] = 4
    
    return result
```

This implementation ensures that all cells above any non-zero element are filled with 4s while preserving the non-zero elements in their original positions.","def transform_grid(grid):

   - Here, the top five rows are filled with a checkerboard pattern of 4s and 0s, and the 9 remains in its original position. The rest of the rows are filled with 0s.

From these examples, we can deduce the following transformation rule:
- If a non-zero element is found, it remains in its position.
- All rows above the row containing the first non-zero element (excluding the row with the non-zero element itself) are filled with a checkerboard pattern of 4s and 0s.
- All rows below the row containing the last non-zero element are filled with 0s.

Let's implement this transformation rule in the `transform_grid` function:

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    result = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    # Find the first and last rows with non-zero elements
    first_non_zero_row = -1
    last_non_zero_row = -1
    
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] != 0:
                first_non_zero_row = r
                break
        if first_non_zero_row != -1:
            break
    
    for r in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] != 0:
                last_non_zero_row = r
                break
        if last_non_zero_row != -1:
            break
    
    # Fill the result grid based on the transformation rule
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if r < first_non_zero_row:
                # Checkerboard pattern for rows above the first non-zero row
                result[r][c] = 4 if (r + c) % 2 == 0 else 0
            elif first_non_zero_row <= r <= last_non_zero_row:

### Transformation Rule Summary
- If there are no non-zero elements, the grid remains unchanged.
- If there is a non-zero element, the rows above it are filled with a checkerboard pattern of `4` and `0` starting from the first row.
- The non-zero element remains in its original position.
- Rows below the non-zero element are filled with `0`.

   - **Observation:** The non-zero elements `4` and `9` remain in their positions, and the rows above them are filled with `4` in a checkerboard pattern.

### Summary of the Transformation Rule
- Non-zero elements remain in their original positions.
- Rows above any non-zero element are filled with `4` in a checkerboard pattern (alternating `4` and `0`).

### Correct Implementation
Based on the above observations, let's implement the correct transformation rule:

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    result = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    # Find the first row with a non-zero element
    first_non_zero_row = rows
    
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] != 0:
                # Copy the non-zero element to the result
                result[r][c] = grid[r][c]
                # Update the first non-zero row
                first_non_zero_row = min(first_non_zero_row, r)
    
    # Fill the rows above the first non-zero row with a checkerboard pattern of 4s
    for r in range(first_non_zero_row):
        for c in range(cols):
            result[r][c] = 4 if c % 2 == 0 else 0
    
    return result
```
This code should correctly transform the grid according to the observed rules.","def transform_grid(grid):

   - Analysis: The non-zero values are not moved, but the rows above the first non-zero value encountered are filled with 4s in a checkerboard pattern.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rules:
- If a non-zero value is found, the rows above it are filled with 4s in a checkerboard pattern.
- The non-zero values themselves remain unchanged.
- The checkerboard pattern starts from the first row and alternates between 4 and 0.

Let's implement this in the `transform_grid` function:

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    result = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    # Find the first non-zero row index
    first_non_zero_row = -1
    for r in range(rows):
        if any(grid[r][c] != 0 for c in range(cols)):
            first_non_zero_row = r
            break
    
    if first_non_zero_row == -1:
        return grid  # No non-zero values, return the original grid
    
    # Fill the rows above the first non-zero row with a checkerboard pattern of 4s
    for r in range(first_non_zero_row):
        for c in range(cols):
            result[r][c] = 4 if c % 2 == 0 else 0
    
    # Copy the rest of the grid as it is

        for c in range(cols):

834ec97d,1,"<reasoning>
Upon re-examining the transformation rule, it appears that the rows above the first non-zero element should be filled with `4` in a checkerboard pattern, but only up to the row just before the first row containing any non-zero element. The rows containing non-zero elements should remain unchanged. The previous implementation filled all rows above the first non-zero row with `4` in a checkerboard pattern, which caused issues in Example 3 where the rows below the first non-zero row should remain unchanged.

Let's correct the reasoning:
1. Identify the first row that contains any non-zero element.
2. Fill all rows above this row with a checkerboard pattern of `4`s.
3. Copy the non-zero elements to their respective positions in the result grid.
4. Rows containing non-zero elements and rows below them should remain unchanged.

Based on this corrected reasoning, here is the updated implementation:

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    result = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    # Find the first row with a non-zero element
    first_non_zero_row = rows

   - **Observation:** The non-zero elements `4` and `9` remain in their positions, and the rows above them are filled with `4` in a checkerboard pattern.

### Key Observations:
- Non-zero elements remain in their original positions.
- Rows above any non-zero element are filled with `4` in a checkerboard pattern (alternating `4` and `0`).
- The checkerboard pattern should start from the first column and alternate `4` and `0` for each column.

### Correct Implementation
Based on the above observations, let's implement the correct transformation rule:

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    result = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    # Find the first row with a non-zero element
    first_non_zero_row = rows
    
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] != 0:
                # Copy the non-zero element to the result
                result[r][c] = grid[r][c]
                # Update the first non-zero row
                first_non_zero_row = min(first_non_zero_row, r)
    
    # Fill the rows above the first non-zero row with a checkerboard pattern of 4s
    for r in range(first_non_zero_row):
        for c in range(cols):
            result[r][c] = 4 if c % 2 == 0 else 0
    
    return result
```

### Re-evaluation of the Code:
The issue in the previous code was that it was filling the rows above the first non-zero row with a checkerboard pattern, but it was not correctly handling the case where there are multiple rows with non-zero elements. Specifically, the rows above the first non-zero row should be filled with `4` in a checkerboard pattern, and the rows below the first non-zero row should remain unchanged until the next non-zero element is encountered.

Let's correct the code to handle this properly:

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    result = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    # Iterate through the grid to find non-zero elements and fill the rows above them
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] != 0:
                # Copy the non-zero element to the result
                result[r][c] = grid[r][c]
                # Fill the rows above this non-zero element with a checkerboard pattern of 4s
                for i in range(r):
                    for j in range(cols):
                        result[i][j] = 4 if j % 2 == 0 else 0
    
    return result
```

    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0

    # Find the first row with a non-zero element
    first_non_zero_row = rows

1. **Example 1**: The input and output grids are identical. This suggests that if there are no non-zero elements that need to be transformed, the grid remains unchanged.
2. **Example 2**: The non-zero element `6` remains in its position, and all the cells above it in the same column are filled with `4`. The cells in the rows above the `6` are filled in a checkerboard pattern starting from `4` in the first column.
3. **Example 3**: The non-zero elements `4` and `9` remain in their positions. The cells above these non-zero elements are filled with `4` in a checkerboard pattern. Once a non-zero element is encountered, the cells below it remain unchanged.

From these examples, we can deduce the following transformation rule:
- For each column, find the first non-zero element.
- Replace all cells above this non-zero element with `4` in a checkerboard pattern starting from `4` in the first row.
- Leave all cells below and including the first non-zero element unchanged.

Let's implement this rule in code:

```python

Based on these examples, we can deduce the transformation rule:
- If a non-zero element is found, it is replaced by `4` in the same position.
- The rows above the first non-zero element are filled with `4` in a checkerboard pattern.
- The rest of the rows below the first non-zero element (if any) are filled with `0`.

   - **Observation:** All cells above the non-zero values (4 and 9) are filled with 4s in a checkerboard pattern.

### Key Observations:
- The transformation affects only the cells above the first non-zero value encountered in each column.
- The transformation pattern is a checkerboard pattern of 4s and 0s, starting with 4 at the top.

### Correct Implementation:
Based on the above observations, we can implement the transformation rule as follows:

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    
    for c in range(cols):
        encountered_non_zero = False

            if encountered_non_zero:

                    grid[r][c] = 4
                else:
                    grid[r][c] = 0
    
    return grid
```

This code iterates through each column, and once it encounters a non-zero value, it starts filling the cells above it with a checkerboard pattern of 4s and 0s.","def transform_grid(grid):

834ec97d,4,"After carefully analyzing the examples provided, let's deduce the transformation rule:

1. **Example 1**: The grid remains unchanged because there are no non-zero values that need to be transformed.
2. **Example 2**: The top three rows are filled with a pattern of `4`s and `0`s, and the rest of the grid remains unchanged. The pattern starts from the first non-zero value encountered and propagates upwards and to the sides.
3. **Example 3**: Similar to Example 2, the top five rows are filled with the pattern, and the rest of the grid remains unchanged. The pattern stops at the first non-zero value encountered in the middle of the grid.

From these observations, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- Identify the first non-zero value in the grid.
- Starting from this value, fill the rows above it (including the row with the non-zero value) with a pattern of `4`s and `0`s.
- The pattern is such that every even-indexed column (0-based) is `4`, and every odd-indexed column is `0`.
- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

    grid[first_non_zero_row][first_non_zero_col] = grid[first_non_zero_row][first_non_zero_col]

834ec97d,5,"Let's carefully analyze the transformation rules based on the examples provided:

1. **Example 1**: The grid remains unchanged. This suggests that if the grid contains no non-zero elements or only one non-zero element at the center, it remains unchanged.

2. **Example 2**: The non-zero element (6) remains in its position, and the cells above it are filled with 4's, alternating with 0's in between. This indicates that any non-zero element in the grid will be shifted down by one row, and the cells above it will be filled with a pattern of 4's and 0's.

3. **Example 3**: Similar to Example 2, the non-zero element (9) is shifted down by one row, and the cells above it are filled with the same pattern. Additionally, the cells to the left and right of the pattern are filled with 4's.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rules:
- If a non-zero element is found, it is shifted down by one row.
- The cells above the shifted element are filled with a pattern of 4's and 0's.
- The cells to the left and right of the pattern are filled with 4's.

Let's implement this logic in the `transform_grid` function:

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    
    # Create a new grid filled with zeros
    new_grid = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] != 0:
                # If the element is not in the last row, shift it down
                if r + 1 < rows:
                    new_grid[r + 1][c] = grid[r][c]
                
                # Fill the cells above the shifted element with the pattern
                for above_r in range(r):
                    for above_c in range(cols):

                            new_grid[above_r][above_c] = 0

Upon reviewing the outputs generated by the code, it is clear that the transformation rule is not being applied correctly. Specifically, the checkerboard pattern is not being applied correctly, and the cells above the first non-zero element are not being filled properly.

Let's re-examine the transformation rule based on the examples:
1. **Example 1**: The input and output grids are identical. This suggests that if there are no non-zero elements that need to be transformed, the grid remains unchanged.
2. **Example 2**: The non-zero element `6` remains in its position, and all the cells above it in the same column are filled with `4`. The cells in the rows above the `6` are filled in a checkerboard pattern starting from `4` in the first column.
3. **Example 3**: The non-zero elements `4` and `9` remain in their positions. The cells above these non-zero elements are filled with `4` in a checkerboard pattern. Once a non-zero element is encountered, the cells below and including the first non-zero element remain unchanged.

The key points are:
- For each column, find the first non-zero element.
- Replace all cells above this non-zero element with `4` in a checkerboard pattern starting from `4` in the first row.
- Leave all cells below and including the first non-zero element unchanged.

The checkerboard pattern should alternate between `4` and `0` starting from `4` in the first row.

The previous code incorrectly filled the entire row with `4` or `0` instead of applying the checkerboard pattern correctly.

Let's re-examine the transformation rule based on the examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input and output grids are identical. This suggests that if there are no non-zero elements that need to be transformed, the grid remains unchanged.
2. **Example 2**: The non-zero element `6` remains in its position, and all the cells above it in the same column are filled with `4` in a checkerboard pattern starting from `4` in the first column. The cells in the rows above the `6` are filled in a checkerboard pattern where the cells in even-indexed columns (0-based) are `4` and the cells in odd-indexed columns are `0`.
3. **Example 3**: The non-zero elements `4` and `9` remain in their positions. The cells above these non-zero elements are filled with `4` in a checkerboard pattern. Once a non-zero element is encountered, the cells below and including the first non-zero element remain unchanged.

The key points are:
- For each column, find the first non-zero element.
- Replace all cells above this non-zero element with `4` in a checkerboard pattern starting from `4` in the first row.
- Leave all cells below and including the first non-zero element unchanged.

The previous implementation had a mistake in the nested loop where it was incorrectly filling the entire row with the checkerboard pattern based on the column index instead of filling only the cells above the first non-zero element in a checkerboard manner.
</reasoning>

Let's correct the code:

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    
    for c in range(cols):
        for r in range(rows):
            if grid[r][c] != 0:
                # Fill the cells above the first non-zero element in the column with a checkerboard pattern
                for above_r in range(r):
                    for above_c in range(cols):
                        if above_c % 2 == 0:
                            grid[above_r][above_c] = 4
                        else:
                            grid[above_r][above_c] = 0
                break
    
    return grid
```

This corrected code ensures that only the cells above the first non-zero element in each column are filled with the checkerboard pattern of `4` and `0`. The cells below and including the first non-zero element remain unchanged.","def transform_grid(grid):

     - The center cell (4, 4) is transformed to 9.
     - The cells directly above and below the center cell are transformed to 0.
     - The cells directly to the left and right of the center cell are transformed to 4.
     - The rest of the cells remain 0.

### Key Observations:
- The center cell in each grid is transformed to a specific value.
- The cells directly above, below, left, and right of the center cell are transformed to 4.
- The center cell's value seems to be related to the size of the grid.

### Transformation Rule:
- For a grid of size `n x n`, the center cell is at `(n//2, n//2)`.
- The value of the center cell in the output is `n`.
- The cells directly adjacent to the center cell in the output are 4.
- All other cells remain 0.

### Implementation:

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    result = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    if rows % 2 == 1 and cols % 2 == 1:
        center_row = rows // 2
        center_col = cols // 2
        result[center_row][center_col] = rows
        if center_row > 0:
            result[center_row - 1][center_col] = 4
        if center_row < rows - 1:
            result[center_row + 1][center_col] = 4
        if center_col > 0:

        if center_col < cols - 1:

     [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4]]
     ```
   - Output:

     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
     ```
   - **Observations:**
     - The center cell (4,4) which was 0 is now 9.
     - The cells directly above and below the center (4,4) are filled with 4.
     - The cells in the first five rows and first column are filled with 4.
     - The cell (5,4) which is the center of the bottom third is now 9, and cells above and below it are 4.

### Transformation Rule Summary

From the above observations, we can deduce the following rules:
1. The center cell of each 3x3 subgrid (starting from the top-left corner) is transformed into a value that is the sum of the number of 4s in the subgrid plus 2.
2. The cells directly above and below the center cell are set to 4.
3. The top half of each 3x3 subgrid (excluding the center row) is filled with 4s in the first column and 0s in the rest of the columns in a checkerboard pattern.

### Implementation

Let's implement the above rules in the `transform_grid` function.

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    result = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    for r in range(0, rows, 3):
        for c in range(0, cols, 3):
            subgrid_size = min(3, rows - r, cols - c)
            count_4s = 0
            for i in range(subgrid_size):
                for j in range(subgrid_size):
                    if grid[r + i][c + j] == 4:
                        count_4s += 1
            
            center_r = r + subgrid_size // 2
            center_c = c + subgrid_size // 2
            
            if 0 <= center_r < rows and 0 <= center_c < cols:
                result[center_r][center_c] = count_4s + 2
            
            if center_r - 1 >= r:
                result[center_r - 1][center_c] = 4
            if center_r + 1 < rows:
                result[center_r + 1][center_c] = 4
            
            for i in range(r, center_r):
                for j in range(c, c + subgrid_size):
                    if j == c:
                        result[i][j] = 4
                    else:
                        result[i][j] = 0

  ```
- **Observation:** The center cell (4,4) is replaced with the value `9`, and the top row cells are shifted to the middle row.

### Transformation Rule
1. If the grid is of odd dimensions, the top row cells are shifted to the middle row.
2. The center cell of the middle row is replaced with the sum of the values from the top row cells that were shifted.
3. The rest of the cells in the top row are set to `0`.
4. The bottom rows remain unchanged.

### Implementation
Based on the above observations, we can write the following code:

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    result = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]

        middle_row = rows // 2
        middle_col = cols // 2

        # Shift top row to middle row and calculate sum
        for c in range(cols):
            result[middle_row][c] = grid[0][c]
            center_sum += grid[0][c]
        
        # Set center cell to the sum of the top row cells
        result[middle_row][middle_col] = center_sum
        
        # Copy the rest of the grid
        for r in range(1, rows):

834ec97d,5,"Let's carefully analyze the transformation rules based on the given examples.

### Observations:

1. **Central Cell Transformation**:
   - In Example 1, the central cell (1,1) with value `0` is transformed to `2`.
   - In Example 2, the central cell (2,2) with value `0` is transformed to `6`.
   - In Example 3, the central cell (4,4) with value `0` is transformed to `9`.
   - The central cell seems to be transformed based on the size of the grid. For a grid of size `(2n+1) x (2n+1)`, the central cell is transformed to `n+1`.

2. **Other Non-Zero Cells**:
   - Non-zero cells in the input grid are transformed to `4` in the output grid, except for the central cell which gets a special value as mentioned above.

3. **Zero Cells**:
   - Zero cells remain zero unless they are in the central position, in which case they get a special value.

4. **Pattern**:
   - For grids where the central cell is transformed, all cells above the central row are set to `4` in the output grid.
   - The central row and all rows below it remain zero except for the central column, which gets the special value in the central cell and `4` in other non-zero cells.

### Implementation:

Based on the above observations, we can implement the transformation rule as follows:

   - **Observation:**
     - The 4s are moved to the middle column of the top two rows.
     - The center cell (1,1) contains the value 2, which is the sum of the 4s divided by 2 (since there are two 4s).

     - The center cell (5,4) in the sixth row contains the value 9, which is the sum of the 4s divided by 5 (since there are five 4s in each column).

### Corrected Transformation Rule:
- The 4s in the input grid are moved to the same columns in the top rows up to the middle row.
- The center cell in the row just below the middle row contains the sum of the 4s in the input grid divided by the number of rows in the top half (including the middle row if the grid has an odd number of rows).

### Implementation:

Based on the above analysis, let's implement the corrected transformation rule:

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    result = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    sum_of_fours = [0] * cols
    num_rows_top_half = (rows // 2) + 1 if rows % 2 == 1 else rows // 2
    
    # Move 4s to the top rows and calculate the sum of 4s for each column
    for r in range(num_rows_top_half):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == 4:
                result[r][c] = 4
                sum_of_fours[c] += 4
    
    # Place the sum of 4s divided by the number of rows in the top half in the center cell of the row just below the middle row
    if rows % 2 == 1:
        middle_row = rows // 2
        for c in range(cols):
            if sum_of_fours[c] > 0:
                result[middle_row + 1][cols // 2] = sum_of_fours[c] // num_rows_top_half
    
    return result
```

     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
     ```
   - **Observation:**
     - The 4s remain in the same columns in the top five rows.
     - The center cell (5,4) in the sixth row contains the value 9, which is the sum of the 4s from the input divided by 5 (since there are five 4s).

### Correct Transformation Rule:
- The 4s in the input grid are moved to the same columns in the top rows up to the middle row.
- The center cell in the row just below the middle row contains the sum of the 4s in the input grid divided by the number of rows that contain 4s.

### Implementation:

Based on the corrected analysis, let's implement the transformation rule:

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    result = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    sum_of_fours = 0
    count_of_rows_with_fours = 0
    
    # Move 4s to the top rows and calculate the sum of 4s
    for r in range(rows):
        has_four = False
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == 4:
                if r < (rows // 2) + 1:
                    result[r][c] = 4
                sum_of_fours += grid[r][c]
                has_four = True
        if has_four:
            count_of_rows_with_fours += 1
    
    # Place the sum of 4s divided by the count of rows with 4s in the center cell of the row just below the middle row
    if rows % 2 == 1 and count_of_rows_with_fours > 0:
        middle_row = rows // 2
        result[middle_row + 1][cols // 2] = sum_of_fours // count_of_rows_with_fours
    
    return result
```

This code should correctly transform the input grids according to the observed rules.","def transform_grid(grid):

Let's carefully re-examine the transformation rules based on the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:**
     ```
     [
     [4, 0, 4],
     [4, 0, 4],
     [0, 0, 0]]
     ```
   - **Output:**
     ```
     [
     [0, 4, 0],
     [0, 2, 0],
     [0, 0, 0]]
     ```
   - **Observation:**
     - The 4s are moved to the middle column of the top two rows.
     - The center cell (1,1) contains the value 2, which is the sum of the 4s in the middle column of the input.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:**
     ```
     [
     [4, 0, 4, 0, 4],
