1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - The input grid size is consistently 13x5.
   - The output grid size is consistently 6x5.

2. **Analyze the transformation:**
   - The input grid contains a pattern of red (2) and black (0) squares.
   - The output grid contains a pattern of green (3) and black (0) squares.
   - The yellow row in the middle of the input grid (7th row) is always present and does not change in the output.

3. **Identify the pattern:**
   - The transformation seems to involve converting red (2) squares to green (3) squares, while keeping black (0) squares as black (0).
   - The yellow row (7th row) is always present in the output, indicating it is a fixed part of the transformation.

4. **Determine the transformation rule:**
   - Convert all red (2) squares to green (3) squares.
   - Keep all black (0) squares as black (0).
   - The yellow row (7th row) remains unchanged.

5. **Confirm the rule on the examples:**
   - Example 1: The red squares are converted to green, and the black squares remain black. The yellow row is unchanged.
   - Example 2: The same rule applies, with red squares becoming green and black squares remaining black. The yellow row is unchanged.
   - Example 3: The same rule applies, with red squares becoming green and black squares remaining black. The yellow row is unchanged.
   - Example 4: The same rule applies, with red squares becoming green and black squares remaining black. The yellow row is unchanged.

6. **Apply the transformation rule to the test case:**
   - Convert all red (2) squares to green (3) squares.
   - Keep all black (0) squares as black (0).
   - The yellow row (7th row) remains unchanged.

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - Example 1: Input (15x19), Output (15x19)
   - Example 2: Input (14x13), Output (14x13)
   - Example 3: Input (13x15), Output (13x15)
   - Example 4: Input (14x15), Output (14x15)
   - Test case: Input (16x15), Output (16x15)

2. **Look at both, the integer representation and the image, to determine what stays the same and what changes between input and output:**
   - The overall structure of the grid remains the same, but the positions of the black squares (0) change.
   - In each example, the black squares seem to be moved to the center of the grid, forming a vertical line in the middle of each color block.

3. **Deduce a transformation rule:**
   - For each color block in the grid, if there is a black square (0) in that block, it is moved to the center column of that block.
   - If there are multiple black squares in a block, they are all moved to the center column.
   - The center column is determined by the width of the color block. If the width is odd, the center is the middle column. If the width is even, the center is the two middle columns.

4. **Confirm the transformation rule on the examples given:**
   - Example 1: The black square in the yellow block is moved to the center column (column 5). The black square in the purple block is moved to the center column (column 10).
   - Example 2: The black square in the red block is moved to the center column (column 2). The black square in the blue block is moved to the center column (column 8).
   - Example 3: The black squares in the purple block are moved to the center column (column 4). The black square in the green block is moved to the center column (column 8).
   - Example 4: The black square in the green block is moved to the center column (column 12). The black square in the yellow block is moved to the center column (column 5).

5. **Apply the transformation rule to the test case:**
   - The black square in the purple block is moved to the center column (column 5).
   - The black square in the red block is moved to the center column (column 7).
   - The black square in the green block is moved to the center column (column 11).
   - The black square in the blue block is moved to the center column (column 2).

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - All the input and output grids are 10x10.

2. **Analyze the changes between input and output:**
   - In all examples, the red (2) and black (0) cells remain unchanged.
   - The brown (9) cells appear in the output where there are black (0) cells surrounded by red (2) cells.

3. **Deduce the transformation rule:**
   - The brown (9) cells are placed in the black (0) cells that are completely surrounded by red (2) cells.
   - A black (0) cell is considered surrounded if all its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are red (2).

4. **Confirm the rule on the examples:**
   - In Example 1, the black (0) cells in the middle of the red (2) blocks are turned into brown (9).
   - In Example 2, the same pattern is observed where black (0) cells surrounded by red (2) are turned into brown (9).
   - In Example 3, the same rule applies, and the black (0) cells surrounded by red (2) are turned into brown (9).

5. **Apply the rule to the test case:**
   - Identify the black (0) cells that are completely surrounded by red (2) cells.
   - Change these black (0) cells to brown (9).

   - The top 4 rows and the bottom 4 rows of the input grid are relevant for the output.
   - The output grid is a 4x4 grid that seems to be derived from the top and bottom 4 rows of the input grid.

3. **Deduce a transformation rule and confirm that it works on the examples given:**
   - The output grid is derived from the top 4 rows and the bottom 4 rows of the input grid.
   - The transformation rule appears to be:
     - For each cell in the output grid, if the corresponding cell in the top 4 rows of the input grid is 1 (blue) and the corresponding cell in the bottom 4 rows of the input grid is 2 (red), the output cell is 3 (green).
     - Otherwise, the output cell is 0 (black).

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - All input grids are 5x7.
   - All output grids are 3x3.

2. **Look at both, the integer representation and the image, to determine what stays the same and what changes between input and output:**
   - The output grid is a smaller version of the input grid, focusing on a specific 3x3 section.
   - The 3x3 section in the output grid appears to be centered around the middle of the input grid.
   - The values in the output grid correspond to the values in the input grid at the same relative positions.

3. **Deduce a transformation rule and confirm that it works on the examples given:**
   - The transformation rule seems to be: Extract the 3x3 section from the input grid that is centered around the middle of the input grid.
   - Let's confirm this rule with the examples:
     - Example 1: The middle 3x3 section of the input grid is:
       ```
       [0, 8, 0],
       [8, 8, 8],
       [0, 8, 0]
       ```
       This matches the output.
     - Example 2: The middle 3x3 section of the input grid is:
       ```
       [2, 2, 2],
       [0, 2, 2],
       [2, 0, 2]
       ```
       This matches the output.
     - Example 3: The middle 3x3 section of the input grid is:
       ```
       [4, 4, 0],
       [0, 4, 4],
       [4, 0, 4]
       ```
       This matches the output.
     - Example 4: The middle 3x3 section of the input grid is:
       ```
       [4, 0, 4],
       [0, 0, 0],
       [4, 4, 4]
       ```
       This matches the output.
     - Example 5: The middle 3x3 section of the input grid is:
       ```
       [0, 3, 0],
       [3, 0, 3],
       [0, 0, 3]
       ```
       This matches the output.

4. **Solve the test case:**
   - The test case input grid is:

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - Both the input and output grids are 10x10 in size.

2. **Analyze the changes between input and output:**
   - The input grids contain only black (0) and blue (1) cells.
   - The output grids contain a variety of colors (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) in addition to black (0).

3. **Identify patterns in the transformation:**
   - The blue cells (1) in the input grid seem to be replaced by a pattern of colors in the output grid.
   - The pattern appears to be a 3x3 block of colors centered on the blue cell.
   - The colors in the 3x3 block are consistently red (2), orange (7), blue (1), and pink (6).

4. **Determine the specific pattern:**
   - The 3x3 block pattern is as follows:
     ```
     [2, 7, 1]
     [7, 1, 6]
     [1, 6, 2]
     ```
   - This pattern is centered on the blue cell in the input grid.

5. **Confirm the transformation rule on the examples:**
   - Example 1: The blue cell at (2,7) in the input results in the 3x3 block centered at (2,7) in the output.
   - Example 2: The blue cell at (0,6) in the input results in the 3x3 block centered at (0,6) in the output.
   - The rule consistently applies to all blue cells in the input grids.

6. **Apply the transformation rule to the test case:**
   - The test case has blue cells at (0,1), (0,9), (2,8), (3,4), (7,8), and (7,0).
   - Apply the 3x3 block pattern centered on each blue cell.

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - Example 1: Input is 9x9, Output is 9x9.
   - Example 2: Input is 10x8, Output is 10x8.
   - Example 3: Input is 11x11, Output is 11x10.
   - The output grid size is the same as the input grid size in terms of rows, but the number of columns in the output is always 1 less than the number of columns in the input.

2. **Look at both, the integer representation and the image, to determine what stays the same and what changes between input and output:**
   - The non-zero values in the input grid are replaced by a full row of the same color in the output grid.
   - The position of the non-zero values in the input grid determines the row in the output grid that gets filled with that color.
   - The columns in the output grid are shifted to the left by one position compared to the input grid.

3. **Deduce a transformation rule and confirm that it works on the examples given:**
   - For each non-zero value in the input grid, find its row index.
   - In the output grid, fill the entire row corresponding to that index with the same color.
   - Shift all columns in the output grid to the left by one position.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

Applying the transformation rule:
- Row 0: 3 -> [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- Row 1: 2 -> [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
- Row 3: 3 -> [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- Row 5: 2 -> [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
- Row 7: 1 -> [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
- Row 9: 1 -> [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

All other rows remain as [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Finally, shift all columns to the left by one position.

1. **Grid Size Analysis:**
   - All input and output grids are of size 15x15.

2. **Observation of Changes:**
   - In all examples, the red (2) and grey (5) shapes remain in the same position in the output as they were in the input.
   - The grey (5) shapes seem to be moved or transformed in some way, but the red (2) shapes stay in the same place.

3. **Transformation Rule:**
   - The grey (5) shapes appear to be moved to the center of the grid, forming a new shape.
   - The new shape formed by the grey (5) is a rectangle that is centered in the grid.
   - The size of the rectangle seems to be determined by the number of grey (5) cells in the input.

4. **Confirming the Rule:**
   - In Example 1, the grey (5) cells form a vertical line in the input. In the output, they form a horizontal line in the center.
   - In Example 2, the grey (5) cells form a larger shape in the input. In the output, they form a larger rectangle in the center.
   - In Example 3, the grey (5) cells form a smaller shape in the input. In the output, they form a smaller rectangle in the center.

5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case:**
   - The test case has grey (5) cells forming a larger shape in the input.
   - The red (2) cells remain in the same position.
   - The grey (5) cells should form a rectangle in the center of the grid.

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - Example 1: Input is 4x4, Output is 4x4.
   - Example 2: Input is 7x7, Output is 7x7.
   - Example 3: Input is 6x6, Output is 6x6.
   - Test case: Input is 3x3, Output should be 3x3.

2. **Look at both, the integer representation and the image, to determine what stays the same and what changes between input and output:**
   - In all examples, the grid size remains the same.
   - The colors (numbers) are rearranged in a specific pattern.
   - Observing the examples, it appears that the first row of the input becomes the first column of the output, the second row becomes the second column, and so on.

3. **Deduce a transformation rule and confirm that it works on the examples given:**
   - The transformation rule seems to be: **Transpose the grid**.
   - Transposing a grid means swapping the rows and columns.
   - Let's confirm this rule with the examples:
     - Example 1: Transposing the input grid results in the output grid.
     - Example 2: Transposing the input grid results in the output grid.
     - Example 3: Transposing the input grid results in the output grid.
   - The rule holds for all examples.

4. **Solve the test case using the deduced transformation rule:**
   - Test case input: 
     [
     [7, 6, 1],
     [6, 7, 6],
     [6, 2, 2]
     ]
   - Transpose the grid:
     [
     [7, 6, 6],
     [6, 7, 2],
     [1, 6, 2]
     ]

1. **Grid Size Analysis:**
   - Example 1: Input and output are both 20x20.
   - Example 2: Input and output are both 10x10.
   - Example 3: Input and output are both 15x15.
   - Test case: Input is 13x13.
   - Conclusion: The grid size remains the same between input and output.

2. **Comparison of Input and Output:**
   - In all examples, the majority of the grid remains unchanged.
   - The changes occur in specific areas where there are green (3) and red (2) cells.
   - In Example 1, the green cells (3) are replaced by a green line that connects the green cells.
   - In Example 2, the green cells (3) are replaced by a green line that connects the green cells.
   - In Example 3, the green cells (3) are replaced by a green line that connects the green cells.

3. **Transformation Rule:**
   - The transformation rule appears to be: Replace all green cells (3) with a green line that connects all green cells.
   - The line should be as straight as possible, and if there are multiple green cells in a row or column, they should be connected by a green line.

4. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - The test case has green cells (3) at positions (8,4) and (8,5).
   - These green cells should be replaced by a green line that connects them.

5. **Applying the Transformation Rule:**
   - Replace the green cells (3) at positions (8,4) and (8,5) with a green line that connects them.

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - The input grids are all 10x10.
   - The output grids are all 2x2.

2. **Analyze the integer representation and the image:**
   - In each example, the input grid contains two distinct shapes, each with a different color.
   - The output grid is a 2x2 grid that seems to represent the dominant color of each quadrant of the input grid.

3. **Determine what stays the same and what changes:**
   - The dominant color in each quadrant of the input grid is preserved in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
   - The output grid is a simplified representation of the input grid, focusing on the dominant color in each quadrant.

4. **Deduce the transformation rule:**
   - Divide the 10x10 input grid into four 5x5 quadrants.
   - For each quadrant, determine the dominant color (the color that appears most frequently).
   - Place the dominant color of each quadrant in the corresponding cell of the 2x2 output grid.

5. **Confirm the transformation rule on the examples:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - Top-left quadrant: Dominant color is orange (7).
     - Top-right quadrant: Dominant color is orange (7).
     - Bottom-left quadrant: Dominant color is purple (8).
     - Bottom-right quadrant: Dominant color is purple (8).
     - Output: [[7, 7], [8, 8]] (matches the given output).

   - **Example 2:**
     - Top-left quadrant: Dominant color is pink (6).
     - Top-right quadrant: Dominant color is pink (6).
     - Bottom-left quadrant: Dominant color is orange (7).
     - Bottom-right quadrant: Dominant color is orange (7).
     - Output: [[6, 6], [7, 7]] (matches the given output).

   - **Example 3:**
     - Top-left quadrant: Dominant color is yellow (4).
     - Top-right quadrant: Dominant color is yellow (4).
     - Bottom-left quadrant: Dominant color is red (2).
     - Bottom-right quadrant: Dominant color is red (2).
     - Output: [[4, 4], [2, 2]] (matches the given output).

6. **Apply the transformation rule to the test case:**
   - Top-left quadrant: Dominant color is green (3).
   - Top-right quadrant: Dominant color is brown (9).
   - Bottom-left quadrant: Dominant color is green (3).
   - Bottom-right quadrant: Dominant color is brown (9).

2. **Analyze the changes between input and output:**
   - The grey color (5) remains unchanged in the output.
   - All other colors are replaced with black (0) except for some specific colors that are retained in certain positions.

3. **Identify the retained colors:**
   - In each example, the colors that are retained in the output are the ones that are located at the positions of the grey color (5) in the input grid.
   - The retained colors are the ones that are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to the grey color (5) in the input grid.

4. **Deduce the transformation rule:**
   - Replace all colors except grey (5) with black (0).
   - Retain the colors that are directly adjacent to the grey color (5) in the input grid.

5. **Confirm the rule on the examples:**
   - Example 1: The colors adjacent to grey (5) are retained, and all other colors are replaced with black (0).
   - Example 2: The same rule applies, retaining the colors adjacent to grey (5) and replacing others with black (0).
   - Example 3: The rule is consistent, retaining the colors adjacent to grey (5) and replacing others with black (0).
   - Example 4: The rule is confirmed, retaining the colors adjacent to grey (5) and replacing others with black (0).

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - All the input and output grids are of size 10x10.

2. **Analyze the changes between input and output:**
   - In Example 1, the only change is in the 6th row, where the first and last elements are both 4, and the entire row is filled with 4s.
   - In Example 2, the 2nd and 8th rows are filled with the same color as the first and last elements of those rows.
   - In Example 3, there are no changes because none of the rows have the same color at the first and last positions.

3. **Deduce the transformation rule:**
   - The rule appears to be: If the first and last elements of a row are the same and non-zero, fill the entire row with that color.
   - If the first and last elements of a row are different or zero, leave the row unchanged.

4. **Confirm the rule on the examples:**
   - Example 1: The 6th row has 4 at both ends, so it is filled with 4s. All other rows remain unchanged.
   - Example 2: The 2nd row has 8 at both ends, so it is filled with 8s. The 8th row has 1 at both ends, so it is filled with 1s. All other rows remain unchanged.
   - Example 3: No rows have the same non-zero color at both ends, so no rows are changed.

5. **Apply the rule to the test case:**
   - The 2nd row has 4 at the first position and 2 at the last position, so it remains unchanged.
   - The 4th row has 3 at both ends, so it is filled with 3s.
   - The 6th row has 2 at the first position and 9 at the last position, so it remains unchanged.
   - The 8th row has 6 at both ends, so it is filled with 6s.
   - All other rows remain unchanged.

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - Example 1: Input (7x13), Output (7x13)
   - Example 2: Input (13x7), Output (13x7)
   - Example 3: Input (7x7), Output (7x7)
   - Test case: Input (7x17), Output (7x17)

   The grid sizes remain the same between input and output.

2. **Look at both, the integer representation and the image, to determine what stays the same and what changes between input and output:**
   - In Example 1, the red (2) and green (3) squares are shifted to the right.
   - In Example 2, the red (2) and green (3) squares are shifted to the right.
   - In Example 3, the red (2) and green (3) squares are shifted to the right.

   The pattern suggests that the red and green squares are being shifted to the right.

3. **Deduce a transformation rule and confirm that it works on the examples given:**
   - The transformation rule appears to be: Shift all red (2) and green (3) squares to the right by one position, wrapping around to the leftmost column if necessary.

   Let's confirm this rule on the examples:
   - Example 1: The red and green squares are shifted to the right by one position.
   - Example 2: The red and green squares are shifted to the right by one position.
   - Example 3: The red and green squares are shifted to the right by one position.

   The rule works for all examples.

4. **Apply the transformation rule to the test case:**
   - Shift all red (2) and green (3) squares to the right by one position, wrapping around to the leftmost column if necessary.

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - The input grid size is consistently 16x16.
   - The output grid size is consistently 3x3.

2. **Analyze the transformation:**
   - The output grid appears to be a simplified version of the input grid, where each 3x3 block of the input grid is reduced to a single cell in the output grid.
   - The color of each cell in the output grid corresponds to the most frequent color in the corresponding 3x3 block of the input grid.

3. **Confirm the transformation rule:**
   - In Example 1:
     - The top-left 3x3 block of the input grid has the most frequent color as yellow (4), so the top-left cell of the output grid is yellow (4).
     - The top-middle 3x3 block has the most frequent color as orange (7), so the top-middle cell of the output grid is orange (7).
     - The top-right 3x3 block has the most frequent color as blue (1), so the top-right cell of the output grid is blue (1).
     - This pattern continues for the rest of the output grid.
   - The same pattern is observed in Examples 2 and 3.

4. **Apply the transformation rule to the test case:**
   - Divide the 16x16 input grid into 3x3 blocks.
   - Determine the most frequent color in each 3x3 block.
   - Assign the most frequent color to the corresponding cell in the 3x3 output grid.

   - The input and output grids have the same dimensions.

2. **Look at both, the integer representation and the image, to determine what stays the same and what changes between input and output:**
   - The blue squares (value 1) remain in the same positions in the output as they were in the input.
   - New purple squares (value 8) appear in the output, surrounding the blue squares in a specific pattern.

3. **Deduce a transformation rule:**
   - The purple squares (value 8) are placed in the output grid such that they form a cross shape around each blue square (value 1).
   - The cross shape extends horizontally and vertically from the blue square, filling in all the black squares (value 0) that are directly adjacent to the blue square.
   - If a blue square is adjacent to another blue square, the purple squares will connect the two blue squares, forming a continuous cross shape.

4. **Confirm the transformation rule on the examples given:**

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - All input and output grids are 10x10.

2. **Analyze the changes between input and output:**
   - The green squares (value 3) remain in the same positions in the output as they were in the input.
   - New purple squares (value 8) appear in the output grid.

3. **Determine the placement of purple squares:**
   - In Example 1, the purple squares are placed in positions that are diagonally adjacent to the green squares.
   - In Example 2, the purple squares are placed in positions that are diagonally adjacent to the green squares, but also in a pattern that seems to extend the diagonal lines formed by the green squares.
   - In Example 3, the purple squares are placed in positions that are diagonally adjacent to the green squares, forming a diagonal line.

4. **Formulate the transformation rule:**
   - The rule appears to be: For each green square, place a purple square in all diagonally adjacent positions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) if those positions are empty.

5. **Confirm the rule on the examples:**
   - Example 1: The purple squares are correctly placed diagonally adjacent to the green squares.
   - Example 2: The purple squares are correctly placed diagonally adjacent to the green squares, extending the diagonal lines.
   - Example 3: The purple squares are correctly placed diagonally adjacent to the green squares.

6. **Apply the rule to the test case:**
   - Identify the positions of the green squares.
   - Place purple squares in all diagonally adjacent positions if those positions are empty.

1. **Grid Size Analysis:**
   - Example 1: Input grid is 24x11, and the output grid is also 24x11.
   - Example 2: Input grid is 14x13, and the output grid is also 14x13.
   - Test case: Input grid is 15x15, so the output grid should also be 15x15.

2. **Observation of Changes:**
   - In both examples, the purple (8) and black (0) cells remain unchanged.
   - The green (3) and yellow (4) cells in the output seem to be placed in specific patterns.
   - In Example 1, the green and yellow cells are placed in a checkerboard pattern within the purple cells.
   - In Example 2, the yellow cells are placed in a checkerboard pattern within the purple cells.

3. **Transformation Rule:**
   - The transformation rule appears to be:
     - Keep the purple (8) and black (0) cells unchanged.
     - Place green (3) and yellow (4) cells in a checkerboard pattern within the purple cells.
     - The specific color (green or yellow) seems to be determined by the position of the cell within the purple area.

4. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case:**
   - Identify the purple (8) and black (0) cells and keep them unchanged.
   - Place green (3) and yellow (4) cells in a checkerboard pattern within the purple cells.

1. **Grid Sizes**: 
   - The input and output grids in both examples are 15x15. The test case also has a 15x15 grid.

2. **Observation of Changes**:
   - In both examples, the purple (8) background remains unchanged.
   - The blue (1) squares form a pattern that is transformed into a new pattern with pink (6) squares.
   - The pink (6) squares appear in a cross-like pattern around the blue (1) squares.

3. **Transformation Rule**:
   - The blue (1) squares form a rectangular shape.
   - The transformation rule seems to be:
     - For each blue (1) square, a cross of pink (6) squares is formed around it.
     - The cross is centered on the blue (1) square and extends one square in all four directions (up, down, left, right).

4. **Confirming the Rule**:
   - In Example 1, the blue (1) squares form a small rectangle. The output shows a cross of pink (6) squares around each blue (1) square.
   - In Example 2, the blue (1) squares form two separate rectangles. The output shows a cross of pink (6) squares around each blue (1) square in both rectangles.

5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**:
   - The test case has two separate blue (1) rectangular shapes.
   - Apply the cross pattern of pink (6) squares around each blue (1) square in both rectangles.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples step by step:

1. **Grid Size Analysis:**
   - Example 1: Input and output are both 24x24.
   - Example 2: Input and output are both 27x27.
   - Example 3: Input and output are both 27x27.
   - The test case is also 27x27.

2. **Observation of Changes:**
   - In all examples, the black (0) cells remain unchanged.
   - The colors of the non-black cells change in a specific pattern.

3. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - In Example 1, the purple (8) cells become green (3) in the output.
   - In Example 2, the green (3) cells become yellow (4) in the output.
   - In Example 3, the yellow (4) cells become red (2) in the output.
   - The pattern seems to be a cyclic shift of colors: 8 -> 3, 3 -> 4, 4 -> 2.

4. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - The test case contains the following colors: 0 (black), 4 (yellow), 3 (green), 8 (purple), and 6 (pink).
   - Applying the observed pattern:
     - Purple (8) should become green (3).
     - Green (3) should become yellow (4).
     - Yellow (4) should become red (2).
     - Pink (6) should become purple (8).

5. **Transformation Rule:**
   - The transformation rule is a cyclic shift of colors: 8 -> 3, 3 -> 4, 4 -> 2, 6 -> 8.
   - Black (0) cells remain unchanged.

6. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case:**
   - Replace all 8s with 3s.
   - Replace all 3s with 4s.
   - Replace all 4s with 2s.
   - Replace all 6s with 8s.
   - Keep all 0s as 0s.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the input and output grid sizes.
- **Example 1**: Input is 22x22, Output is 12x15.
- **Example 2**: Input is 12x12, Output is 8x8.
- **Example 3**: Input is 15x16, Output is 6x9.

### Step 2: Look at both, the integer representation and the image, to determine what stays the same and what changes between input and output.
- In all examples, the green color (3) is present in the output and seems to be a constant feature.
- The blue color (1) is also present in the output and seems to be a constant feature.
- The red color (2) is present in the output and seems to be a constant feature.
- The purple color (8) is present in the output and seems to be a constant feature.
- The other colors (yellow, grey, pink, orange, brown) are not present in the output.

### Step 3: Deduce a transformation rule and confirm that it works on the examples given.
- The green color (3) is always present in the first column of the output.
- The blue color (1) is always present in the first row of the output.
- The red color (2) is present in the output but its position seems to be determined by the input.
- The purple color (8) is present in the output but its position seems to be determined by the input.

### Transformation Rule:
1. The output grid has a fixed size of 12x15.
2. The first column of the output is always green (3).
3. The first row of the output is always blue (1).
4. The red color (2) and purple color (8) are present in the output based on their positions in the input.

### Test Case:
- The input grid is 15x15.
- The output grid should be 12x15.
- The first column of the output is always green (3).
- The first row of the output is always blue (1).
- The red color (2) and purple color (8) are present in the output based on their positions in the input.

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - The input grids are all 10x10.
   - The output grids are all 3x3.

2. **Look at both, the integer representation and the image, to determine what stays the same and what changes between input and output:**
   - The input grids contain various colors (integers) scattered across the 10x10 grid.
   - The output grids are 3x3 and seem to represent a simplified version of the input grid.
   - The colors in the output grid correspond to the most frequent color in each 3x3 block of the input grid.

3. **Deduce a transformation rule:**
   - The input grid is divided into 3x3 blocks.
   - For each 3x3 block in the input grid, the most frequent color is determined.
   - If there is a tie for the most frequent color, the color with the smallest integer value is chosen.
   - The output grid is constructed by placing the most frequent color from each 3x3 block into the corresponding cell of the 3x3 output grid.

4. **Confirm the transformation rule on the examples given:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - Top-left 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Top-middle 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Top-right 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Middle-left 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Middle-middle 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Middle-right 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Bottom-left 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Bottom-middle 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Bottom-right 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]] (This does not match the given output, so there might be an error in the example or the rule needs adjustment).

   - **Example 2:**
     - Top-left 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Top-middle 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Top-right 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Middle-left 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Middle-middle 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Middle-right 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Bottom-left 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Bottom-middle 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Bottom-right 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
     - Output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]] (This does not match the given output, so there might be an error in the example or the rule needs adjustment).

5. **Solve the test case:**
   - Top-left 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
   - Top-middle 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
   - Top-right 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
   - Middle-left 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
   - Middle-middle 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
   - Middle-right 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
   - Bottom-left 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
   - Bottom-middle 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
   - Bottom-right 3x3 block: [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0] -> Most frequent color is 0.
   - Output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]] (This does not match the given output, so there might be an error in the example or the rule needs adjustment).

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - All input and output grids are 10x10.

2. **Analyze the changes between input and output:**
   - In Example 1, the green squares (3) in the input are shifted diagonally downwards and to the right in the output.
   - In Example 2, the yellow squares (4) in the input are also shifted diagonally downwards and to the right in the output.
   - In Example 3, the orange squares (7) in the input are shifted diagonally downwards and to the right in the output.

3. **Deduce the transformation rule:**
   - The transformation rule appears to be shifting all non-zero values diagonally downwards and to the right.
   - If a non-zero value is at position (i, j) in the input, it will be at position (i+1, j+1) in the output.
   - If the shifted position is out of bounds (i.e., beyond the 10x10 grid), the value is not included in the output.

4. **Confirm the rule on the examples:**
   - Example 1: The green squares at (3,3), (3,4), (4,5) in the input are shifted to (4,4), (4,5), (5,6) in the output.
   - Example 2: The yellow squares at (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6) in the input are shifted to (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7) in the output.
   - Example 3: The orange squares at (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (5,7) in the input are shifted to (5,7), (5,8), (6,7), (6,8) in the output.

5. **Apply the rule to the test case:**
   - The purple squares (8) in the test case are at positions (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,6).
   - Shifting these positions diagonally downwards and to the right:
     - (4,5) -> (5,6)
     - (4,6) -> (5,7)
     - (5,4) -> (6,5)
     - (5,5) -> (6,6)
     - (6,3) -> (7,4)
     - (6,6) -> (7,7)

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - All input and output grids have the same size: 6x9.

2. **Analyze the changes between input and output:**
   - The yellow (4) and purple (8) colors are the only ones that change.
   - The yellow (4) color remains unchanged in all examples.
   - The purple (8) color changes its position and pattern.

3. **Determine the transformation rule for purple (8):**
   - In Example 1, the purple (8) color forms a pattern that resembles a rotated ""L"" shape.
   - In Example 2, the purple (8) color forms a pattern that resembles a rotated ""T"" shape.
   - In Example 3, the purple (8) color forms a pattern that resembles a rotated ""L"" shape again.
   - The purple (8) color seems to form a pattern that connects all the purple (8) cells in the input grid, but rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

4. **Confirm the transformation rule:**
   - In Example 1, the purple (8) cells in the input grid are at positions (0,3), (0,5), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5). The output grid shows these cells forming a rotated ""L"" shape.
   - In Example 2, the purple (8) cells in the input grid are at positions (0,3), (0,5), (0,6), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4). The output grid shows these cells forming a rotated ""T"" shape.
   - In Example 3, the purple (8) cells in the input grid are at positions (0,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3). The output grid shows these cells forming a rotated ""L"" shape.

5. **Apply the transformation rule to the test case:**
   - The purple (8) cells in the test case input grid are at positions (0,3), (0,5), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3).
   - Rotating these cells 90 degrees clockwise, the purple (8) cells in the output grid should form a rotated ""L"" shape.

1. **Grid Sizes**: 
   - Example 1: Input (10x10), Output (10x10)
   - Example 2: Input (10x10), Output (10x10)
   - Example 3: Input (20x20), Output (20x20)
   - Example 4: Input (11x11), Output (11x11)
   - Example 5: Input (15x15), Output (15x15)
   - Test Case: Input (20x20)

   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.

2. **Observations**:
   - The blue squares (1) in the input grid remain blue in the output grid.
   - The black squares (0) in the input grid remain black in the output grid.
   - The transformation rule seems to affect the blue squares (1) that are surrounded by other blue squares (1).

3. **Transformation Rule**:
   - If a blue square (1) is surrounded by other blue squares (1) on all four sides (top, bottom, left, right), it is changed to orange (7).
   - If a blue square (1) is surrounded by other blue squares (1) on three sides, it is changed to red (2).

4. **Confirming the Rule**:
   - In Example 1, the blue squares in the top-left and bottom-left sections are surrounded by other blue squares on all four sides, so they are changed to orange (7).
   - In Example 2, the blue squares in the top-left section are surrounded by other blue squares on three sides, so they are changed to red (2).
   - In Example 3, the blue squares in the top-left section are surrounded by other blue squares on all four sides, so they are changed to orange (7), and the blue squares in the bottom-right section are surrounded by other blue squares on three sides, so they are changed to red (2).
   - In Example 4, the blue squares in the top-left section are surrounded by other blue squares on all four sides, so they are changed to orange (7).
   - In Example 5, the blue squares in the top-left section are surrounded by other blue squares on all four sides, so they are changed to orange (7), and the blue squares in the bottom-right section are surrounded by other blue squares on three sides, so they are changed to red (2).

5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**:
   - The blue squares in the top-left section are surrounded by other blue squares on all four sides, so they are changed to orange (7).
   - The blue squares in the bottom-right section are surrounded by other blue squares on three sides, so they are changed to red (2).

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - Example 1: Input (18x14), Output (18x14)
   - Example 2: Input (15x14), Output (15x14)
   - Example 3: Input (14x14), Output (14x14)
   - Test case: Input (25x19), Output (25x19)

2. **Analyze the changes between input and output:**
   - In all examples, the output grid retains the same dimensions as the input grid.
   - The non-zero values in the input grid are shifted to the bottom-right corner of the grid.
   - The relative positions of the non-zero values to each other are maintained.

3. **Deduce the transformation rule:**
   - The transformation rule appears to be shifting all non-zero values to the bottom-right corner of the grid while maintaining their relative positions.
   - This can be achieved by iterating through the grid from top-left to bottom-right and moving non-zero values to the bottom-right corner.

4. **Confirm the transformation rule on the examples:**
   - Example 1: The non-zero values are shifted to the bottom-right corner, maintaining their relative positions.
   - Example 2: The non-zero values are shifted to the bottom-right corner, maintaining their relative positions.
   - Example 3: The non-zero values are shifted to the bottom-right corner, maintaining their relative positions.

5. **Apply the transformation rule to the test case:**
   - Shift all non-zero values to the bottom-right corner of the grid while maintaining their relative positions.

1. **Grid Size Analysis:**
   - All input and output grids are 13x13 in size. The test case grid is 15x15, which is larger but follows the same transformation rule.

2. **Observation of Changes:**
   - The transformation rule seems to involve adding new colored cells around the existing colored cells. Specifically, it appears that new cells are added in a way that connects the existing colored cells with the same color.

3. **Detailed Analysis of Examples:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - The blue (1) and red (2) cells remain the same.
     - New green (3) cells are added to connect the existing green cells.
     - New yellow (4) cells are added to connect the existing yellow cells.
   - **Example 2:**
     - The blue (1) and red (2) cells remain the same.
     - New green (3) cells are added to connect the existing green cells.
     - New yellow (4) cells are added to connect the existing yellow cells.
   - **Example 3:**
     - The blue (1) and red (2) cells remain the same.
     - New green (3) cells are added to connect the existing green cells.
     - New yellow (4) cells are added to connect the existing yellow cells.

4. **Transformation Rule:**
   - The rule is to add new cells of the same color to connect the existing cells of that color. This means that if there are two green cells that are not connected, new green cells will be added to form a continuous path between them.

5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case:**
   - The test case grid is 15x15, but the rule remains the same.
   - We need to add new cells to connect the existing cells of the same color.

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - Example 1: Input is 5x5, Output is 5x5.
   - Example 2: Input is 5x5, Output is 5x5.
   - Example 3: Input is 7x7, Output is 7x7.
   - Test case: Input is 7x7.

2. **Look at both, the integer representation and the image, to determine what stays the same and what changes between input and output:**
   - In all examples, the grid size remains the same.
   - The colors in the grid are the same, but their positions have changed.
   - Observing the changes, it appears that the rows of the grid have been reversed. The first row of the input becomes the last row of the output, the second row becomes the second-to-last row, and so on.

3. **Deduce a transformation rule and confirm that it works on the examples given:**
   - The transformation rule is: Reverse the order of the rows in the grid.
   - Confirming this rule on the examples:
     - Example 1: Reversing the rows of the input grid results in the output grid.
     - Example 2: Reversing the rows of the input grid results in the output grid.
     - Example 3: Reversing the rows of the input grid results in the output grid.
   - The rule works for all examples.

4. **Solve the test case using the deduced transformation rule:**

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - Both the input and output grids in the examples are 10x10.

2. **Analyze the changes between input and output:**
   - In both examples, the grey (5) cells are transformed into red (2) cells in specific patterns.
   - The transformation seems to occur in blocks of grey cells, where the inner cells of these blocks are changed to red.

3. **Break down the transformation rule:**
   - In Example 1, the top-left block of grey cells (5x5) has its inner 3x3 cells changed to red.
   - In Example 2, the top-left block of grey cells (6x6) has its inner 4x4 cells changed to red.
   - The bottom-right block of grey cells (3x3) in Example 2 has its inner 1x1 cell changed to red.

4. **Formulate the transformation rule:**
   - For any block of grey cells, the inner cells are changed to red.
   - The size of the inner block is determined by subtracting 1 from the size of the outer block in both dimensions.

5. **Confirm the rule on the examples:**
   - Example 1: The 5x5 block has a 3x3 inner block (5-2=3), which is correctly changed to red.
   - Example 2: The 6x6 block has a 4x4 inner block (6-2=4), and the 3x3 block has a 1x1 inner block (3-2=1), both correctly changed to red.

6. **Apply the rule to the test case:**
   - The test case has two blocks of grey cells: a 6x6 block at the top-left and a 7x7 block at the bottom-right.
   - The 6x6 block will have a 4x4 inner block changed to red.
   - The 7x7 block will have a 5x5 inner block changed to red.

   - Example 3: Input is 10x4, Output is 10x4.
   - Test case: Input is 10x5, Output should be 10x5.

2. **Look at both, the integer representation and the image, to determine what stays the same and what changes between input and output:**
   - The input grids are all black (0) except for the bottom-left cell which is blue (1).
   - The output grids have a pattern of alternating purple (8) and blue (1) cells.
   - The blue (1) cell in the input grid seems to determine the starting point of the pattern in the output grid.

3. **Deduce a transformation rule and confirm that it works on the examples given:**
   - The pattern in the output grid is a checkerboard of purple (8) and blue (1) cells.
   - The blue (1) cell in the input grid determines the starting point of the pattern.
   - The pattern starts with a blue (1) cell in the same position as the blue (1) cell in the input grid.
   - The pattern then alternates between purple (8) and blue (1) cells in a checkerboard fashion.

4. **Apply the transformation rule to the test case:**
   - The input grid is 10x5 with a blue (1) cell in the bottom-left corner.
   - The output grid should be a 10x5 checkerboard pattern starting with a blue (1) cell in the bottom-left corner.
   - The pattern will alternate between purple (8) and blue (1) cells in a checkerboard fashion.

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - The input and output grids are both 10x10 in size.

2. **Analyze the changes between input and output:**
   - In both examples, the input grid has a single non-zero value at a specific position.
   - The output grid has a pattern where the non-zero value from the input is used to fill certain rows and columns.

3. **Identify the pattern:**
   - In Example 1, the input has a '6' at position (2,2) and a '7' at position (7,7).
   - The output grid has:
     - The top 3 rows and the left 3 columns filled with '6'.
     - The bottom 3 rows and the right 3 columns filled with '7'.
     - The middle 4x4 area is filled with '0'.
   - In Example 2, the input has a '1' at position (2,6) and a '4' at position (7,5).
   - The output grid has:
     - The top 3 rows and the left 3 columns filled with '1'.
     - The bottom 3 rows and the right 3 columns filled with '4'.
     - The middle 4x4 area is filled with '0'.

4. **Deduce the transformation rule:**
   - The non-zero value in the input grid determines the color used in the output grid.
   - The top-left 3x3 area and the bottom-right 3x3 area are filled with the non-zero value from the input.
   - The middle 4x4 area remains '0'.

5. **Apply the transformation rule to the test case:**
   - The test case has a '2' at position (2,4) and an '8' at position (7,6).
   - The output grid should have:
     - The top 3 rows and the left 3 columns filled with '2'.
     - The bottom 3 rows and the right 3 columns filled with '8'.
     - The middle 4x4 area filled with '0'.

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - The input grid size is 13x13 in both examples.
   - The output grid size is 4x4 in both examples.

2. **Analyze the changes between input and output:**
   - The output grid is a smaller version of the input grid, specifically a 4x4 grid.
   - The output grid seems to be composed of the non-zero values from the input grid, arranged in a specific pattern.

3. **Identify the pattern:**
   - In Example 1, the non-zero values in the input grid are:
     - Purple (8) at positions (2,7) and (2,8)
     - Blue (2) at positions (4,2) and (4,3)
     - Green (3) at positions (10,4) and (11,4)
     - Blue (1) at positions (8,8) and (9,8)
   - These values are arranged in the output grid as follows:
     - Top-left: Purple (8)
     - Top-right: Blue (2)
     - Bottom-left: Green (3)
     - Bottom-right: Blue (1)
   - In Example 2, the non-zero values in the input grid are:
     - Purple (8) at positions (2,9) and (2,10)
     - Blue (1) at positions (4,3) and (4,4)
     - Yellow (4) at positions (10,5) and (11,5)
     - Red (2) at positions (7,9) and (8,9)
   - These values are arranged in the output grid as follows:
     - Top-left: Blue (1)
     - Top-right: Purple (8)
     - Bottom-left: Yellow (4)
     - Bottom-right: Red (2)

4. **Deduce the transformation rule:**
   - The output grid is a 4x4 grid composed of the non-zero values from the input grid.
   - The values are arranged in the output grid in a specific order:
     - Top-left: The first non-zero value from the top-left quadrant of the input grid.
     - Top-right: The first non-zero value from the top-right quadrant of the input grid.
     - Bottom-left: The first non-zero value from the bottom-left quadrant of the input grid.
     - Bottom-right: The first non-zero value from the bottom-right quadrant of the input grid.

5. **Apply the transformation rule to the test case:**
   - The non-zero values in the test case input grid are:
     - Pink (6) at positions (3,4) and (4,3)
     - Purple (8) at positions (3,11) and (4,12)
     - Blue (1) at positions (7,7) and (8,7)
     - Green (3) at positions (10,3) and (11,3)
   - Arrange these values in the output grid:
     - Top-left: Pink (6)
     - Top-right: Purple (8)
     - Bottom-left: Green (3)
     - Bottom-right: Blue (1)

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - Example 1: Input is 3x3, Output is 6x6.
   - Example 2: Input is 3x3, Output is 9x9.
   - Example 3: Input is 3x3, Output is 15x15.
   - The output grid size is a multiple of the input grid size. Specifically, the output grid size is the input grid size multiplied by the number of non-zero elements in the input grid.

2. **Look at both, the integer representation and the image, to determine what stays the same and what changes between input and output:**
   - The non-zero elements in the input grid are repeated in the output grid.
   - The non-zero elements are repeated in a block pattern, where each block is a 2x2, 3x3, or 5x5 grid depending on the number of non-zero elements in the input grid.
   - The position of the non-zero elements in the input grid determines the position of the corresponding blocks in the output grid.

3. **Deduce a transformation rule and confirm that it works on the examples given:**
   - The transformation rule is as follows:
     - Count the number of non-zero elements in the input grid.
     - Multiply the input grid size by the number of non-zero elements to get the output grid size.
     - For each non-zero element in the input grid, create a block of the same size as the number of non-zero elements, filled with the value of the non-zero element.
     - Place the blocks in the output grid at the corresponding positions as in the input grid.

4. **Apply the transformation rule to the test case:**
   - The test case input is:
     [
     [1, 0, 0],
     [0, 9, 6],
     [8, 0, 0]
     ]
   - Count the number of non-zero elements: 4 (1, 9, 6, 8).
   - The output grid size will be 3x3 * 4 = 12x12.
   - Create blocks for each non-zero element:
     - 1: 4x4 block of 1s.
     - 9: 4x4 block of 9s.
     - 6: 4x4 block of 6s.
     - 8: 4x4 block of 8s.
   - Place the blocks in the output grid at the corresponding positions.

   - The inner part of the grid is modified. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain colors with others.
   - In Example 1, the red (2) and purple (8) colors are replaced with a pattern of red (2) and purple (8) in a checkerboard-like pattern.
   - In Example 2, the yellow (4) and blue (1) colors are replaced with a pattern of yellow (4) and blue (1) in a checkerboard-like pattern.
   - In Example 3, the green (3) and red (2) colors are replaced with a pattern of green (3) and red (2) in a checkerboard-like pattern.

3. **Deduce a transformation rule and confirm that it works on the examples given:**
   - The transformation rule appears to be: Replace the inner colors with a checkerboard pattern of the same colors.
   - The checkerboard pattern starts with the color of the top-left cell of the inner part of the grid.
   - This rule works for all the given examples.

4. **Apply the transformation rule to the test case:**

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - The input grid size is consistently 9x4.
   - The output grid size is consistently 4x4.

2. **Analyze the changes between input and output:**
   - The output grid is a smaller version of the input grid, specifically the top-left 4x4 section of the input grid.
   - The output grid contains only the color green (3) and black (0).

3. **Determine the transformation rule:**
   - The output grid is derived from the top-left 4x4 section of the input grid.
   - The transformation rule appears to be: 
     - If the cell in the top-left 4x4 section of the input grid contains the color orange (7), it is transformed to green (3) in the output grid.
     - All other colors in the top-left 4x4 section of the input grid are transformed to black (0) in the output grid.

4. **Confirm the transformation rule on the examples:**
   - Example 1: The top-left 4x4 section of the input grid contains orange (7) at positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), and (3,2). These positions are transformed to green (3) in the output grid, and all other positions are black (0).
   - Example 2: The top-left 4x4 section of the input grid contains orange (7) at positions (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), and (3,3). These positions are transformed to green (3) in the output grid, and all other positions are black (0).
   - Example 3: The top-left 4x4 section of the input grid contains orange (7) at positions (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,0), and (3,1). These positions are transformed to green (3) in the output grid, and all other positions are black (0).
   - Example 4: The top-left 4x4 section of the input grid contains orange (7) at positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), and (3,2). These positions are transformed to green (3) in the output grid, and all other positions are black (0).

5. **Apply the transformation rule to the test case:**

   - Test Case: Input (16x16), Output (16x16)
   - The output grid size is the same as the input grid size in all cases.

2. **Observation of Changes:**
   - In all examples, the non-zero values in the input grid are surrounded by a 3x3 block of a specific color in the output grid.
   - The center of the 3x3 block corresponds to the position of the non-zero value in the input grid.
   - The color of the 3x3 block depends on the value in the input grid:
     - Green (3) is surrounded by pink (6).
     - Red (2) is surrounded by blue (1).
     - Purple (8) is surrounded by yellow (4).

3. **Transformation Rule:**
   - For each non-zero value in the input grid:
     - Create a 3x3 block centered at the position of the non-zero value.
     - The color of the 3x3 block is determined by the value:
       - Green (3) -> Pink (6)
       - Red (2) -> Blue (1)
       - Purple (8) -> Yellow (4)
     - The center of the 3x3 block retains the original color.

4. **Confirmation on Examples:**
   - Example 1: Green (3) at (6,1) is surrounded by pink (6), red (2) at (7,8) is surrounded by blue (1), and purple (8) at (5,5) is surrounded by yellow (4).
   - Example 2: Green (3) at (2,3) is surrounded by pink (6).
   - Example 3: Green (3) at (4,13) is surrounded by pink (6), red (2) at (11,4) is surrounded by blue (1).
   - Example 4: Purple (8) at (3,2) is surrounded by yellow (4).

1. **Grid Size Analysis:**
   - The input and output grids in all examples are of the same size, 19x19.

2. **Observation of Changes:**
   - In the output grids, the non-zero values from the input grid are preserved.
   - New non-zero values are added in a specific pattern around the non-zero values from the input grid.

3. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - For each non-zero value in the input grid, a horizontal line of the same color is drawn across the row.
   - Additionally, a vertical line of the same color is drawn down the column.
   - The lines do not overwrite existing non-zero values but fill in the gaps between them.

4. **Sub-Conclusion:**
   - The transformation rule involves extending horizontal and vertical lines from each non-zero value in the input grid, filling in the gaps with the same color.

5. **Test Case Application:**
   - Apply the transformation rule to the test case input grid.
   - Identify all non-zero values and draw horizontal and vertical lines from them.

1. **Grid Size Analysis:**
   - All input and output grids are 10x10 in size. This indicates that the transformation rule does not change the dimensions of the grid.

2. **Observation of Changes:**
   - In the examples, the black (0) cells remain unchanged.
   - The blue (1) cells are replaced by a new color, which is determined by the color of the central cell within the blue shape.
   - The central cell within the blue shape is the one that is not black (0) and is surrounded by blue (1) cells.

3. **Transformation Rule:**
   - Identify the blue (1) shapes in the input grid.
   - For each blue shape, find the central cell that is not black (0).
   - Replace all blue (1) cells within that shape with the color of the central cell.

4. **Confirmation on Examples:**
   - **Example 1:** The central cell within the blue shape is red (2). All blue cells are replaced by red (2).
   - **Example 2:** There are two blue shapes. The central cell of the top shape is red (2), and the central cell of the bottom shape is green (3). All blue cells in the top shape are replaced by red (2), and all blue cells in the bottom shape are replaced by green (3).
   - **Example 3:** The central cell within the blue shape is pink (6). All blue cells are replaced by pink (6).

5. **Test Case Solution:**
   - Identify the blue (1) shapes in the test case.
   - The top blue shape has a central cell that is yellow (4). Replace all blue cells in this shape with yellow (4).
   - The bottom blue shape has a central cell that is orange (7). Replace all blue cells in this shape with orange (7).

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - All input and output grids are 10x10.

2. **Analyze the changes between input and output:**
   - In all examples, the original colored squares remain in the same position.
   - Green squares (value 3) are added in specific patterns around the original colored squares.

3. **Identify the pattern of green squares:**
   - In Example 1, green squares are added below the original colored squares.
   - In Example 2, green squares are added below the original colored squares.
   - In Example 3, green squares are added below the original colored squares.

4. **Deduce the transformation rule:**

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - All input grids are 3x3.
   - All output grids are 1x1.

2. **Look at both, the integer representation and the image, to determine what stays the same and what changes between input and output:**
   - The input grids consist of red (2) and black (0) squares.
   - The output grids are either blue (1) or orange (7).
   - The output color seems to depend on the pattern of red and black squares in the input grid.

3. **Deduce a transformation rule and confirm that it works on the examples given:**
   - In Example 1, the input has a checkerboard pattern of red and black squares. The output is blue (1).
   - In Example 2, the input has a pattern where the red squares are not in a checkerboard pattern. The output is orange (7).
   - In Example 3, the input has a pattern where the red squares are in a vertical line. The output is blue (1).
   - In Example 4, the input has a pattern where the red squares are in a horizontal line. The output is blue (1).
   - In Example 5, the input has a pattern where the red squares are not in a checkerboard pattern. The output is orange (7).
   - In Example 6, the input has a pattern where the red squares are not in a checkerboard pattern. The output is orange (7).

   From these observations, the rule seems to be:
   - If the red squares form a checkerboard pattern or a line (either vertical or horizontal), the output is blue (1).
   - If the red squares do not form a checkerboard pattern or a line, the output is orange (7).

4. **Solve the test case:**
   - The test case input is:
     [
     [2, 0, 2],
     [2, 2, 2],
     [2, 0, 2]
     ]
   - The red squares form a line (both vertical and horizontal). Therefore, the output should be blue (1).

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - All input and output grids are 10x10.

2. **Analyze the changes between input and output:**
   - In all examples, the purple (8) cells in the input grid remain purple in the output grid.
   - New purple cells are added in the output grid, forming a continuous path or shape that connects the original purple cells.

3. **Deduce the transformation rule:**
   - The rule appears to be that new purple cells are added to connect all the original purple cells in the input grid, forming a continuous path or shape.
   - The new purple cells are added in such a way that they form the shortest possible path or shape that connects all the original purple cells.

4. **Confirm the rule on the examples:**
   - In Example 1, the original purple cells are connected horizontally and vertically to form a continuous path.
   - In Example 2, the original purple cells are connected vertically and horizontally to form a continuous path.
   - In Example 3, the original purple cells are connected in a more complex shape to form a continuous path.

5. **Apply the rule to the test case:**
   - The original purple cells in the test case are at positions (1,1), (2,3), (3,7), (5,1), and (8,4) and (8,7).
   - To connect these cells, we need to add new purple cells in such a way that they form the shortest possible path or shape.
   - The resulting output grid should have new purple cells added to connect all the original purple cells.

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - The input grids vary in size, but the output grids are consistently 3x3.
   - This suggests that the transformation rule involves reducing the input grid to a 3x3 output grid.

2. **Analyze the integer representation and image:**
   - In all examples, the red squares (value 2) are the only non-zero values in the input grids.
   - The output grids contain blue squares (value 1) in specific positions.

3. **Identify patterns in the transformation:**
   - In Example 1, the top-left 2x2 block of red squares in the input results in a blue square in the top-left corner of the output.
   - In Example 2, the top-left and bottom-right 2x2 blocks of red squares in the input result in blue squares in the top-left and bottom-right corners of the output.
   - In Example 3, the top-left, top-right, and center 2x2 blocks of red squares in the input result in blue squares in the top-left, top-right, and center of the output.
   - This pattern suggests that each 2x2 block of red squares in the input corresponds to a blue square in the output at a specific position.

4. **Deduce the transformation rule:**
   - The output grid is a 3x3 grid.
   - Each 2x2 block of red squares in the input grid corresponds to a blue square in the output grid at a specific position.
   - The position of the blue square in the output grid is determined by the position of the 2x2 block of red squares in the input grid.

5. **Confirm the rule on the examples:**
   - The rule holds for all given examples. Each 2x2 block of red squares in the input results in a blue square in the output at the corresponding position.

6. **Apply the rule to the test case:**
   - The test case input grid is:
     [
     [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0],
     [2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0],
     [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     ]
   - Identify the 2x2 blocks of red squares:
     - Top-left: [2, 2], [2, 2] -> blue square in top-left of output.
     - Top-right: [2, 2], [2, 2] -> blue square in top-right of output.
     - Center: [2, 2], [2, 2] -> blue square in center of output.
   - The output grid will be:
     [
     [1, 0, 1],
     [0, 1, 0],
     [0, 0, 0]

1. **Determine the input and output grid sizes:**
   - Example 1: Input (24x20), Output (3x3)
   - Example 2: Input (23x22), Output (3x3)
   - Example 3: Input (23x24), Output (3x3)
   - Test case: Input (26x26), Output should be (3x3)

2. **Analyze the transformation:**
   - The output grid is always 3x3, regardless of the input size.
   - The output grid seems to represent a simplified version of the input grid, focusing on the most prominent color in specific regions.

3. **Identify the regions:**
   - The output grid is divided into 9 regions (3x3), each corresponding to a portion of the input grid.
   - Each region in the output grid represents the most common color in the corresponding section of the input grid.

4. **Determine the most common color in each region:**
   - For Example 1:
     - Top-left: Most common color is purple (8)
     - Top-middle: Most common color is black (0)
     - Top-right: Most common color is purple (8)
     - Middle-left: Most common color is black (0)
     - Middle-middle: Most common color is purple (8)
     - Middle-right: Most common color is black (0)
     - Bottom-left: Most common color is purple (8)
     - Bottom-middle: Most common color is purple (8)
     - Bottom-right: Most common color is purple (8)
   - This pattern holds for the other examples as well.

5. **Apply the transformation to the test case:**
   - Divide the 26x26 input grid into 9 regions (each approximately 8x8 or 9x9).
   - Determine the most common color in each region.
   - Place the most common color in the corresponding cell of the 3x3 output grid.

6. **Solve the test case:**
   - Top-left: Most common color is black (0)
   - Top-middle: Most common color is yellow (4)
   - Top-right: Most common color is black (0)
   - Middle-left: Most common color is yellow (4)
   - Middle-middle: Most common color is yellow (4)
   - Middle-right: Most common color is black (0)
   - Bottom-left: Most common color is yellow (4)
   - Bottom-middle: Most common color is yellow (4)
   - Bottom-right: Most common color is black (0)
