To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Grid Size Reduction**: The output grid is always a 4x4 grid, regardless of the input grid size. This suggests that the transformation involves reducing the grid size.

2. **Color Aggregation**: The output grid seems to aggregate colors from specific regions of the input grid. By comparing the input and output grids, we can infer that the output grid is formed by taking the most frequent color from specific 2x2 sub-grids of the input grid.

3. **Mapping**: The transformation appears to map each 2x2 sub-grid of the input to a single color in the output grid. The color chosen seems to be the most frequent color in that 2x2 sub-grid. If there is a tie, the color with the highest value is chosen.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
- Divide the input grid into 2x2 sub-grids.
- For each 2x2 sub-grid, determine the most frequent color.
- If there is a tie, choose the color with the highest value.
- Construct the 4x4 output grid using these colors.

The transformation rule appears to involve duplicating certain patterns in the input grid to create the output grid. Specifically, the rule seems to be:

1. For each row in the input grid, if a non-zero value is present, it is duplicated in the subsequent rows in a specific pattern.
2. The pattern involves placing the non-zero value in alternating positions in the subsequent rows.
3. The pattern also seems to involve placing the non-zero value in the row directly below the original non-zero value and in the row two positions below the original non-zero value.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing the central column of the input grid with the color of the surrounding squares in the same row. Specifically, if a row contains a sequence of the same color on both sides of the central column, that color is used to replace the central column in the output grid. This rule is applied to each row individually.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In Example 1, the central column (index 3 and 4) is replaced with the color 3, which is the color surrounding it in the rows where it appears.
- In Example 2, the central column is replaced with the color 6, which is the color surrounding it in the rows where it appears.
- In Example 3, the central column is replaced with the color 1, which is the color surrounding it in the rows where it appears.
- In Example 4, the central column is replaced with the color 2, which is the color surrounding it in the rows where it appears.

Given this pattern, we can apply the same rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve several steps:

1. **Boundary Detection**: The transformation seems to focus on the boundaries of the colored regions in the input grid. Specifically, it identifies the outermost squares of each contiguous region of non-zero values.

2. **Boundary Extraction**: The output grid is constructed by extracting these boundary squares and placing them in a new grid. The new grid is smaller and only includes the boundary squares.

3. **Color Propagation**: The colors of the boundary squares are propagated to fill the new grid. This means that if a boundary square is part of a larger contiguous region, its color will be propagated to fill the corresponding region in the output grid.

4. **Symmetry and Alignment**: The output grid is aligned such that the boundaries are symmetric and the colors are propagated in a way that maintains the structure of the original grid.

By observing the examples, we can see that the output grid is a condensed version of the input grid, focusing on the boundaries of the colored regions.

The transformation rule appears to involve several steps:

1. **Grid Expansion**: The output grid is always larger than the input grid. Specifically, the output grid seems to be expanded by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, with additional rows and columns added to maintain the structure.

2. **Color Replacement**: The color '0' in the input grid is consistently replaced by '8' in the output grid. This suggests that '0' is a special case that gets transformed into '8'.

3. **Pattern Maintenance**: The non-zero values in the input grid are maintained in the output grid, but they are surrounded by '8's or '0's in a specific pattern. The pattern seems to involve alternating '8's and '0's around the non-zero values.

4. **Border Addition**: Additional rows and columns are added to the output grid, often filled with '8's or '0's, depending on the position and value of the surrounding cells in the input grid.

By analyzing the examples, we can see that the transformation involves expanding the grid, replacing '0' with '8', and maintaining the non-zero values in a structured pattern.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting the grid across a vertical axis and then shifting the colors to the right. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve the following steps:

1. Reflect the grid across the vertical axis.
2. Shift the colors to the right by a certain number of columns, wrapping around to the left if necessary.

Let's analyze the examples to confirm this hypothesis:

- In Example 1, the input grid is reflected and then shifted to the right by 1 column.
- In Example 2, the input grid is reflected and then shifted to the right by 1 column.
- In Example 3, the input grid is reflected and then shifted to the right by 1 column.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling the grid with a specific pattern of the number 2, except where the original grid has a 5. The pattern seems to be a diagonal stripe of 2s, starting from the top-left corner and moving down to the bottom-right corner. The 5s in the input grid remain as 5s in the output grid, and they seem to disrupt the pattern of 2s.

Let's break down the pattern:
- The 2s start from the top-left corner and move diagonally down to the bottom-right corner.
- The 2s also appear in a vertical stripe starting from the second column and moving down.
- The 5s in the input grid remain as 5s in the output grid and disrupt the pattern of 2s.

Given this pattern, we can infer the transformation rule and apply it to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain colors (integers) with other colors based on specific patterns observed in the input-output pairs. Let's analyze the examples to deduce the rule:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has several distinct regions of colors.
   - The output grid seems to have the same regions but with some colors replaced.
   - Notably, the color `9` in the input is replaced by `0` in the output, and the color `0` in the input is replaced by `9` in the output.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Similar to Example 1, the color `9` in the input is replaced by `0` in the output, and the color `0` in the input is replaced by `9` in the output.
   - Additionally, there are regions where the colors `3` and `4` are swapped.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The color `9` in the input is replaced by `0` in the output, and the color `0` in the input is replaced by `9` in the output.
   - There are also regions where the colors `4` and `5` are swapped.

4. **Example 4**:
   - The color `9` in the input is replaced by `0` in the output, and the color `0` in the input is replaced by `9` in the output.
   - There are regions where the colors `3` and `4` are swapped.

From these observations, we can infer the following transformation rules:
- Replace `9` with `0`.
- Replace `0` with `9`.
- Swap `3` and `4`.
- Swap `4` and `5`.

Let's apply these rules to the test case.

  The output grid is filled with the value 4, which is the maximum value in the input grid.

  The output grid is filled with the value 6, which is the maximum value in the input grid.

From these examples, it is clear that the transformation rule is to find the maximum value in the input grid and then create an output grid where every element is replaced with this maximum value.

The maximum value in the input grid is 9.

Therefore, the output grid should be:

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Boundary Detection**: The output grids seem to be bounded by the color `2`. This suggests that the transformation involves identifying the boundary of the input grid and converting it to `2`.

2. **Internal Structure**: The internal structure of the output grid appears to be a simplified version of the input grid, with certain colors transformed or removed.

3. **Color Mapping**: Specific colors in the input grid are mapped to specific colors in the output grid. For example, `8` in the input often maps to `8` in the output, and `3` in the input often maps to `3` in the output.

4. **Symmetry and Simplification**: The output grids are often simplified versions of the input grids, with fewer colors and more uniform patterns.

Given these observations, the transformation rule likely involves:
- Identifying the boundary of the input grid and setting it to `2`.
- Mapping specific colors to specific colors in the output grid.
- Simplifying the internal structure while preserving key features.

From these examples, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- The output grid is formed by taking the maximum value from each column of the input grid.
- If a column has no non-zero values, it is replaced by zeros in the output grid.
- The output grid is formed by taking the maximum value from each column of the input grid.
- If a column has no non-zero values, it is replaced by zeros in the output grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Applying the transformation rule:
- Column 1: Max value is 2
- Column 2: Max value is 5
- Column 3: Max value is 0
- Column 4: Max value is 5
- Column 5: Max value is 5

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

**Example 1:**
- The input grid has a pattern of 5s surrounded by 0s.
- The output grid replaces the 5s with a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and increasing by 1 for each new contiguous block of 5s.
- The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 are used to represent the different contiguous blocks of 5s.

**Example 2:**
- The input grid has a similar pattern but with fewer 5s.
- The output grid follows the same rule, replacing the 5s with a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and increasing by 1 for each new contiguous block of 5s.
- The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 are used to represent the different contiguous blocks of 5s.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is:
- Replace each contiguous block of 5s with a unique number starting from 1 and increasing by 1 for each new block.
- The numbering starts from the top-left corner and moves right and down.

**Test Case:**
- The input grid has a pattern of 5s surrounded by 0s.
- We need to replace each contiguous block of 5s with a unique number starting from 1 and increasing by 1 for each new block.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding the input grid by adding rows below the initial row. Each new row is created by copying the last non-zero value from the previous row and appending it to the end of the new row. This process continues until all values in the row are zero. The number of rows added depends on the number of non-zero values in the input row.

For example, in Example 1, the input is [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output has three rows because there are three non-zero values (1, 1, 0). The first row is the same as the input. The second row copies the last non-zero value (1) and appends it to the end of the new row. The third row does the same, resulting in [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0].

In Example 2, the input is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output has four rows because there is one non-zero value (2). The first row is the same as the input. The second row copies the last non-zero value (2) and appends it to the end of the new row. The third and fourth rows do the same, resulting in [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Applying this rule to the test case, the input is [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. There are three non-zero values (1, 1, 1), so the output should have four rows. The first row is the same as the input. The second row copies the last non-zero value (1) and appends it to the end of the new row. The third and fourth rows do the same, resulting in [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding the input grid into a larger grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. Each cell in the input grid is transformed into a 2x2 block in the output grid. The transformation rule seems to be as follows:

1. If the input cell value is 0, the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid is filled with 8s.
2. If the input cell value is not 0, the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid is filled with the input cell value, except for the bottom-right corner, which is filled with 8.

Additionally, the output grid is surrounded by a border of 8s.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve several steps:

1. **Border Detection**: The output grid seems to have a border of a specific color (in this case, color 2) around the non-zero elements of the input grid.
2. **Color Mapping**: The non-zero elements in the input grid are mapped to specific colors in the output grid. For example, in Example 1, the color 8 in the input is mapped to color 8 in the output, and color 2 in the input is mapped to color 2 in the output.
3. **Grid Size**: The output grid is smaller than the input grid, and it seems to be centered around the non-zero elements of the input grid.
4. **Symmetry**: The output grid appears to be symmetric around the center of the non-zero elements.

Given these observations, let's apply these steps to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting certain colored squares (represented by non-zero integers) downwards until they encounter a boundary (represented by zeros) or another colored square. The transformation does not affect the zero values, which remain in place. Additionally, the transformation seems to stop when it encounters a row of zeros.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the '4' and '5' squares are shifted downwards until they hit the boundary of zeros.
2. In Example 2, the '2' and '4' squares are shifted downwards similarly.
3. In Example 3, the '2' and '3' squares are shifted downwards.

The transformation rule can be summarized as:
- Shift each non-zero value downwards until it hits a boundary of zeros or another non-zero value.
- Stop the transformation when a row of zeros is encountered.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values in the input grid with a specific pattern based on their position and the values around them. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve:
1. Leaving the border values (0s and the outermost layer of the grid) unchanged.
2. Replacing certain values within the grid with a pattern that extends from the center outwards.

From the examples, we can observe:
- In Example 1, the value 2 is replaced with a pattern that extends to the right and downwards.
- In Example 2, the value 9 is replaced with a pattern that extends to the right and downwards.
- In Example 3, the value 3 is replaced with a pattern that extends to the right and downwards.

The pattern seems to be that if a value (other than 0 or the border value) is surrounded by a certain color, it gets replaced by that color in a specific direction (right and downwards).

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve converting the color 5 into a pattern of colors 1, 2, and 4. Specifically, the color 5 is transformed into a 3x3 pattern where:
- The center of the pattern is 2.
- The top, bottom, left, and right of the center are 4.
- The corners of the pattern are 1.

This pattern is applied to each occurrence of the color 5 in the input grid. If a 5 is on the edge or corner of the grid, the pattern will be truncated to fit within the grid boundaries.

Additionally, the transformation seems to be applied in a way that maintains the overall structure of the input grid, with the transformed pattern replacing the original 5s.

The transformation rule appears to involve converting certain values in the input grid to a different set of values in the output grid. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with sequences of '1's and '4's, and sometimes '0's, based on the surrounding values.

Here are some observations:
1. In Example 1, the '4's in the input are often replaced by sequences of '1's and '4's in the output.
2. In Example 2, the '4's in the input are also replaced by sequences of '1's and '4's, and sometimes '0's.
3. In Example 3, the '4's in the input are replaced by sequences of '1's and '4's, and sometimes '0's.
4. In Example 4, the '4's in the input are replaced by sequences of '1's and '4's, and sometimes '0's.

The transformation rule seems to be:
- Replace '4' with '1' if it is surrounded by '1's.
- Replace '4' with '4' if it is surrounded by '4's.
- Replace '4' with '0' if it is surrounded by '0's.

Additionally, the transformation seems to involve spreading the '1's and '4's to adjacent cells if they are not already present.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: Contains values 0 and 5.
   - Output: Contains values 0, 1, 2, 3, 5.
   - Observations:
     - 0s in the input are transformed into 1s, 2s, or 3s in the output.
     - 5s in the input remain 5s in the output.
     - The transformation seems to depend on the surrounding values.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: Contains values 0 and 5.
   - Output: Contains values 0, 1, 2, 3, 5.
   - Observations:
     - 0s in the input are transformed into 1s, 2s, or 3s in the output.
     - 5s in the input remain 5s in the output.
     - The transformation seems to depend on the surrounding values.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: Contains values 0 and 5.
   - Output: Contains values 0, 1, 2, 3, 5.
   - Observations:
     - 0s in the input are transformed into 1s, 2s, or 3s in the output.
     - 5s in the input remain 5s in the output.
     - The transformation seems to depend on the surrounding values.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves changing 0s to 1s, 2s, or 3s based on the surrounding values. Specifically, it seems that 0s are transformed based on the number of adjacent 5s:
- If a 0 is surrounded by 2 or more 5s, it becomes a 1.
- If a 0 is surrounded by 1 5, it becomes a 2.
- If a 0 is surrounded by 0 5s, it becomes a 3.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve reducing the input grid to a single row where each element represents a unique color from the input grid. The output grid is formed by taking the unique colors from each column of the input grid, starting from the leftmost column and moving to the right. If a column contains the same color in all rows, it is represented as a single element in the output. If a column contains different colors, each unique color is represented in the output.

Let's analyze the examples:

- Example 1: The input has columns of [1, 2, 1]. The output is [1, 2, 1], which are the unique colors from each column.
- Example 2: The input has columns of [3, 4, 6]. The output is [3, 4, 6], which are the unique colors from each column.
- Example 3: The input has columns of [2, 3, 3, 8, 1]. The output is [2, 3, 8, 1], which are the unique colors from each column.
- Example 4: The input has columns of [2, 6, 8, 8]. The output is [2, 6, 8], which are the unique colors from each column.
- Example 5: The input has columns of [4, 4, 2, 2, 8, 3]. The output is [4, 2, 8, 3], which are the unique colors from each column.

Based on this pattern, the transformation rule is to take the unique colors from each column of the input grid and form a single row in the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting the colored squares (non-zero values) to the right and down by one position, while keeping the top-left corner at (0,0). This is evident from the examples provided:

- In Example 1, the '6' values and '2' values are shifted to the right and down by one position.
- In Example 2, the '8' values are shifted similarly.

The transformation does not affect the zero values, which remain in their original positions.

Given this rule, we can apply it to the test case to determine the output.

The transformation rule appears to involve adding a specific color (represented by the integer 4) to the grid in a particular pattern. Observing the examples, we see that the color 4 is added to the bottom row of the grid, specifically in positions that are directly below the rightmost and leftmost occurrences of any non-zero color in the second-to-last row of the input grid.

For example, in Example 1, the rightmost and leftmost occurrences of non-zero colors in the second-to-last row are at positions (3, 6) and (3, 7). Therefore, the output grid has 4s added at positions (7, 3) and (7, 7).

In Example 2, the rightmost and leftmost occurrences of non-zero colors in the second-to-last row are at positions (1, 3) and (1, 4). Therefore, the output grid has a 4 added at position (4, 3).

In Example 3, the rightmost and leftmost occurrences of non-zero colors in the second-to-last row are at positions (2, 6) and (2, 7). Therefore, the output grid has 4s added at positions (4, 6) and (4, 7).

Following this pattern, we can determine the positions for the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input:

     [4, 5, 4],
     [5, 5, 5],
     [4, 5, 4]

   - Output:

     [0, 4, 0],
     [4, 4, 4],
     [0, 4, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output seems to be a transformation where the central value of the input grid is preserved, and the surrounding values are transformed to 0 if they are not the central value.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```

     [5, 5, 6, 6, 6],

   - Observation: The output seems to be a transformation where the central value of the input grid is preserved, and the surrounding values are transformed to 0 if they are not the central value.

     [0, 0, 9, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 9, 9]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output seems to be a transformation where the central value of the input grid is preserved, and the surrounding values are transformed to 0 if they are not the central value.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves preserving the central value of the input grid and transforming the surrounding values to 0 if they are not the central value. The central value is the value that appears most frequently in the grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples. We need to identify patterns or rules that convert the input grid to the output grid.

### Observations:
1. **Example 1:**
   - The input and output grids are almost identical, with a few changes.
   - The changes seem to involve specific values being replaced or modified.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Similar to Example 1, the input and output grids are almost identical.
   - There are specific changes, particularly around the value `8`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Again, the input and output grids are almost identical.
   - Specific values, particularly `4`, are transformed.

### Hypothesis:
- The transformation rule seems to involve replacing specific values with other values.
- The value `8` in the input grid is transformed into a sequence of values in the output grid.
- The value `4` in the input grid is transformed into a sequence of values in the output grid.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Example 1:**
  - The value `8` in the input grid is transformed into a sequence of values in the output grid.
  - The value `2` in the input grid is transformed into a sequence of values in the output grid.

- **Example 2:**
  - The value `8` in the input grid is transformed into a sequence of values in the output grid.
  - The value `4` in the input grid is transformed into a sequence of values in the output grid.

- **Example 3:**
  - The value `4` in the input grid is transformed into a sequence of values in the output grid.

### Conclusion:
The transformation rule involves replacing specific values with sequences of values. Specifically, the value `8` is replaced with a sequence of values, and the value `4` is replaced with a sequence of values.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain zeros with the number 2 in a diagonal pattern, starting from the bottom-right corner and moving upwards to the left. Additionally, the bottom row is filled with the number 4. The specific pattern seems to depend on the dimensions of the input grid.

Let's break down the examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input is a 15x15 grid with a diagonal pattern of 2s starting from the bottom-right corner and moving upwards to the left. The bottom row is filled with 4s.
2. **Example 2**: The input is a 3x3 grid with a similar diagonal pattern of 2s. The bottom row is filled with 4s.
3. **Example 3**: The input is a 7x7 grid with a diagonal pattern of 2s. The bottom row is filled with 4s.

The pattern of 2s seems to start from the bottom-right corner and move diagonally upwards to the left, filling in the zeros. The number of 2s in each row decreases as we move up the grid. The bottom row is always filled with 4s.

For the test case, which is a 10x10 grid, we can apply the same rule:
- Start from the bottom-right corner and move diagonally upwards to the left, replacing zeros with 2s.
- Fill the bottom row with 4s.

The transformation rule appears to involve several steps:

1. **Identify Non-Zero Values**: The transformation seems to focus on non-zero values in the input grid.
2. **Expand Non-Zero Values**: Each non-zero value in the input grid is expanded into a 3x3 block in the output grid. The center of this block is the non-zero value itself.
3. **Fill Surrounding Values**: The surrounding values in the 3x3 block are filled with a specific pattern. This pattern involves the value itself and a fixed value (5 in the examples).
4. **Handle Overlaps**: If multiple 3x3 blocks overlap, the output grid will show the combined effect of these overlaps.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [5, 0, 0],
     [3, 5, 0],
     [0, 0, 5]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [5, 3, 0],
     [0, 5, 0],
     [0, 0, 5]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The transformation seems to shift the non-zero values to the left within each row.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [5, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 5, 0, 0],
     [6, 0, 5, 0],
     [6, 0, 4, 5]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [5, 0, 6, 6],
     [0, 5, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 5, 4],
     [0, 0, 0, 5]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The transformation shifts the non-zero values to the left within each row, and if there are multiple non-zero values in a row, they are shifted to the leftmost positions.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
     [8, 8, 5, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 0, 5, 0],
     [0, 2, 0, 1, 5]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [5, 0, 8, 0, 0],
     [0, 5, 8, 2, 2],
     [0, 0, 5, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 5, 1],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The transformation shifts the non-zero values to the left within each row, and if there are multiple non-zero values in a row, they are shifted to the leftmost positions.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each row, shift all non-zero values to the leftmost positions, filling the remaining positions with zeros.

</reasoning>

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```

[2, 0, 8, 8, 5, 0],
[2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]

```

Applying the transformation rule:
1. First row: `[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
2. Second row: `[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
3. Third row: `[3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]`
4. Fourth row: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]` -> `[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
5. Fifth row: `[2, 0, 8, 8, 5, 0]` -> `[2, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0]`

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting the non-zero values down by one row at a time, wrapping around to the top row when they reach the bottom. This is evident from the examples provided:

- In Example 1, the row of 1s moves down one row.
- In Example 2, the row of 1s moves down one row and wraps around to the top.
- In Example 3, the non-zero values shift down one row.
- In Example 4, the non-zero values shift down one row.

Given this pattern, the transformation rule is to shift all non-zero values down by one row, with the bottom row wrapping around to the top row.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a '3' at (3,3) and (4,8).
   - The output grid has '3' at (3,3), (4,2), (4,8), and (9,11).
   - The '7' at (6,11) in the input grid is transformed to (10,11) in the output grid.
   - The '1' at (10,11) in the input grid is transformed to (10,11) in the output grid.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid has a '7' at (0,3) and (2,3).
   - The output grid has '7' at (1,3), (2,3), and (8,3).
   - The '1' at (2,3) in the input grid is transformed to (2,3) in the output grid.
   - The '3' at (10,11) in the input grid is transformed to (10,11) in the output grid.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input grid has a '3' at (0,6) and (11,14).
   - The output grid has '3' at (10,6), (11,14), and (14,6).
   - The '7' at (6,0) in the input grid is transformed to (6,9) in the output grid.
   - The '1' at (6,10) in the input grid is transformed to (6,10) in the output grid.
   - The '2' at (11,6) in the input grid is transformed to (11,6) in the output grid.

From these observations, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- Each non-zero value in the input grid is shifted down by one row and to the right by one column in the output grid.
- If the value is on the bottom row or rightmost column, it wraps around to the top row or leftmost column, respectively.
- The '0' values remain unchanged.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in certain areas with the value 4, starting from specific points and spreading outwards. Specifically, the value 4 seems to propagate from the positions of the values 8 and 2 in the input grid. The propagation happens in a way that fills the entire row and column of the starting point, as well as the diagonals extending from that point.

Let's break down the examples:

1. In Example 1, the value 8 at (2, 1) and the value 2 at (8, 9) cause the propagation of 4s in their respective rows, columns, and diagonals.
2. In Example 2, the value 8 at (1, 8) and the value 2 at (5, 0) cause similar propagation.
3. In Example 3, the value 8 at (10, 1) and the value 2 at (1, 8) cause the propagation.

The propagation seems to stop at the boundaries of the grid or when it encounters a value other than 0.

Given this understanding, we can apply the same rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying distinct regions or shapes within the input grid and then mapping these regions to a smaller grid. The output grid seems to be a 2D representation of the unique shapes or patterns found in the input grid.

From the examples, we can observe the following:
1. The input grid is divided into distinct regions based on the color values.
2. Each unique region is then mapped to a smaller grid, where the position and shape of the region are preserved.
3. The output grid is a 2D array where each element represents a unique region from the input grid.

Let's analyze the examples:
- In Example 1, the input grid has a large central rectangle of color 2, surrounded by color 3 on the top and bottom, and color 0 on the sides. The output grid represents this structure in a smaller form.
- In Example 2, the input grid has a similar structure but with different colors. The output grid represents the unique regions in a smaller form.
- In Example 3, the input grid has a more complex structure with multiple regions. The output grid represents these regions in a smaller form.

Given this, the transformation rule seems to be:
1. Identify distinct regions in the input grid based on color values.
2. Map these regions to a smaller grid while preserving their relative positions and shapes.

For the test case, we need to identify the distinct regions and map them to a smaller grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the unique colors (integer values) present in the input grid and then listing them in a single column in the output grid. The order of the colors in the output seems to follow the order in which they first appear in the input grid from top to bottom and left to right.

Let's analyze the examples:

- **Example 1**: The input grid contains the colors 4, 2, and 8. The output grid lists these colors in the order they first appear: [4, 2, 8].
- **Example 2**: The input grid contains the colors 2, 8, and 5. The output grid lists these colors in the order they first appear: [2, 8, 5].
- **Example 3**: The input grid contains the colors 6, 4, 2, and 3. The output grid lists these colors in the order they first appear: [6, 4, 2, 3].

Given this pattern, the transformation rule is to identify the unique colors in the input grid and list them in the order they first appear in a single column in the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve spreading the non-background colors (non-1s in the first example, non-4s in the second example, and non-8s in the third example) to the right and downwards until they hit a boundary or another color. The background color remains unchanged. Additionally, the transformation seems to affect only the non-background colors and their immediate surroundings.

Let's break down the transformation rule:
1. Identify the background color (the most frequent color in the grid).
2. For each non-background color, spread it to the right and downwards until it hits a boundary (edge of the grid) or another color.
3. The background color remains unchanged.

In the test case, the background color is 3. We need to spread the non-background colors (4, 8, and 1) to the right and downwards.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in the gaps between non-zero values with the same value, and then placing a '5' in the middle of the sequence. Let's break down the examples:

- In Example 1, the input has a '1' at position (1,0) and a '2' at position (1,10). The output fills the gap between them with '1's and places a '5' in the middle.
- In Example 2, the input has a '3' at position (3,0) and a '7' at position (3,10). The output fills the gap between them with '3's and places a '5' in the middle.

The rule seems to be:
1. Identify the non-zero values in each row.
2. Fill the gaps between these non-zero values with the value on the left.
3. Place a '5' in the middle of the sequence, if there is an even number of gaps.
4. If there is an odd number of gaps, place a '5' in the middle of the sequence, and the remaining gaps are filled with the value on the left.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the value of certain cells based on the presence of specific patterns or neighbors. Specifically, the value of a cell seems to change to '2' when it is adjacent to a cell with the value '1'. This transformation is applied iteratively, and the changes propagate through the grid.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the cells that are adjacent to '1' in the input grid are transformed to '2' in the output grid.
2. In Example 2, the same pattern is observed. Cells adjacent to '1' are transformed to '2'.
3. In Example 3, the pattern continues with cells adjacent to '1' being transformed to '2'.

The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- If a cell is '1' and has a neighbor that is '1', it remains '1'.
- If a cell is '0' and has a neighbor that is '1', it becomes '2'.
- If a cell is '1' and has no neighbors that are '1', it remains '1'.
- If a cell is '0' and has no neighbors that are '1', it remains '0'.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Input Grid Dimensions**: Each input grid is a 4x14 matrix, and each output grid is a 3x3 matrix. This suggests that the transformation involves reducing the dimensions from 4x14 to 3x3.

2. **Color Transformation**: The input grids contain the colors 0 and 5. The output grids contain the colors 2, 3, 4, and 8. This indicates a mapping from the input colors to the output colors.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - In Example 1, the output grid has the same color in each row and column.
   - In Example 2, the output grid has the same color in each row and column.
   - In Example 3, the output grid has the same color in each row and column.
   - In Example 4, the output grid has the same color in each row and column.

4. **Transformation Rule**:
   - The transformation seems to involve counting the number of 0s in specific regions of the input grid and mapping these counts to specific colors in the output grid.
   - The regions seem to be defined by 3x3 sub-grids within the 4x14 input grid.

5. **Mapping Rule**:
   - Count the number of 0s in each 3x3 sub-grid of the input grid.
   - Map the count of 0s to a specific color in the output grid:
     - 0 0s -> 2
     - 1 0s -> 3
     - 2 0s -> 4
     - 3 0s -> 8

6. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**:
   - Divide the 4x14 input grid into three 3x3 sub-grids.
   - Count the number of 0s in each sub-grid.
   - Map the counts to the corresponding colors.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs.

**Example 1:**
- The input grid has a repeating pattern of colors.
- The output grid is identical to the input grid.

**Example 2:**
- The input grid has a repeating pattern of colors with some zeros.
- The output grid is a rearrangement of the input grid, where the rows are shifted down by one position, and the last row is moved to the first position.

**Example 3:**
- The input grid has a repeating pattern of colors with some zeros.
- The output grid is identical to the input grid, but the zeros are removed, and the pattern continues seamlessly.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves shifting rows down by one position and moving the last row to the first position. Additionally, any zeros in the grid are removed, and the pattern continues seamlessly.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [6, 6, 6],
     [1, 6, 1],
     [8, 8, 6]

     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output grid is the input grid with each element repeated twice horizontally.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [6, 8, 1],
     [6, 1, 1],
     [1, 1, 6]

     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output grid is the input grid with each element repeated twice horizontally, and the last column is a reflection of the first column.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [1, 1, 1],
     [8, 1, 6],

     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output grid is the input grid with each element repeated twice horizontally, and the last column is a reflection of the first column.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input:

     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output grid is the input grid with each element repeated twice horizontally, and the last column is a reflection of the first column.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Each element in the input grid is repeated twice horizontally.
- The last column is a reflection of the first column.

</reasoning>

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Input:
```
[
[6, 8, 6],
[8, 6, 8],
[1, 6, 1]

```

Applying the transformation rule:
1. Repeat each element twice horizontally.
2. Reflect the first column to form the last column.

Transformed Output:
```

The transformation rule appears to involve rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise and then reflecting it across the vertical axis. This is evident from the examples provided:

- In Example 1, the '7' values in the input grid are transformed to a pattern that matches a 90-degree clockwise rotation and vertical reflection.
- In Example 2, the '9' values in the input grid follow the same transformation rule.

Let's apply this rule to the test case to find the correct output.

From these examples, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- The output grid is a 4x4 grid.
- The transformation seems to involve checking the presence of the number 1 in the input grid and converting it to 3 in the output grid.
- The presence of the number 2 in the input grid seems to influence the output grid, but not directly.
- The number 4 in the input grid seems to act as a separator or delimiter, and the output grid does not include any rows or columns that are entirely 4s.
- The number 0 in the input grid seems to act as a separator or delimiter, and the output grid does not include any rows or columns that are entirely 0s.

Given this rule, let's apply it to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in areas around specific colors (represented by integers) with a new color (represented by the integer 1). The rule seems to be:

1. Identify the positions of specific colors (5 in the examples provided).
2. For each of these positions, fill in the surrounding area with the color 1, creating a connected region.
3. The filling stops at the boundaries of the grid or at other specific colors (like 5).

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve the propagation of the color 4 (or the value 4) in a specific manner. Here's the observed pattern:

1. The color 4 spreads to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) if those cells are currently 0.
2. The color 4 does not spread diagonally.
3. The color 4 does not overwrite other colors; it only affects cells that are currently 0.
4. The color 2 seems to be a result of the propagation of the color 4, but it only appears in specific patterns and does not overwrite other colors.

Given these observations, let's apply the rule to the test case.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 8, 1, 0],
     [0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0],
     [0, 1, 8, 0, 8, 8, 1, 0],
     [0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [0, 6, 0, 2],
     [6, 6, 2, 0],
     [7, 0, 4, 4],
     [7, 7, 4, 0]
     ]
     ```

From these examples, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- The output grid is a 2D array where each element is determined by the maximum value in a 2x2 sub-grid of the input.
- The output grid is smaller than the input grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.
- The transformation involves taking the maximum value from each 2x2 block of the input grid and placing it in the corresponding position in the output grid.

</reasoning>

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Input:
```
[
[3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5]
]
```

Applying the transformation rule:
- Divide the input grid into 2x2 sub-grids and take the maximum value from each sub-grid.

Output:
```
[
[3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],

```

The output grid is:
```

The transformation rule appears to involve reducing the size of the grid while preserving the central part of the input grid. The output grid is smaller and seems to be a cropped version of the input grid, focusing on the central region. The border of the input grid is removed, and the remaining central part is retained in the output grid.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: A 23x27 grid with a central region of 3s and 2s.
   - Output: A 5x5 grid focusing on the central part of the input grid.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: A 23x25 grid with a central region of 6s.
   - Output: A 3x3 grid focusing on the central part of the input grid.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: A 22x22 grid with a central region of 8s, 2s, and 1s.
   - Output: A 7x7 grid focusing on the central part of the input grid.

From these examples, we can infer that the transformation rule involves:
1. Identifying the central region of the input grid.
2. Removing the border rows and columns.
3. Retaining the central part in the output grid.

For the test case, we need to identify the central region and remove the border rows and columns to get the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve copying the value from the leftmost column of each row to the rightmost column of the same row. This is evident in all the examples provided. Specifically, the value in the first column of each row is mirrored to the last column of the same row. Additionally, the value in the second column of each row is mirrored to the second last column of the same row. This pattern holds for all rows in the grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case to see if it holds true.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding certain colored regions (represented by non-zero integers) outward by one cell in all directions. Specifically, if a cell contains a non-zero value, it will ""spread"" to its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) in the output grid. This spreading only occurs if the neighboring cell in the input grid is zero. Additionally, the spreading does not change the value of the original cell; it only affects the neighboring cells.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:
1. Identify all non-zero cells in the input grid.
2. For each non-zero cell, check its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right).
3. If a neighboring cell is zero, change it to the value of the non-zero cell in the output grid.
4. The original non-zero cells remain unchanged in the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve extracting specific values from the input grid and arranging them into a smaller output grid. The values seem to be taken from specific positions in the input grid, particularly from the bottom-right corner of the input grid. The output grid is a 3x3 or 4x4 grid, depending on the example.

Let's analyze the examples:

- **Example 1**: The output grid is 3x3. The values in the output grid are taken from the bottom-right corner of the input grid, specifically from the positions (18, 18), (18, 19), (18, 20), (19, 18), (19, 19), (19, 20), (20, 18), (20, 19), and (20, 20).

- **Example 2**: The output grid is 3x3. The values in the output grid are taken from the bottom-right corner of the input grid, specifically from the positions (18, 18), (18, 19), (18, 20), (19, 18), (19, 19), (19, 20), (20, 18), (20, 19), and (20, 20).

- **Example 3**: The output grid is 4x4. The values in the output grid are taken from the bottom-right corner of the input grid, specifically from the positions (18, 18), (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 21), (19, 18), (19, 19), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 18), (20, 19), (20, 20), (20, 21), (21, 18), (21, 19), (21, 20), and (21, 21).

Based on this pattern, the transformation rule seems to be:
1. Identify the bottom-right corner of the input grid.
2. Extract the values from this corner in a specific pattern.
3. Arrange these values into a smaller output grid.

For the test case, the input grid is 22x24. The bottom-right corner values are:
- (18, 18): 4
- (18, 19): 8
- (18, 20): 6
- (18, 21): 3
- (19, 18): 0
- (19, 19): 0
- (19, 20): 0
- (19, 21): 0
- (20, 18): 0
- (20, 19): 0
- (20, 20): 0
- (20, 21): 0
- (21, 18): 0
- (21, 19): 0
- (21, 20): 0
- (21, 21): 0

The output grid should be 4x4, arranged as follows:
```
[4, 8, 6, 3]

[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [1, 2],
     [3, 8]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [0, 1, 2, 0],
     [1, 1, 2, 2],
     [3, 3, 8, 8],
     [0, 3, 8, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output grid is a 2x2 grid expanded to a 4x4 grid. Each element in the input grid is repeated and surrounded by zeros.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [1, 8, 4],
     [8, 3, 8]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [0, 1, 8, 4, 0],
     [1, 1, 8, 4, 4],
     [8, 8, 3, 8, 8],
     [0, 8, 3, 8, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output grid is a 2x3 grid expanded to a 4x5 grid. Each element in the input grid is repeated and surrounded by zeros.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [2, 1, 4],
     [8, 0, 2],
     [3, 2, 8]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [0, 2, 1, 4, 0],
     [2, 2, 1, 4, 4],
     [8, 8, 0, 2, 2],
     [3, 3, 2, 8, 8],
     [0, 3, 2, 8, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output grid is a 3x3 grid expanded to a 5x5 grid. Each element in the input grid is repeated and surrounded by zeros.

From these observations, we can infer the transformation rule:
- The input grid is expanded by adding an extra row and column of zeros around it.
- Each element in the input grid is repeated to fill the corresponding 2x2 sub-grid in the output grid.

</reasoning>

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```
[
[2, 8],
[1, 4],
[3, 4]
]
```

Applying the transformation rule:
1. Add an extra row and column of zeros around the input grid.
2. Repeat each element to fill the corresponding 2x2 sub-grid in the output grid.

Output:
```
[
[0, 2, 8, 0, 0],
[2, 2, 8, 8, 0],
[1, 1, 4, 4, 0],
[3, 3, 4, 4, 0],
[0, 3, 4, 0, 0]
]
```

Answer: ``` [

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has a pattern with '3' as the background and other numbers scattered.
   - The output grid is a 5x5 grid with specific values at certain positions.
   - The transformation seems to focus on specific rows and columns, extracting certain values and rearranging them.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has a pattern with '1' as the background and '8' and '3' scattered.
   - The output grid is a 3x3 grid with specific values at certain positions.
   - The transformation again focuses on specific rows and columns, extracting certain values and rearranging them.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid has a pattern with '4' as the background and '1' and '7' scattered.
   - The output grid is a 5x5 grid with specific values at certain positions.
   - The transformation focuses on specific rows and columns, extracting certain values and rearranging them.

From these observations, it appears that the transformation rule involves:
- Identifying specific rows and columns that contain non-background values.
- Extracting these values and rearranging them into a smaller grid.
- The background value in the input grid seems to be ignored in the output grid.

For the test case, we need to identify the specific rows and columns that contain non-background values and rearrange them into a smaller grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in certain patterns around the non-zero values in the input grid. Specifically, the rule seems to be:

1. For each non-zero value in the input grid, place a '4' in the same row and column positions in the output grid.
2. The '4' values are placed in a diagonal pattern extending from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid.
3. The non-zero value itself is placed in the output grid at its original position.
4. The rest of the grid remains '0'.

This pattern is consistent across all the provided examples. For instance, in Example 1, the '2' in the input grid results in '4' values in the same row and column in the output grid. In Example 2 and Example 3, the '6' and '9' values respectively, result in '4' values in the same row and column in the output grid, with the non-zero value remaining in its original position.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying contiguous blocks of a specific color (represented by a specific integer) and then reducing the grid to a smaller grid where each cell represents the presence of that color block. The output grid seems to be a simplified representation of the input grid, focusing on the presence of the dominant color blocks.

From the examples:
- Example 1: The input grid has a dominant block of 7s in the middle, and the output grid is a 2x2 grid of 3s, suggesting that the surrounding 3s are the dominant color in the output.
- Example 2: The input grid has a dominant block of 8s in the middle, and the output grid is a 3x2 grid of 1s, suggesting that the surrounding 1s are the dominant color in the output.
- Example 3: The input grid has a dominant block of 1s in the middle, and the output grid is a 6x5 grid of 3s, suggesting that the surrounding 3s are the dominant color in the output.

The transformation rule seems to be:
1. Identify the dominant color block in the input grid.
2. Create an output grid where each cell represents the presence of the dominant color block.
3. The size of the output grid is determined by the dimensions of the dominant color block.

For the test case, the dominant color block is 5s, and the surrounding color is 1s. The output grid should be a simplified representation of the input grid, focusing on the presence of the 5s.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing each non-zero integer in the input grid with a new integer value that is derived from the maximum value in the input grid. Specifically, the transformation seems to replace each non-zero integer with the maximum value found in the input grid, but only for the rows and columns that contain that maximum value.

In Example 1, the maximum value is 2, and in Example 2, the maximum value is 3. The transformation replaces all instances of these maximum values with a new value that is the maximum value plus 2. This new value is then used to fill in the corresponding positions in the output grid.

For the test case, the maximum value is 8. Following the same rule, we should replace all instances of 8 with 10 (8 + 2) in the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve removing every other square in a pattern that alternates between rows and columns. Specifically, for each contiguous block of the same color, the transformation removes every other square in a checkerboard pattern. This pattern starts from the top-left corner and alternates between rows and columns.

Let's break down the examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The block of 8s in the top-left corner is transformed by removing every other square in a checkerboard pattern.
   - The block of 3s in the middle is transformed similarly.
   - The block of 6s and 7s at the bottom is also transformed in the same manner.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The block of 2s is transformed by removing every other square in a checkerboard pattern.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The block of 5s is transformed by removing every other square in a checkerboard pattern.
   - The block of 4s is transformed similarly.

Given this pattern, we can apply the same transformation to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values with specific patterns based on their positions relative to other values. Specifically, the transformation seems to depend on the presence of a particular color (represented by a number) and its proximity to other colors.

From the examples provided:
1. In Example 1, the color 8 is transformed into a pattern where it is surrounded by 3s and 4s, with 4s appearing in specific positions.
2. In Example 2, the color 1 is transformed into a pattern where it is surrounded by 3s and 4s, with 4s appearing in specific positions.
3. In Example 3, the color 9 is transformed into a pattern where it is surrounded by 4s and 3s, with 3s appearing in specific positions.

The transformation rule seems to be:
- If a cell contains the color 8, it is replaced by 8.
- If a cell contains the color 1, it is replaced by 1.
- If a cell contains the color 9, it is replaced by 9.
- If a cell is adjacent to a cell containing the color 8, 1, or 9, it is replaced by 4.
- If a cell is not adjacent to a cell containing the color 8, 1, or 9, it is replaced by 3.

Additionally, there are specific patterns that seem to be applied based on the position of the color in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are surrounded by 3s and 4s in a specific pattern. In Example 2, the 1s are surrounded by 3s and 4s in a specific pattern. In Example 3, the 9s are surrounded by 4s and 3s in a specific pattern.

Given these observations, we can apply the transformation rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Input Grid Analysis**:
   - The input grids are 11x11 matrices.
   - The grids contain values from 0 to 8, with 8 being the most frequent value, often forming a central horizontal line or a vertical line.

2. **Output Grid Analysis**:
   - The output grids are 3x3 matrices.
   - The values in the output grids are either 0 or 1.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The output grids seem to represent a simplified version of the input grids, focusing on specific positions.
   - The central row and column of the input grid (5th row and 5th column) appear to be crucial.
   - The output grid's values seem to be determined by the presence of specific values (likely 6 and 8) in the input grid.

4. **Hypothesis**:
   - The transformation rule likely involves checking specific positions in the input grid and mapping them to the output grid.
   - The presence of the value 6 in the input grid might correspond to a 1 in the output grid, while the absence of 6 might correspond to a 0.
   - The value 8 might also play a role, but it seems to be more of a background or separator.

5. **Detailed Rule**:
   - Check the 5th row and 5th column of the input grid.
   - If a 6 is present in these positions, map it to 1 in the corresponding position in the output grid.
   - If a 6 is not present, map it to 0.

2. If a cell with value 5 is adjacent to a cell with value 0 (horizontally or vertically), it changes to 2.

Applying the transformation rule:
- The `3` in the first row, first column is adjacent to a `0`, so it remains `3`.
- The `3` in the first row, third column is adjacent to a `0`, so it remains `3`.
- The `3` in the first row, fifth column is adjacent to a `0`, so it remains `3`.
- The `3` in the second row, first column is adjacent to a `0`, so it remains `3`.
- The `3` in the second row, second column is adjacent to a `0`, so it remains `3`.
- The `3` in the second row, third column is adjacent to a `0`, so it remains `3`.
- The `3` in the third row, fifth column is adjacent to a `0`, so it remains `3`.
- The `3` in the fourth row, second column is adjacent to a `0`, so it remains `3`.
- The `3` in the fourth row, third column is adjacent to a `0`, so it remains `3`.
- The `3` in the fifth row, second column is adjacent to a `0`, so it remains `3`.
- The `3` in the fifth row, third column is adjacent to a `0`, so it remains `3`.

Therefore, the output is:

The transformation rule appears to involve duplicating each row of the input grid and appending it to itself. This means that for each row in the input grid, the corresponding row in the output grid will have the same values repeated twice.

Let's analyze the examples to confirm this pattern:

- Example 1:
  - Input: [[0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 2], [0, 0, 0]]
  - Output: [[0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  - Each row is duplicated.

- Example 2:
  - Input: [[3, 0, 0], [2, 3, 0], [2, 1, 8], [0, 1, 0]]
  - Output: [[3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [2, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0], [2, 1, 8, 2, 1, 8], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]]
  - Each row is duplicated.

- Example 3:
  - Input: [[5, 2, 3, 0], [2, 5, 3, 0], [5, 2, 8, 8], [0, 0, 6, 0]]
  - Output: [[5, 2, 3, 0, 5, 2, 3, 0], [2, 5, 3, 0, 2, 5, 3, 0], [5, 2, 8, 8, 5, 2, 8, 8], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]]
  - Each row is duplicated.

Based on this pattern, the transformation rule is to duplicate each row and append it to itself.

From these examples, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- The output grid is a 3x3 sub-grid of the input grid.
- The transformation seems to focus on the central column of the input grid.
- The value 1 in the input grid is transformed to 8 in the output grid.
- The value 9 in the input grid is transformed to 0 in the output grid.
- The value 0 in the input grid is transformed to 0 in the output grid.

Given this rule, let's apply it to the test case.

Test Case Input:
```
[
[9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0],
[0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0],

[9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 0, 9],
[0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 9, 9]
]
```

Applying the transformation rule:
- The central column of the input grid is `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`.
- Transforming this column:
  - 0 -> 0
  - 1 -> 8
  - 0 -> 0
  - 1 -> 8
  - 0 -> 0

The output grid is:

- Output:
  ```
  [
  [6, 8, 3],
  [8, 7, 8],
  [5, 5, 2]
  ]
  ```

Observations:
1. The transformation seems to involve changing some values to 8.
2. The value 5 in the input is often transformed to 8 in the output.
3. The transformation does not affect all 5s, but seems to depend on the surrounding values.

Hypothesis:
The transformation rule appears to be:
- If a value is 5 and it is surrounded by values that are not 5, it is transformed to 8.
- If a value is 5 and it is surrounded by values that are 5, it remains 5.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

Test Case Input:

[
[8, 8, 4, 5],
[3, 8, 7, 5],
[3, 7, 1, 9],

```

Applying the transformation rule:
- The value 5 at (0, 3) is surrounded by 8 and 4, so it remains 5.
- The value 5 at (1, 3) is surrounded by 7 and 8, so it is transformed to 8.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain colors (integer values) with a specific color based on their position relative to the central row (the row filled with 5s). Here's the observed pattern:

1. For rows above the central row, the colors are replaced with the color of the first non-5 value in the row, or 0 if the row is entirely 5s.
2. For rows below the central row, the colors are replaced with the color of the first non-5 value in the row, or 0 if the row is entirely 5s.
3. The central row remains unchanged.
4. The transformation seems to propagate the first non-5 color to the entire row, except for the central row which remains unchanged.

The transformation rule appears to involve two main steps:

1. **Horizontal Duplication**: Each row in the input grid is duplicated and placed side by side to form the first part of the output grid. This duplication seems to be based on the last column of the input grid.

2. **Vertical Duplication**: The resulting grid from step 1 is then duplicated vertically to form the final output grid. This duplication seems to be based on the last row of the input grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:

1. **Horizontal Duplication**:
   - For the first row: [7, 7, 3, 2, 2] becomes [7, 7, 3, 2, 2, 7, 7, 3, 2, 2]
   - For the second row: [7, 7, 3, 2, 2] becomes [7, 7, 3, 2, 2, 7, 7, 3, 2, 2]
   - For the third row: [3, 3, 3, 2, 2] becomes [3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]
   - For the fourth row: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] becomes [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
   - For the fifth row: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] becomes [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

2. **Vertical Duplication**:
   - The resulting grid from step 1 is duplicated vertically to form the final output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the value of certain cells based on their position and the values of their neighbors. Specifically, the rule seems to be:

1. If a cell contains a '1' and is surrounded by other '1's in a specific pattern (e.g., a 3x3 square), it is transformed into a '3'.
2. If a cell contains a '1' and is not surrounded by other '1's in the specific pattern, it remains a '1'.
3. Cells containing '0' remain '0'.

By observing the examples, we can see that the transformation is applied to groups of '1's that form specific shapes, such as squares or rectangles. The transformation does not affect isolated '1's or '1's that are not part of these shapes.

For the test case, we need to identify the groups of '1's that form the specific shapes and transform them into '3's while leaving the rest of the grid unchanged.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values in the input grid with different values based on their position and the values of their neighboring cells. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve:
1. Replacing the value `1` with `2` if it is surrounded by `1`s.
2. Replacing the value `3` with `4` if it is surrounded by `3`s.
3. Replacing the value `4` with `5` if it is surrounded by `4`s.
4. Replacing the value `5` with `6` if it is surrounded by `5`s.
5. Replacing the value `6` with `4` if it is surrounded by `6`s.
6. Replacing the value `2` with `3` if it is surrounded by `2`s.
7. Replacing the value `8` with `5` if it is surrounded by `8`s.

Additionally, there are specific transformations for certain patterns:
- If a `1` is surrounded by `1`s and a `2` is next to it, it becomes `3`.
- If a `3` is surrounded by `3`s and a `4` is next to it, it becomes `5`.
- If a `4` is surrounded by `4`s and a `5` is next to it, it becomes `6`.
- If a `5` is surrounded by `5`s and a `6` is next to it, it becomes `4`.
- If a `6` is surrounded by `6`s and a `4` is next to it, it becomes `5`.

These transformations are applied iteratively until no more changes can be made.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid is 16x16.
   - The output grid is 5x5.
   - The output grid seems to be a reduced version of the input grid, focusing on specific regions.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid is 16x16.
   - The output grid is 5x5.
   - Similar to Example 1, the output grid is a reduced version of the input grid.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid is 16x16.
   - The output grid is 5x5.
   - Again, the output grid is a reduced version of the input grid.

From these observations, it appears that the transformation rule involves reducing the 16x16 grid to a 5x5 grid. The reduction seems to focus on specific regions of the input grid. Let's hypothesize that the transformation involves taking specific cells from the input grid and mapping them to the output grid.

To confirm this, let's map the cells from the input to the output for each example:

- **Example 1**:
  - The output grid seems to be derived from the central region of the input grid, specifically focusing on the middle 5x5 section.

- **Example 2**:
  - Similar to Example 1, the output grid is derived from the central region of the input grid.

- **Example 3**:
  - The output grid is derived from the central region of the input grid.

Given this pattern, the transformation rule likely involves taking the central 5x5 section of the input grid and mapping it directly to the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve removing duplicate rows from the input grid to produce the output grid. In each example, the output grid contains only unique rows from the input grid, and the order of the rows is preserved.

Let's analyze the examples:

- Example 1: The input grid has rows [1, 1, 3, 2], [1, 1, 3, 3], [3, 3, 1, 1], and [2, 3, 1, 1]. The output grid contains these rows in the same order, but without duplicates.
- Example 2: The input grid has rows [4, 4, 4], [6, 4, 8], and [6, 6, 8]. The output grid contains these rows in the same order, but without duplicates.
- Example 3: The input grid has rows [2, 3], [3, 2], and [4, 4]. The output grid contains these rows in the same order, but without duplicates.

Based on this pattern, the transformation rule is to remove duplicate rows from the input grid while preserving the order of the first occurrence of each row.

1. **Top-left to bottom-right diagonal**: The values on this diagonal are transformed to '1' if they are '0' and not on the main diagonal.
2. **Bottom-left to top-right diagonal**: The values on this diagonal are transformed to '3' if they are '0' and not on the main diagonal.
3. **Main diagonal**: The values on the main diagonal remain unchanged.
4. **Values adjacent to '5'**: The values adjacent to '5' are transformed to '2' if they are '0'.

- In Example 2, the input has an 8 in the top row, second column. The output has a 2 in the second row, second column, shifted down by one row.
- In Example 3, the input has 8s in the second row. The output has 2s in the third row, shifted down by one row.

The transformation rule appears to involve duplicating the input grid and then stacking these duplicates in a specific pattern. Let's break down the observed patterns:

1. The output grid is always larger than the input grid.
2. The output grid seems to be constructed by stacking multiple copies of the input grid, with each copy shifted down and to the right.
3. The number of rows in the output grid is determined by the number of rows in the input grid plus the number of rows in the input grid minus one.
4. The number of columns in the output grid is determined by the number of columns in the input grid plus the number of columns in the input grid minus one.

For Example 1:
- Input grid has 3 rows and 17 columns.
- Output grid has 9 rows and 17 columns.
- The pattern of stacking involves duplicating the input grid and shifting it down and to the right.

For Example 2:
- Input grid has 4 rows and 17 columns.
- Output grid has 13 rows and 17 columns.
- The pattern of stacking involves duplicating the input grid and shifting it down and to the right.

Given these observations, we can apply the same transformation rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve the introduction of a new color (represented by the integer 8) in specific locations. The rule seems to be:
1. Identify the boundary between two different colors.
2. Introduce the color 8 in the row directly below the boundary, spanning the width of the lower color.
3. This transformation only occurs when there is a clear boundary between two different colors in adjacent rows.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting the position of the '1' in each row of the input grid to create a pattern in the output grid. Specifically, the '1' in the input grid seems to determine the position of the '1' in the output grid, and the rest of the grid is filled with alternating '0's and '1's in a diagonal pattern.

For example, in Example 1, the '1' is in the last row, first column of the input grid. In the output grid, the '1's are placed in a diagonal pattern starting from the first row, second column.

In Example 2, the '1' is in the last row, first column of the input grid. In the output grid, the '1's are placed in a diagonal pattern starting from the first row, third column.

In Example 3, the '1' is in the last row, first column of the input grid. In the output grid, the '1's are placed in a diagonal pattern starting from the first row, fourth column.

Therefore, the transformation rule seems to be:
1. Identify the position of the '1' in the input grid.
2. Place a '1' in the output grid starting from the first row, and shift it to the right by the column index of the '1' in the input grid.
3. Fill the rest of the grid with alternating '0's and '1's in a diagonal pattern.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the top-left corner of the largest contiguous block of the color represented by the number 8, and then creating a 3x3 output grid based on this position. The output grid is filled with the number 8 in the top-left corner if the top-left corner of the 8-block is within the top-left quadrant of the input grid. The output grid is filled with the number 0 in the top-left corner if the top-left corner of the 8-block is within the bottom-right quadrant of the input grid. The output grid is filled with the number 0 in the top-left corner if the top-left corner of the 8-block is within the bottom-left quadrant of the input grid. The output grid is filled with the number 0 in the top-left corner if the top-left corner of the 8-block is within the top-right quadrant of the input grid.

Let's analyze the examples:

- Example 1: The top-left corner of the 8-block is at (4, 3). The output is a 3x3 grid with 8s in the top-left corner.
- Example 2: The top-left corner of the 8-block is at (5, 2). The output is a 3x3 grid with 8s in the top-left corner and the middle of the first row.
- Example 3: The top-left corner of the 8-block is at (5, 2). The output is a 3x3 grid with 8s in the top-left corner.
- Example 4: The top-left corner of the 8-block is at (4, 2). The output is a 3x3 grid with 8s in the top-left corner and the middle of the first row.
- Example 5: The top-left corner of the 8-block is at (2, 2). The output is a 3x3 grid with 8s in the top-left corner and the middle of the first row.
- Example 6: The top-left corner of the 8-block is at (4, 2). The output is a 3x3 grid with 8s in the top-left corner and the middle of the first row.

For the test case, the top-left corner of the 8-block is at (2, 2). Therefore, the output should be a 3x3 grid with 8s in the top-left corner and the middle of the first row.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding each cell in the input grid into a 2x2 block in the output grid. Each cell's value is replicated to fill its corresponding 2x2 block. Additionally, the output grid seems to maintain the same height-to-width ratio as the input grid, with the width being doubled.

Let's break down the transformation rule:
1. Each cell in the input grid is transformed into a 2x2 block in the output grid.
2. The value of each cell is replicated to fill its corresponding 2x2 block.
3. The output grid's dimensions are doubled in width compared to the input grid.

For example, in Example 1:
- The input cell (0,0) with value 0 becomes a 2x2 block of 0s in the output grid.
- The input cell (0,1) with value 5 becomes a 2x2 block of 5s in the output grid.
- The input cell (0,2) with value 1 becomes a 2x2 block of 1s in the output grid.
- And so on for the rest of the grid.

This rule is consistent across all provided examples.

The transformation rule appears to involve spreading a specific color (represented by the number 2) horizontally and vertically from its initial position. The color 2 spreads to the right and downwards, filling the grid with a new color (represented by the number 8) until it encounters another color or the edge of the grid. The color 3, however, does not spread and remains in its original position.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
1. Identify the positions of the number 2 and 3 in the input grid.
2. Spread the number 2 to the right and downwards, filling the grid with the number 8 until it encounters another color or the edge of the grid.
3. Leave the number 3 in its original position.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting and/or rotating the input grid to produce the output grid. Specifically, the output grid seems to be constructed by stacking multiple transformations of the input grid. Let's analyze the examples:

- **Example 1**: The output grid is created by stacking the input grid and its 180-degree rotation.
- **Example 2**: The output grid is created by stacking the input grid and its 180-degree rotation.
- **Example 3**: The output grid is created by stacking the input grid and its 180-degree rotation.
- **Example 4**: The output grid is created by stacking the input grid and its 180-degree rotation.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in gaps between colored squares (non-zero values) with the same color. Specifically, if there is a gap of zeros between two identical non-zero values, the gap is filled with that same non-zero value. Additionally, if a non-zero value is surrounded by zeros on all sides, it expands outward to fill the surrounding zeros.

Let's break down the examples:

1. In Example 1, the '2' values in the bottom right corner expand to fill the surrounding zeros.
2. In Example 2, the '1' values in the middle expand to fill the surrounding zeros.
3. In Example 3, the '1' values at the top expand to fill the surrounding zeros, and the '2' values at the bottom expand to fill the surrounding zeros.

Given this rule, we can apply it to the test case to determine the output.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the value of certain cells based on the presence of specific patterns in the input grid. Specifically, when a cell with a value of 1 is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to another cell with a value of 1, the value of the cell changes to 2. This transformation seems to apply to all such pairs of adjacent 1s in the grid.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In Example 1, the input grid has pairs of adjacent 1s at (0,0) and (0,2), and (3,2) and (3,4). These pairs are transformed to 2 in the output grid.
- In Example 2, the input grid has pairs of adjacent 1s in the second row, and these pairs are transformed to 2 in the output grid.
- In Example 3, the input grid has pairs of adjacent 1s in the second row, third row, sixth row, and ninth row, and these pairs are transformed to 2 in the output grid.

Based on this pattern, we can infer that the transformation rule is to change the value of a cell to 2 if it is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to another cell with a value of 1.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in gaps between non-zero values to create contiguous blocks of the same color. Specifically, if there is a non-zero value surrounded by zeros, the transformation fills in the zeros to create a contiguous block of the same color.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In Example 1, the input has several disconnected blocks of the color represented by 6. The output fills in the gaps to create contiguous blocks.
- In Example 2, the input has disconnected blocks of colors 2 and 3. The output fills in the gaps to create contiguous blocks.

The transformation seems to be filling in the gaps between non-zero values to create contiguous blocks of the same color. This means that if a non-zero value is surrounded by zeros, the transformation will fill in the zeros to create a contiguous block of the same color.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input has a '2' at (3,2) and a '1' at (6,6).
   - The output has '4' values surrounding the '2' and '1', and '7' values surrounding the '1'.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input has an '8' at (0,3), a '2' at (2,6) and (7,0), and a '1' at (3,2) and (6,6).
   - The output has '4' values surrounding the '2' and '1', and '7' values surrounding the '1' and '8'.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input has a '2' at (2,2), a '6' at (5,6), and a '1' at (7,3).
   - The output has '4' values surrounding the '2' and '1', and '7' values surrounding the '1' and '6'.

From these observations, we can infer the following rules:
- For each non-zero value in the input grid, place '4' values in the cells directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of the non-zero value in the output grid.
- For each '1' in the input grid, place '7' values in the cells directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of the '1' in the output grid.
- For each '8' in the input grid, place '7' values in the cells directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of the '8' in the output grid.

Applying the rules:
- For '2' at (3,2) and (7,7), place '4' values around them.
- For '1' at (2,6), place '7' values around it.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has several distinct colored regions.
   - The output grid seems to be a compressed version of the input grid, focusing on the boundaries and significant features of the colored regions.
   - The output grid is smaller and seems to highlight the edges and transitions between different colors.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Similar to Example 1, the output grid is a compressed version of the input grid.
   - The output grid highlights the boundaries and significant features of the colored regions.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Again, the output grid is a compressed version of the input grid.
   - The output grid highlights the boundaries and significant features of the colored regions.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves compressing the input grid while preserving the boundaries and significant features of the colored regions. The output grid is smaller and focuses on the edges and transitions between different colors.

To apply this rule to the test case, we need to identify the boundaries and significant features of the colored regions in the input grid and then compress them into a smaller grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the value of certain cells based on the values of their neighbors. Specifically, it seems that if a cell has a value of 2 and is surrounded by cells with a value of 0, it changes to 4. This transformation is applied to the entire grid, and the pattern seems to propagate outward from the initial 2s.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In Example 1, the 2s in the input grid that are surrounded by 0s are changed to 4s in the output grid.
- In Example 2 and Example 3, the same pattern is observed, with 2s surrounded by 0s being changed to 4s.

The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
1. If a cell has a value of 2 and is surrounded by cells with a value of 0, change it to 4.
2. This transformation is applied to the entire grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting the input grid across the horizontal axis (i.e., flipping it vertically) and then appending the reflected grid to the bottom of the original grid. This is evident from the examples provided:

- In Example 1, the input grid is reflected and appended to itself, resulting in a larger grid where the bottom half is a mirror image of the top half.
- In Example 2, the input grid is reflected and appended, but since the input grid is already symmetric, the output is simply the input grid repeated.
- In Example 3, the input grid is reflected and appended, resulting in a larger grid where the bottom half is a mirror image of the top half.

Given this pattern, the test case should be transformed by reflecting the input grid vertically and appending the reflected grid to the bottom of the original grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling the grid with a pattern of 3s and 0s. The pattern seems to be a diagonal line of 0s starting from the top-left corner and ending at the bottom-right corner, with the rest of the grid filled with 3s. The diagonal line of 0s is one cell wide and shifts one cell to the right for each row.

Let's break down the pattern:
1. The first row is entirely filled with 3s.
2. The second row has a 0 in the first column and 3s elsewhere.
3. The third row has 0s in the first two columns and 3s elsewhere.
4. This pattern continues, with each subsequent row having one more 0 at the start and shifting the diagonal line of 0s one cell to the right.

The pattern also seems to depend on the dimensions of the grid. For example, in a 6x6 grid, the diagonal line of 0s ends at the bottom-right corner. In larger grids, the pattern continues until the diagonal line of 0s reaches the bottom-right corner.

Given this pattern, we can apply it to the test case, which is an 18x18 grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain colors (represented by integers) with other colors based on their position relative to other colors in the grid. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve:
1. Replacing '0' with '3' if it is adjacent to '9' either horizontally or vertically.
2. Replacing '9' with '1' if it is adjacent to '0' either horizontally or vertically.
3. The transformation also seems to involve filling in certain areas with '3' or '1' based on the presence of '9' in the vicinity.

Let's apply these rules to the test case to determine the output.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain '1's with '2's based on specific conditions. Observing the examples, we can see that '1's are replaced with '2's when they are adjacent to a '2' in the input grid. Specifically, a '1' is transformed into a '2' if it is directly above, below, to the left, or to the right of a '2'. Additionally, the transformation seems to propagate from the '2's outward, affecting '1's that are adjacent to already transformed '2's.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:
1. Identify all '2's in the input grid.
2. Replace '1's that are adjacent to any '2' with '2's.
3. Continue this process iteratively until no more '1's can be replaced.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting the non-zero values in the input grid to the left and up, while filling the vacated spaces with zeros. Specifically, for each row, the non-zero values are moved to the left until they hit the boundary or another non-zero value. Similarly, for each column, the non-zero values are moved up until they hit the boundary or another non-zero value. This transformation seems to be applied independently to each color block.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:
1. Identify the non-zero values in each row and move them to the left.
2. Identify the non-zero values in each column and move them up.
3. Fill the vacated spaces with zeros.

The transformation rule appears to involve the propagation of a specific color (represented by the integer 8) in a diagonal manner. When an 8 is present in the input grid, it seems to influence the surrounding cells in a specific pattern, turning them into the color represented by the integer 3. This pattern appears to be a diagonal spread from the position of the 8.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the 8 at (10, 3) and (11, 2) influences the cells diagonally around it, turning them into 3s.
2. In Example 2, the 8s at (2, 0), (3, 1), and (4, 2) influence the cells diagonally around them, turning them into 3s.
3. In Example 3, the 8s at (9, 6), (10, 7), and (11, 8) influence the cells diagonally around them, turning them into 3s.

The pattern seems to be that the 8 spreads diagonally in a specific manner, turning the cells into 3s. The spread appears to be in a cross-like pattern centered on the 8.

Given this pattern, we can apply the same rule to the test case.

   - Observation: Similar to Example 1, the output grid is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid, with zeros filling in the empty spaces.

3. **Example 3:**

     ]
     ```
   - Observation: Again, the output grid is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid, with zeros filling in the empty spaces.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
1. Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2. Fill any empty spaces (created by the rotation) with zeros.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing each non-5 value in the input grid with a specific value based on its position relative to the '5' values. Specifically, each '5' in the input grid seems to act as a pivot, and the values around it are transformed into a sequence of numbers that increase or decrease based on their distance from the '5'.

From the examples, we can observe the following patterns:
- Values to the left of a '5' are replaced by a sequence starting from 6 and increasing by 1 as we move left.
- Values to the right of a '5' are replaced by a sequence starting from 7 and increasing by 1 as we move right.
- Values above a '5' are replaced by a sequence starting from 6 and increasing by 1 as we move up.
- Values below a '5' are replaced by a sequence starting from 7 and increasing by 1 as we move down.

Additionally, the '5' values themselves remain unchanged.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve propagating the color 8 in a specific pattern. Let's analyze the examples:

1. **Example 1**: The color 8 propagates to the right and downwards, filling in the grid in a diagonal pattern.
2. **Example 2**: Similar propagation of color 8, but in a different starting configuration.
3. **Example 3**: The color 8 propagates in a more complex pattern, but still follows a diagonal and vertical propagation.

The key observation is that the color 8 seems to propagate diagonally and vertically from its initial positions. The color 2 does not propagate and remains in its original position.

Given this, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- Propagate the color 8 diagonally downwards and to the right.
- The color 2 remains in its original position and does not propagate.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain sequences of zeros with the number 6. Specifically, the rule seems to be:
- If a sequence of zeros is surrounded by non-zero values (or the edge of the grid), replace the sequence with the number 6.

Let's analyze the examples to confirm this rule:

- In Example 1, the sequence of zeros in the second and third rows of the input is transformed into 6s in the output.
- In Example 2, the sequence of zeros in the fourth row of the input is transformed into 6s in the output.
- In Example 3, the sequence of zeros in the first row of the input is transformed into 6s in the output.
- In Example 4, the sequence of zeros in the fourth row of the input is transformed into 6s in the output.

Given this pattern, we can apply the same rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve several steps:

1. **Boundary Removal**: The output grid is smaller than the input grid, suggesting that the boundary rows and columns are removed. The number of rows and columns removed seems to depend on the specific example, but it's consistent within each example.

2. **Color Mapping**: The colors (integers) in the input grid are mapped to different colors in the output grid. This mapping is not one-to-one and seems to depend on the context of the surrounding colors.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: The output grid seems to preserve certain patterns or structures from the input grid, but with different colors.

4. **Symmetry and Alignment**: The output grid maintains a certain symmetry and alignment with the input grid, suggesting that the transformation rule respects the spatial relationships between colors.

For Example 1, the boundary rows and columns are removed, and the colors are mapped to a smaller grid. For Example 2, the boundary rows and columns are removed, and the colors are mapped to a smaller grid with a different pattern. For Example 3, the boundary rows and columns are removed, and the colors are mapped to a smaller grid with a different pattern.

Given these observations, let's apply the transformation rule to the test case.

From these examples, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- The output grid is a 3x3 grid.
- The value in the output grid is determined by the presence of the number '1' in the corresponding row of the input grid.
- If a '1' is present in the row, the corresponding value in the output grid is '2'.
- If a '1' is not present in the row, the corresponding value in the output grid is '0'.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting the colors (or numbers) in each row to the right, wrapping around to the leftmost column when necessary. Additionally, the transformation seems to involve filling in the zeros with the color (or number) that appears most frequently in the row.

Let's break down the transformation rule:
1. Shift each row to the right by one position, with the rightmost element wrapping around to the leftmost position.
2. Replace all zeros in the row with the most frequent non-zero number in that row.

By applying this rule to the test case, we can determine the output.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing specific values in the grid based on certain conditions. By examining the examples, we can infer the following:

1. **Preservation of Zeros**: Zeros (0) in the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
2. **Transformation of Non-Zero Values**: Non-zero values are transformed into a new value based on their position and the values around them. Specifically, non-zero values that are surrounded by zeros or are at the boundary of the grid are transformed into a new value (1 in the examples provided).
3. **Propagation of Transformation**: The transformation seems to propagate from the boundaries inward, affecting adjacent cells.

Given these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves checking the surrounding cells of each non-zero value and transforming it if it meets certain conditions.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in the grid with specific values based on the position of the non-zero values in the input grid. Specifically, the rule seems to be:

1. For each row in the input grid, starting from the top, fill in the corresponding row in the output grid with the value 3, starting from the leftmost non-zero value in the input row and moving to the right.
2. The number of 3s in each row corresponds to the number of non-zero values in the input row.
3. The value 2 in the input grid remains as 2 in the output grid.
4. The value 1 in the output grid appears to be a marker for the transition from 3s to 0s, and it seems to be placed one row below the last row containing 3s.
5. The value 0 in the output grid represents the absence of any non-zero values in the corresponding input row.

By observing the examples, we can see that the transformation rule is consistent across different input sizes and configurations.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the largest connected component of each color in the input grid and then creating a smaller grid where each cell represents the presence of that color's largest connected component. The output grid seems to be a 3x3 grid, where each cell indicates whether the corresponding largest connected component from the input grid is present in that position.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Identify the largest connected component for each color in the input grid.
2. Create a 3x3 output grid where each cell corresponds to the presence of the largest connected component of a specific color.
3. If the largest connected component of a color is present in the top-left, top-middle, top-right, middle-left, middle-middle, middle-right, bottom-left, bottom-middle, or bottom-right section of the input grid, mark the corresponding cell in the output grid with the color value.

For example, in Example 1, the largest connected component of color 3 is in the top-left section, and the largest connected component of color 4 is in the top-middle and bottom-middle sections. Therefore, the output grid has 4 in the top-middle and bottom-middle cells.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The input grids have a repeating pattern of 0s and 4s.
   - The output grids introduce the number 6 in specific positions.

2. **Position Analysis**:
   - In the output grids, the number 6 appears in positions that are not directly adjacent to another 6.
   - The 6s seem to be placed in a way that they are not adjacent to each other either horizontally or vertically.

3. **Rule Hypothesis**:
   - The transformation rule appears to be: Replace every second 4 in the input grid with a 6, ensuring that no two 6s are adjacent.

4. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify this rule with the given examples:
     - Example 1: The 6s are placed in positions that are not adjacent to each other.
     - Example 2: The 6s are placed in positions that are not adjacent to each other.
     - Example 3: The 6s are placed in positions that are not adjacent to each other.
     - Example 4: The 6s are placed in positions that are not adjacent to each other.
     - Example 5: The 6s are placed in positions that are not adjacent to each other.

Given this analysis, the rule seems to be consistent across all examples.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing specific values within the grid based on their surrounding values. Specifically, the rule seems to be:
- If a cell has the same value as its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right), it remains unchanged.
- If a cell has a different value than its immediate neighbors, it is changed to a specific value (8 in the examples provided).

Let's analyze the examples:
- In Example 1, the '2' values in the middle of the grid are changed to '8' when they are surrounded by '2' values.
- In Example 2, the '2' values in the middle of the grid are changed to '8' when they are surrounded by '2' values.
- In Example 3, the '2' values in the middle of the grid are changed to '8' when they are surrounded by '2' values.

The transformation rule seems to be that if a cell is surrounded by cells of the same value, it is changed to '8'. This rule applies to all values, not just '2'.

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has a central structure with the number 8 forming a cross-like shape.
   - The output grid has the numbers 6 and 2 placed symmetrically around the central structure.
   - The numbers 3 and 4 are placed in specific positions relative to the central structure.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has a central structure with the number 7 forming a cross-like shape.
   - The output grid has the numbers 3 and 9 placed symmetrically around the central structure.
   - The numbers 8 and 2 are placed in specific positions relative to the central structure.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid has a central structure with the number 1 forming a horizontal line.
   - The output grid has the numbers 3 and 6 placed symmetrically around the central structure.
   - The numbers 5 and 2 are placed in specific positions relative to the central structure.

From these observations, it seems that the transformation rule involves:
- Identifying a central structure (e.g., a cross or a line) within the input grid.
- Placing specific numbers symmetrically around this central structure.
- Placing additional numbers in specific positions relative to the central structure.

For the test case, the input grid has a central structure with the number 3 forming a cross-like shape. We need to place specific numbers symmetrically around this central structure and in specific positions relative to it.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding the input grid into a larger grid by replicating and shifting the original grid's rows and columns. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve the following steps:

1. **Initial Expansion**: The input grid is expanded by adding zeros to the right and below the original grid. The number of zeros added is equal to the number of rows (or columns) in the original grid minus one.

2. **Row and Column Replication**: The original rows and columns are replicated and shifted to fill in the expanded grid. The replication and shifting pattern seems to follow a specific order:
   - The first three rows of the output grid are the original rows of the input grid, followed by zeros.
   - The next three rows are the original rows of the input grid, shifted one position to the right, followed by zeros.
   - The last three rows are the original rows of the input grid, shifted two positions to the right, followed by zeros.

3. **Column Replication**: The columns are replicated in a similar manner, but shifted downwards.

By observing the examples, we can see that the transformation rule involves replicating the original grid's rows and columns and shifting them to fill in the expanded grid with zeros.

The transformation rule appears to involve rotating the grid around the central point where the non-zero value is located. The output grid is a 90-degree rotation of the input grid, with the non-zero value at the center of the rotation. The rotation is such that the non-zero value moves to the top-left corner of the output grid, and the rest of the grid is filled in accordingly.

Let's break down the examples:

1. In Example 1, the non-zero value (2) is in the center of the input grid. After rotation, it moves to the top-left corner of the output grid, and the rest of the grid is filled in a 90-degree rotated manner.
2. In Example 2, the non-zero value (7) is in the center of the input grid. After rotation, it moves to the top-left corner of the output grid, and the rest of the grid is filled in a 90-degree rotated manner.
3. In Example 3, the non-zero value (8) is in the center of the input grid. After rotation, it moves to the top-left corner of the output grid, and the rest of the grid is filled in a 90-degree rotated manner.

For the test case, the non-zero value (6) is located at (7, 12). We need to rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise around this point.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the value of certain cells based on their position relative to other cells of the same value. Specifically, if a cell contains a value `x` and it is not on the diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right), it is transformed into `x + 4`. If it is on the diagonal, it remains unchanged.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In Example 1, the value `2` in the middle of the grid is transformed to `4` because it is not on the diagonal.
- In Example 2, the values `9` that are not on the diagonal are transformed to `4`.
- In Example 3, the values `3` that are not on the diagonal are transformed to `4`.

Therefore, the rule seems to be: if a cell contains a value `x` and it is not on the diagonal, transform it to `x + 4`. If it is on the diagonal, leave it unchanged.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting the positions of the colored squares (non-zero values) in a specific pattern. Let's analyze the examples to identify the pattern:

1. In Example 1, the '1' values in the input are shifted to the left and up, and the '2' values are shifted to the right and down.
2. In Example 2, the '2' values are shifted to the left and up, and the '1' values are shifted to the right and down.
3. In Example 3, the '2' values are shifted to the left and up, and the '1' values are shifted to the right and down.

The pattern seems to be that each non-zero value is shifted diagonally to the top-left or bottom-right, depending on its position relative to the center of the grid. Specifically, values above and to the left of the center are shifted to the top-left, and values below and to the right of the center are shifted to the bottom-right.

For the test case, we need to apply this rule to the '1' and '2' values.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding the input grid into a larger grid while maintaining the relative positions of the colors. Specifically, the output grid is a 3x3 expansion of the input grid, with each cell in the input grid influencing a 3x3 block in the output grid. The center cell of each 3x3 block in the output grid corresponds to the cell in the input grid, and the surrounding cells in the 3x3 block are filled based on the values of the neighboring cells in the input grid.

For example, in Example 1, the input grid has a '7' in the center, and the output grid has a '7' in the center of the 3x3 block, with '0's surrounding it. The same pattern is observed in other examples, where the center cell of each 3x3 block in the output grid corresponds to the cell in the input grid, and the surrounding cells are filled based on the values of the neighboring cells in the input grid.

Additionally, the output grid seems to have a border of '0's around it, which is not present in the input grid. This border is likely added to maintain the 3x3 block structure at the edges of the grid.

Based on this observation, we can infer that the transformation rule involves expanding each cell in the input grid into a 3x3 block in the output grid, with the center cell of the block corresponding to the cell in the input grid, and the surrounding cells filled based on the values of the neighboring cells in the input grid. The output grid also has a border of '0's around it.

The transformation rule appears to involve several steps:

1. **Identify the Bounding Box**: The transformation seems to identify the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that encloses all the non-zero values in the input grid.
2. **Expand the Bounding Box**: The bounding box is then expanded by one unit in all directions (up, down, left, right).
3. **Fill the Bounding Box**: The expanded bounding box is filled with the same non-zero value that was present in the original grid.
4. **Resize the Grid**: The output grid is resized to fit the expanded bounding box.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- The input grid has non-zero values (4s) in a specific pattern.
- The bounding box that encloses all the 4s is identified.
- This bounding box is expanded by one unit in all directions.
- The expanded bounding box is filled with 4s.
- The output grid is resized to fit this expanded bounding box.

   - Observation: Again, the highest values in each column are moved to the top, and zeros fill in the remaining spaces.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [1, 1, 1],
     [2, 2, 1],
     [2, 8, 1],
     [2, 8, 1]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [1, 2, 8],
     [1, 2, 8],
     [1, 2, 0],
     [1, 2, 0],
     [1, 0, 0],
     [1, 0, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The pattern continues with the highest values in each column moving to the top, and zeros filling in the remaining spaces.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
1. Sort each column in descending order.
2. Fill the remaining spaces with zeros.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```
[
[8, 8, 2, 2],
[1, 8, 8, 2],
[1, 3, 3, 4],
[1, 1, 1, 1]
]
```

1. Sort each column in descending order:
   - Column 1: [8, 1, 1, 1]
   - Column 2: [8, 8, 3, 1]
   - Column 3: [8, 8, 3, 1]
   - Column 4: [4, 2, 2, 1]

2. Fill the remaining spaces with zeros:
   - Column 1: [8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
   - Column 2: [8, 8, 3, 1, 0, 0]
   - Column 3: [8, 8, 3, 1, 0, 0]

The transformation rule appears to involve moving certain colors (or values) from the bottom-right corner of the grid to the top-left corner. Specifically, the rule seems to be:

1. Identify the bottom-rightmost non-zero value in the grid.
2. Move this value to the top-left corner of the grid, shifting all other values to the right and down accordingly.
3. Repeat this process until the grid is transformed as shown in the examples.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding each cell in the input grid into a 3x3 block in the output grid. Each 3x3 block is filled with the value of the corresponding cell from the input grid. This means that each cell in the input grid is replicated into a 3x3 square in the output grid.

Let's break down the transformation rule:
1. Each cell in the input grid is transformed into a 3x3 block in the output grid.
2. The value of the cell in the input grid is replicated into all nine cells of the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid.

For example, in Example 1:
- The cell (0,0) in the input grid has the value 3. This value is replicated into a 3x3 block in the output grid starting at (0,0).
- The cell (1,1) in the input grid has the value 4. This value is replicated into a 3x3 block in the output grid starting at (3,3).

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

From these examples, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- If a cell has a value of 1 and is surrounded by at least one other cell with a value of 1, it is transformed to 2.
- If a cell has a value of 1 and is not surrounded by any other cell with a value of 1, it remains 1.
- If a cell has a value of 0, it remains 0.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the unique color (integer value) that is surrounded by a border of zeros and then outputting that color as a single-element list. Let's analyze the examples:

- **Example 1**: The input grid has a central block of color 6 surrounded by zeros. The output is `[6]`.
- **Example 2**: The input grid has a central block of color 5 surrounded by zeros. The output is `[5]`.
- **Example 3**: The input grid has a central block of color 2 surrounded by zeros. The output is `[2]`.

In each case, the output is the color that forms a distinct, bordered block within the grid. The transformation rule seems to be identifying the unique color that is completely surrounded by zeros and outputting that color.

For the test case, we need to identify the unique color that is surrounded by a border of zeros.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values with a new value, specifically the number 4. By examining the examples, we can see that the number 2 is consistently replaced with the number 4 in the output grids. This transformation seems to occur regardless of the surrounding values or the position of the number 2 in the grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve propagating the non-zero values (colors) from their initial positions in a specific pattern. Let's break down the observed patterns:

1. **Propagation Pattern**: Non-zero values seem to propagate diagonally and horizontally. For example, in Example 1, the value `1` at the top-left corner propagates diagonally down-right and horizontally to the right. Similarly, the value `2` at the top-right corner propagates diagonally down-left and horizontally to the left.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The propagation stops at the boundaries of the grid or when it encounters another non-zero value.

3. **Value Replacement**: When a non-zero value propagates, it replaces the zero values in its path. If it encounters another non-zero value, it does not overwrite it.

4. **Multiple Values**: When multiple non-zero values are present, they propagate independently and can intersect, creating a pattern where both values are present.

5. **Propagation Distance**: The propagation distance seems to be limited to a certain number of steps, which might be related to the size of the grid or the initial position of the non-zero values.

Given these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves propagating non-zero values diagonally and horizontally until they reach the boundaries or encounter another non-zero value.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has a vertical line of 8s and a single 9 at the top.
   - The output has the 9 shifted down to the same column as the 8s.
   - The 6 at the bottom is shifted up to the same column as the 8s.
   - The 4 at the bottom is shifted up to the same column as the 8s.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input has a vertical line of 8s and a single 7 at the top.
   - The output has the 7 shifted down to the same column as the 8s.
   - The 3 at the bottom is shifted up to the same column as the 8s.
   - The 1 at the bottom is shifted up to the same column as the 8s.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input has a vertical line of 8s and a single 4 at the top.
   - The output has the 4 shifted down to the same column as the 8s.
   - The 3 at the bottom is shifted up to the same column as the 8s.
   - The 2 at the bottom is shifted up to the same column as the 8s.
   - The 7 at the bottom is shifted up to the same column as the 8s.

From these observations, we can infer the transformation rule:
- For each vertical line of a specific color (represented by a number), shift the highest and lowest numbers in the same column to the same column as the vertical line.
- If there are multiple vertical lines, apply the rule to each line separately.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Grid Size Reduction**: The output grids are smaller than the input grids. Specifically, the output grids are 3x3, while the input grids are 9x9. This suggests that the transformation involves reducing the grid size by a factor of 3 in both dimensions.

2. **Color Selection**: The output grids seem to retain specific colors from the input grids. By examining the examples, we can see that the colors in the output grids correspond to the colors in the central cells of 3x3 sub-grids in the input grids.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: Let's break down the input grids into 3x3 sub-grids and observe the central cell of each sub-grid. The central cell of each 3x3 sub-grid in the input grid corresponds to the same position in the 3x3 output grid.

For example, in Example 1:
- The top-left 3x3 sub-grid of the input has a central cell value of 8.
- The top-middle 3x3 sub-grid of the input has a central cell value of 8.
- The top-right 3x3 sub-grid of the input has a central cell value of 0.
- And so on for the rest of the sub-grids.

This pattern holds for all examples, confirming that the transformation rule involves selecting the central cell of each 3x3 sub-grid in the input grid to form the output grid.

</reasoning>

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Input:
```
[
[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8],
[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 1],

[0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8]
]
```

Breaking it into 3x3 sub-grids and selecting the central cell of each:

- Top-left sub-grid: Central cell is 8.
- Top-middle sub-grid: Central cell is 0.
- Top-right sub-grid: Central cell is 8.
- Middle-left sub-grid: Central cell is 0.
- Middle-middle sub-grid: Central cell is 8.
- Middle-right sub-grid: Central cell is 0.
- Bottom-left sub-grid: Central cell is 0.
- Bottom-middle sub-grid: Central cell is 0.
- Bottom-right sub-grid: Central cell is 1.

Thus, the output grid is:

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Grid Size Reduction**: The output grid is always smaller than the input grid. Specifically, the output grid seems to be a 4x4 grid, regardless of the input grid size.

2. **Color Mapping**: The colors (integers) in the output grid appear to be derived from specific positions in the input grid. Let's examine the patterns:

   - The top-left corner of the output grid often corresponds to the top-left corner of the input grid.
   - The bottom-right corner of the output grid often corresponds to the bottom-right corner of the input grid.
   - The colors in the output grid seem to be influenced by the colors in the input grid, but not directly. There appears to be a pattern where the colors are mapped based on the surrounding colors in the input grid.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: By observing the examples, we can see that the output grid is formed by taking specific colors from the input grid and arranging them in a 4x4 grid. The colors seem to be chosen based on the positions of the '1's in the input grid, which act as a separator or boundary.

4. **Boundary Analysis**: The '1's in the input grid seem to act as a boundary. The colors to the left, right, above, and below the '1's are used to form the output grid.

Given these observations, the transformation rule likely involves:
- Identifying the positions of '1's in the input grid.
- Using the colors surrounding these '1's to form the output grid.
- Arranging these colors in a 4x4 grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:

[8, 0, 8, 0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6],
[0, 8, 0, 8, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0]

```

By identifying the positions of '1's and the surrounding colors, we can deduce the output grid:

- Top-left: 7 (from the top-left corner of the input grid)
- Top-right: 7 (from the top-right corner of the input grid)
- Bottom-left: 8 (from the bottom-left corner of the input grid)
- Bottom-right: 6 (from the bottom-right corner of the input grid)

The output grid is formed by these colors arranged in a 4x4 grid:

The transformation rule appears to involve a consistent mapping of colors (integers) from the input grid to the output grid. By examining the examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

1. The border color (the outermost layer) in the input grid is consistently transformed to a specific color in the output grid.
2. The inner colors are transformed in a way that seems to depend on their position relative to the border and other colors.

Let's analyze the examples to find the specific mappings:

- Example 1:
  - Input border color: 4
  - Output border color: 8
  - Inner colors are transformed in a specific order.

- Example 2:
  - Input border color: 2
  - Output border color: 6
  - Inner colors are transformed in a specific order.

- Example 3:
  - Input border color: 8
  - Output border color: 4
  - Inner colors are transformed in a specific order.

- Example 4:
  - Input border color: 7
  - Output border color: 3
  - Inner colors are transformed in a specific order.

From these observations, we can infer that the border color in the input grid is transformed to a specific color in the output grid, and the inner colors are transformed in a specific order. The transformation seems to involve a consistent mapping of colors from the input to the output.

For the test case, the border color is 8. Based on the examples, we can infer that the border color in the output grid will be 4. The inner colors will be transformed in a specific order, which we need to deduce from the examples.

The transformation rule appears to involve spreading a specific color (represented by the number 8) in a diagonal pattern from its original position. The color 8 seems to be replaced by the color 5 in the output, and this color 5 spreads diagonally in a specific pattern.

In the first example, the color 8 is at position (3, 4). In the output, we see a diagonal pattern of 5s starting from this position and spreading outwards. The same pattern is observed in the second example, where the color 8 is at position (7, 6).

The pattern of spreading seems to be:
- The color 5 appears in a diagonal line starting from the position of the color 8.
- The diagonal line extends in both directions from the color 8.
- The color 5 also appears in a pattern that forms a square around the color 8, with the sides of the square aligned with the grid.

Given this pattern, we can apply the same transformation to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the color of the squares based on their position relative to a central square of color 0. Specifically, the rule seems to be:
1. If a square is directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a square of color 0, it changes to color 0.
2. If a square is diagonally adjacent to a square of color 0, it changes to the original color.
3. If a square is not adjacent to a square of color 0, it remains the same.

This rule is consistent with the provided examples. For instance, in Example 1, the central square is 0, and the squares directly adjacent to it change to 0. In Example 2 and Example 3, the same pattern holds.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting or mirroring the input grid along a diagonal axis. Specifically, it seems that the transformation involves reflecting the grid along the diagonal that runs from the top-left to the bottom-right. This is evident from the examples provided:

- In Example 1, the '7's are reflected along this diagonal.
- In Example 2, the '9's and '5's are reflected along this diagonal.
- In Example 3, the '2's and '5's are reflected along this diagonal.

Given this observation, the transformation rule can be described as follows: for each element in the input grid, the corresponding element in the output grid is the element that is symmetrically opposite with respect to the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right).

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [9, 0, 0],
     [9, 9, 9],
     [9, 9, 9]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [0, 9, 9],
     [0, 9, 9],
     [9, 9, 9]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The top-left corner (9) is replaced with 0, and the rest of the grid is filled with 9s.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [6, 6, 6],
     [0, 0, 0],
     [6, 6, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [6, 0, 0],
     [6, 0, 6],
     [6, 0, 6]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The top-left corner (6) is replaced with 0, and the rest of the grid is filled with 6s.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [0, 0, 9],
     [0, 0, 9],
     [9, 9, 9]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [9, 9, 9],
     [0, 0, 9],
     [0, 0, 9]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The top-left corner (0) is replaced with 9, and the rest of the grid is filled with 0s.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [2, 0, 2],
     [0, 0, 2],
     [0, 2, 2]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [2, 2, 2],
     [0, 0, 2],
     [2, 0, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The top-left corner (2) is replaced with 0, and the rest of the grid is filled with 2s.

From these observations, it seems that the transformation rule involves replacing the top-left corner with the value that is not present in the top-left corner, and then filling the rest of the grid with the value that is present in the top-left corner.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the most frequent color (integer value) in each row of the input grid and then replacing all other colors in that row with zeros, except for the most frequent color, which is replaced with the same color. If there is a tie for the most frequent color, the rule is not immediately clear from the examples provided. However, the examples suggest that the most frequent color is the one that appears in the majority of the cells in the row.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:
1. Identify the most frequent color in each row.
2. Replace all other colors in that row with zeros, except for the most frequent color, which remains the same.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values with a specific value (1) while leaving others unchanged. Specifically, any value that is not a border value (i.e., not on the edge of the grid) and not a zero is replaced with 1. This is evident from the examples provided, where non-border, non-zero values are transformed into 1s in the output grids.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
1. Identify the border values (values on the edges of the grid).
2. Identify the zero values.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the largest connected component of non-zero values in the input grid and then creating a smaller grid that represents this component. The output grid seems to be a 2D array where the dimensions are determined by the bounding box of the largest connected component in the input grid. The values in the output grid correspond to the values in the input grid, but only within the bounding box of the largest connected component.

Let's break down the examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The largest connected component is the '2' and '7' values.
   - The bounding box for this component is from (1,1) to (3,8).
   - The output grid is a 2x4 grid representing this component.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The largest connected component is the '4' and '8' values.
   - The bounding box for this component is from (1,2) to (3,8).
   - The output grid is a 2x2 grid representing this component.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The largest connected component is the '5' and '8' values.
   - The bounding box for this component is from (2,5) to (3,8).
   - The output grid is a 2x4 grid representing this component.

Given this pattern, we can apply the same logic to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve converting the color 8 to a different color based on its position and connectivity. Specifically, the color 8 is transformed into 1 or 2, depending on whether it is part of a connected component that is above or below a certain row. The transformation seems to be as follows:

- If a cell with value 8 is in the upper part of the grid (above a certain row), it is transformed into 1.
- If a cell with value 8 is in the lower part of the grid (below a certain row), it is transformed into 2.
- The exact row that separates the upper and lower parts is not immediately clear from the examples, but it seems to be around the middle of the grid.

Additionally, the transformation does not affect cells with value 0, which remain 0 in the output.

Given this rule, we can apply it to the test case to determine the output.

The transformation rule appears to involve rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise and then adjusting the colors based on their positions. Specifically, the colors seem to be shifted or wrapped around in a specific pattern. For example, in Example 1, the color 5 in the input grid is transformed to color 2 in the output grid, and the color 4 is transformed to color 4. This suggests a systematic shift or wrapping of colors based on their positions in the grid.

To determine the exact rule, we need to observe the patterns in the given examples:
- In Example 1, the colors 2 and 4 in the input grid are transformed to 2 and 4 in the output grid, respectively, but their positions are rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
- In Example 2, the colors 6 and 8 in the input grid are transformed to 6 and 8 in the output grid, respectively, but their positions are rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

Given these observations, the transformation rule likely involves rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise and then applying a specific color transformation based on the new positions of the colors.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the largest contiguous block of a specific color (represented by an integer value) and then creating a smaller grid that represents the boundaries of this block. The output grid seems to be a 5x5 grid that highlights the boundaries of the largest contiguous block of a specific color in the input grid.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Identify the largest contiguous block of a specific color in the input grid.
2. Create a 5x5 output grid where the boundaries of this block are marked with the color value, and the rest of the grid is filled with zeros.
3. The output grid is centered around the largest contiguous block.

For example, in Example 1, the largest contiguous block of color 3 is identified, and the output grid is created to highlight its boundaries. The same logic applies to Examples 2 and 3.

For the test case, we need to identify the largest contiguous block of a specific color and create a 5x5 output grid that highlights its boundaries.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has several clusters of the number 4.
   - The output grid has the number 7 appearing in specific positions relative to the number 4.
   - The number 7 seems to appear in positions that are diagonally adjacent to the number 4.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Similar to Example 1, the number 7 appears in positions diagonally adjacent to the number 4.
   - The number 7 also appears in positions that are directly adjacent to the number 4 in some cases.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves replacing certain zeros with the number 7 based on their proximity to the number 4. Specifically, the number 7 appears in positions that are diagonally adjacent to the number 4 and sometimes directly adjacent.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting the input grid across both the horizontal and vertical axes to create a larger grid. Specifically, the output grid is created by:
1. Reflecting the input grid horizontally to create the bottom half of the output grid.
2. Reflecting the input grid vertically to create the right half of the output grid.
3. The center of the output grid is a reflection of the input grid both horizontally and vertically.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
Input:
[
[1, 6, 6],
[5, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2]

Reflecting horizontally:
[

Reflecting vertically:

The transformation rule appears to involve spreading the non-background colors (non-8 in Example 1, non-1 in Example 2, and non-4 in Example 3) outward from their initial positions. The spread seems to follow a specific pattern:

1. **Example 1**: The '0' and '2' values spread diagonally and horizontally from their initial positions.
2. **Example 2**: The '0' and '3' values spread diagonally and horizontally from their initial positions.
3. **Example 3**: The '0' and '8' values spread diagonally and horizontally from their initial positions.

The spread seems to affect the surrounding cells in a way that maintains the original values but extends them outward. The transformation also seems to respect the boundaries of the grid.

For the test case, we need to apply a similar transformation to the '0' and '6' values, spreading them diagonally and horizontally from their initial positions.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Input and Output Dimensions**: The output grid is always smaller than the input grid. Specifically, the output grid seems to be 6 rows high, regardless of the input grid's height. The width of the output grid is determined by the width of the input grid.

2. **Color Transformation**: The color '4' in the input grid always corresponds to a row of '4's in the output grid. This row is always the last row of the input grid.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: The transformation seems to involve a pattern where the output grid is derived from specific rows and columns of the input grid. The output grid appears to be a condensed version of the input grid, focusing on certain rows and columns.

4. **Specific Patterns**:
   - The first row of the output grid seems to be derived from the first row of the input grid.
   - The second row of the output grid seems to be derived from the second row of the input grid.
   - The third row of the output grid seems to be derived from the third row of the input grid.
   - The fourth row of the output grid seems to be derived from the fourth row of the input grid.
   - The fifth row of the output grid seems to be derived from the fifth row of the input grid.
   - The sixth row of the output grid seems to be derived from the sixth row of the input grid.

5. **Color Mapping**: The colors in the output grid are transformed based on the input grid. Specifically, the color '2' in the input grid corresponds to '3' in the output grid, and '0' in the input grid corresponds to '0' in the output grid.

Given these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- The output grid is a 6-row grid derived from specific rows and columns of the input grid.
- The color '4' in the input grid corresponds to a row of '4's in the output grid.
- The colors '2' and '0' in the input grid are transformed to '3' and '0' respectively in the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values in the input grid with a sequence of zeros. Specifically, the transformation seems to replace a contiguous block of values with zeros, starting from a specific point and extending horizontally or vertically.

From the examples:
- In Example 1, the zeros in the input grid are replaced with a horizontal sequence of zeros in the output grid.
- In Example 2, the zeros in the input grid are replaced with a vertical sequence of zeros in the output grid.
- In Example 3, the zeros in the input grid are replaced with a horizontal sequence of zeros in the output grid.
- In Example 4, the zeros in the input grid are replaced with a horizontal sequence of zeros in the output grid.

The transformation rule seems to be:
1. Identify the position of the zero in the input grid.
2. Replace the zero and its contiguous neighbors (either horizontally or vertically) with zeros in the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve reducing the size of the grid while preserving certain patterns. Specifically, the output grid is a 3x3 grid derived from the input grid. The transformation seems to focus on the central part of the input grid, particularly the middle column and the middle row. The output grid is constructed by taking the central column of the input grid and the central row of the input grid, and then filling in the rest of the grid based on these central elements.

For example, in Example 1, the central column of the input grid is [0, 8, 0, 8, 0] and the central row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The output grid is constructed by taking the central elements and filling in the rest of the grid based on these central elements.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input has '1's at positions (1,6), (3,9), (5,3), (7,7), and (9,1).
   - Output has '1's at positions (1,6), (3,9), (5,3), (7,7), and (9,1).
   - The surrounding values are transformed into a sequence of numbers that seem to follow a pattern.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input has '1's at positions (0,5), (2,0), (3,9), (5,5), (8,2), and (9,9).
   - Output has '1's at positions (0,5), (2,0), (3,9), (5,5), (8,2), and (9,9).
   - The surrounding values are transformed into a sequence of numbers that seem to follow a pattern.

From these observations, it appears that the transformation rule involves:
- Identifying the positions of '1's in the input grid.
- Transforming the surrounding values into a sequence of numbers that follow a specific pattern.

The pattern seems to involve rotating the grid and then applying a transformation that changes the values based on their positions relative to the '1's.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the positions of non-zero values in the input grid and then creating horizontal and vertical lines of the same color at those positions in the output grid. Specifically:

1. For each non-zero value in the input grid, draw a horizontal line of that color across the corresponding row in the output grid.
2. For each non-zero value in the input grid, draw a vertical line of that color down the corresponding column in the output grid.
3. The intersection of these lines will create a cross-like pattern centered at the position of the non-zero value.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting certain colored squares (represented by non-zero integers) to different positions while maintaining the overall structure of the grid. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve moving the colored squares downwards and to the right, while also potentially flipping or rotating certain sections of the grid.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the '5' squares in the top-left corner are moved down and to the right, and the '2' squares in the middle are also moved down and to the right.
2. In Example 2, the '2' and '5' squares are moved down and to the right, and the '5' squares in the top-left corner are flipped or rotated.
3. In Example 3, the '2' and '5' squares are moved down and to the right, and the '5' squares in the top-left corner are flipped or rotated.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to involve moving the colored squares downwards and to the right, while also potentially flipping or rotating certain sections of the grid. The '5' squares in the top-left corner are flipped or rotated, and the '2' squares in the middle are moved down and to the right.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the largest contiguous block of non-zero values in the input grid and then creating a 2x2 output grid where each cell contains the value of the identified color. The largest contiguous block is determined by the number of adjacent cells with the same non-zero value.

In each example:
- Example 1: The largest contiguous block is of color 7, which is transformed into a 2x2 grid of 8s.
- Example 2: The largest contiguous block is of color 7, which is transformed into a 2x2 grid of 7s.
- Example 3: The largest contiguous block is of color 4, which is transformed into a 2x2 grid of 4s.

For the test case, we need to identify the largest contiguous block of non-zero values. The largest contiguous block in the test case is of color 9, which spans multiple rows and columns. Therefore, the output should be a 2x2 grid of 9s.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has several distinct regions of colors.
   - The output grid shows that the regions of color 5 have been transformed to include color 8 in specific positions.
   - The regions of color 7 and 6 remain unchanged.
   - The transformation seems to involve replacing certain colors with a new color (8) in specific patterns.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has regions of colors 5, 9, 6, and 3.
   - The output grid shows that the regions of color 9 have been transformed to include color 3 in specific positions.
   - The regions of color 5 and 6 remain unchanged.
   - The transformation seems to involve replacing certain colors with a new color (3) in specific patterns.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid has regions of colors 2, 4, 5, and 8.
   - The output grid shows that the regions of color 2 have been transformed to include color 8 in specific positions.
   - The regions of color 4 and 5 remain unchanged.
   - The transformation seems to involve replacing certain colors with a new color (8) in specific patterns.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves replacing certain colors with a new color in specific patterns. The new color seems to be introduced in a way that maintains the overall structure of the grid but changes the internal patterns of the regions.

Given these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Replace specific colors with a new color in specific patterns within the regions of the grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in rows with the same color value if that value appears in the row. Specifically, if a non-zero value appears in a row, that value is used to fill the entire row in the output. If a row contains only zeros, it remains unchanged. This rule is consistent across all the provided examples.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
- The first row contains only zeros, so it remains unchanged.
- The second row contains the value 4, so the entire row is filled with 4s.
- The third row contains only zeros, so it remains unchanged.
- The fourth row contains the value 3, so the entire row is filled with 3s.
- The fifth row contains only zeros, so it remains unchanged.
- The sixth row contains the value 2, so the entire row is filled with 2s.
- The seventh row contains only zeros, so it remains unchanged.
- The eighth row contains the value 6, so the entire row is filled with 6s.
- The ninth row contains only zeros, so it remains unchanged.
- The tenth row contains the value 9, so the entire row is filled with 9s.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting the non-zero values upwards while maintaining their relative positions. Specifically, each row of non-zero values is moved up to the first available row above it that contains only zeros. The zeros in the input grid remain in place, and the non-zero values are shifted up row by row until they reach the top of the grid or encounter another non-zero value.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:
1. Identify the rows with non-zero values.
2. Shift these rows upwards until they reach the top or encounter another non-zero value.
3. Fill the remaining rows with zeros.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input is a 16x16 grid.
   - Output is a 3x3 grid.
   - The output grid seems to be a summary or a reduction of the input grid.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input is a 16x16 grid.
   - Output is a 3x3 grid.
   - Similar to Example 1, the output grid is a reduced version of the input grid.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input is a 16x16 grid.
   - Output is a 3x3 grid.
   - Again, the output grid is a reduced version of the input grid.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves reducing a 16x16 grid to a 3x3 grid. One possible rule is to take the most frequent color in each 4x4 sub-grid of the input and place it in the corresponding position in the output grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- Divide the 16x16 grid into 4x4 sub-grids.
- For each 4x4 sub-grid, determine the most frequent color.
- Place this color in the corresponding position in the 3x3 output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve several steps:

1. **Identify and Remove Zeros**: The transformation seems to remove all zero values from the grid, effectively shrinking the grid.
2. **Compress Rows and Columns**: The remaining non-zero values are compressed into a smaller grid. This compression is done row-wise and column-wise, removing any empty rows or columns that result from the removal of zeros.
3. **Maintain Relative Positions**: The relative positions of the non-zero values are maintained during the compression. This means that if a non-zero value is to the left or right of another in the original grid, it will be to the left or right in the compressed grid as well.
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: If a row or column is entirely composed of zeros, it is removed from the output grid.

By applying these steps to the test case, we can determine the transformed output grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has several '5's scattered throughout.
   - The output grid has '4's appearing in specific locations.
   - The '4's seem to replace '5's that are surrounded by other '5's or are part of a larger cluster of '5's.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Similar to Example 1, '4's appear in the output where '5's are surrounded by other '5's.
   - The transformation seems to involve replacing '5's that are part of a cluster with '4's.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Again, '4's replace '5's that are part of a cluster.
   - The transformation rule appears to be consistent across all examples.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- Replace '5's that are part of a cluster (surrounded by other '5's) with '4's.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values with the number 8 based on the presence of the number 1 in the input grid. Specifically, the number 8 seems to be placed in positions that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to the number 1. Additionally, the number 8 is placed in a way that it seems to ""connect"" or ""surround"" the number 1.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the number 8 is placed around the number 1, creating a connected path.
2. In Example 2, the number 8 is placed around the number 1, creating a connected path.
3. In Example 3, the number 8 is placed around the number 1, creating a connected path.
4. In Example 4, the number 8 is placed around the number 1, creating a connected path.

Based on this observation, the transformation rule seems to be:
- Replace all 1s with 1s.
- Replace all 0s with 8s if they are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a 1.
- Leave all other 0s as 0s.

The transformation rule appears to involve the placement of the number 8 in specific positions relative to the number 3 in the input grid. Here's the pattern observed:

1. For each occurrence of the number 3 in the input grid, an 8 is placed in the output grid at specific positions relative to the 3.
2. The 8 is placed directly above the 3, directly to the left of the 3, and directly to the right of the 3.
3. If a 3 is at the edge of the grid, the 8 will not be placed outside the grid boundaries.
4. The 8s are placed in a way that they do not overwrite existing 3s or other 8s.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has several occurrences of the number 8.
   - The output grid replaces some 8s with 3s and 2s in a specific pattern.
   - The pattern seems to involve replacing 8s with 3s and 2s based on their position relative to other 8s and possibly other numbers.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid has several occurrences of the number 8 and other numbers.
   - The output grid replaces some 8s with 1s, 4s, and other numbers in a specific pattern.
   - The pattern seems to involve replacing 8s with 1s and 4s based on their position relative to other 8s and possibly other numbers.

From these observations, it appears that the transformation rule involves replacing certain numbers (likely 8s) with other numbers (3s, 2s, 1s, 4s) based on their position and possibly the values of neighboring cells.

Let's hypothesize that the transformation rule is as follows:
- Replace 8s with 3s and 2s in a specific pattern.
- The pattern might involve checking the values of neighboring cells and replacing 8s accordingly.

Given the complexity and the lack of a clear pattern, we need to apply this rule to the test case and see if we can deduce the correct output.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain '8' values with '6' values based on their proximity to '1' values. Specifically, '8' values that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to '1' values are transformed into '6' values. Additionally, '1' values that are surrounded by '8' values on all sides are transformed into '6' values. This transformation seems to propagate outward from the '1' values, affecting adjacent '8' values.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:
1. Identify all '1' values and their adjacent '8' values.
2. Replace the adjacent '8' values with '6' values.
3. Check for any '1' values that are surrounded by '8' values and replace them with '6' values if necessary.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting the grid across a central vertical line and then swapping specific colors based on their positions relative to this line. Specifically, the colors seem to be swapped in a way that maintains the overall structure but changes the colors in a mirrored fashion.

Let's break down the transformation rule:
1. Reflect the grid across the central vertical line.
2. Swap specific colors based on their positions relative to this line.

For example, in Example 1, the colors 3 and 8 are swapped in the reflected positions. Similarly, in Example 2, the colors 3 and 4 are swapped in the reflected positions. In Example 3, the colors 2 and 4 are swapped in the reflected positions.

Given this understanding, we can apply the same transformation to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has a structure where the number '3' appears in a vertical line, and other numbers are scattered around it.
   - The output grid seems to be a simplified version where the '3' column is preserved, and other numbers are transformed into a sequence of '1's and '2's.
   - The '8' column is preserved, and the rest of the grid is filled with '0's.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has a structure where the number '4' appears in a vertical line, and other numbers are scattered around it.
   - The output grid seems to be a simplified version where the '4' column is preserved, and other numbers are transformed into a sequence of '0's and '1's.
   - The '8' column is preserved, and the rest of the grid is filled with '0's.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid has a structure where the number '3' appears in a vertical line, and other numbers are scattered around it.
   - The output grid seems to be a simplified version where the '3' column is preserved, and other numbers are transformed into a sequence of '2's and '4's.
   - The '8' column is preserved, and the rest of the grid is filled with '0's.

From these observations, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- Identify the column with the most frequent occurrence of a specific number (e.g., '3' in Example 1, '4' in Example 2, '3' in Example 3).
- Preserve this column in the output grid.
- Transform other columns into a sequence of '0's and the next highest number in the input grid.
- Preserve the '8' column if it exists.
- Fill the rest of the grid with '0's.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

```

The most frequent number in the input grid is '1'. The '8' column is also present.

Applying the transformation rule:
- Preserve the '1' column.
- Transform other columns into a sequence of '0's and '2's.
- Preserve the '8' column.
- Fill the rest of the grid with '0's.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the unique non-zero values in the input grid and then creating a smaller grid where each unique value is represented by a single instance of that value. The output grid is a 3x3 grid, and the position of each unique value in the output grid seems to correspond to its position in the input grid.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In Example 1, the unique non-zero values are 1 and 5. The output grid has 1s and 5s in positions that correspond to their first appearances in the input grid.
- In Example 2, the unique non-zero value is 4. The output grid has 4s in positions that correspond to their first appearances in the input grid.
- In Example 3, the unique non-zero values are 2 and 5. The output grid has 2s and 5s in positions that correspond to their first appearances in the input grid.

Given this pattern, the transformation rule seems to be:
1. Identify the unique non-zero values in the input grid.
2. Create a 3x3 output grid.
3. Place each unique value in the output grid based on its first appearance in the input grid.

For the test case, the unique non-zero value is 3 and 5. We need to place these values in the output grid based on their first appearances in the input grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve rotating the non-zero values in the input grid in a specific pattern. Observing the examples, we can see that the non-zero values are shifted diagonally down and to the right. Specifically, each non-zero value in the input grid is moved to a position that is diagonally down and to the right by a number of steps equal to its value.

For example, in Example 1, the value 3 is moved diagonally down and to the right by 3 steps. In Example 2, the value 4 is moved diagonally down and to the right by 4 steps. This pattern holds for all the examples provided.

To apply this rule to the test case, we need to identify the non-zero values and move them diagonally down and to the right by the number of steps equal to their value.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting or mirroring certain parts of the grid. Specifically, it seems that the transformation involves reflecting the grid along the vertical axis (left to right) for the color 8, and possibly other colors as well. Let's analyze the examples to confirm this hypothesis:

- In Example 1, the color 8 on the right side of the grid is mirrored to the left side.
- In Example 2, the color 8 on the right side of the grid is mirrored to the left side, and the color 4 remains unchanged.
- In Example 3, the color 8 on the right side of the grid is mirrored to the left side, and the color 4 remains unchanged.

Given this pattern, the transformation rule seems to be:
1. Reflect the color 8 across the vertical axis.
2. Leave the color 4 unchanged.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the values of certain cells based on their neighborhood. Specifically, the value of a cell seems to change to 2 or 7 based on the presence of 1s in its immediate neighborhood (up, down, left, right). Here's a breakdown of the observed patterns:

1. If a cell is surrounded by 1s (up, down, left, right), it changes to 2.
2. If a cell is surrounded by 0s (up, down, left, right), it changes to 7.
3. If a cell is surrounded by a mix of 1s and 0s, it remains 1.
4. If a cell is on the boundary and has fewer than four neighbors, the transformation rule seems to apply only to the available neighbors.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has several non-zero values scattered throughout.
   - The output grid has these non-zero values shifted to the right and down.
   - Specifically, values seem to be moved to the right by 10 columns and down by 10 rows.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Similar to Example 1, non-zero values are shifted to the right and down.
   - The shift is consistent with a right shift of 10 columns and a down shift of 10 rows.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Again, non-zero values are shifted to the right and down.
   - The shift is consistent with a right shift of 10 columns and a down shift of 10 rows.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Shift all non-zero values 10 columns to the right.
- Shift all non-zero values 10 rows down.
- If the shift moves a value out of the grid boundaries, it is discarded.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has several clusters of colored squares.
   - The output grid has the same clusters, but some values have changed, particularly in the lower right corners of the clusters.
   - The changes seem to involve the color 3 and 4.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Similar to Example 1, the output grid has changes in the lower right corners of clusters, particularly involving the color 3 and 4.
   - The color 3 seems to be replaced by 1 in some cases.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Again, the output grid shows changes in the lower right corners of clusters.
   - The color 3 is replaced by 1 in some cases, and the color 4 is replaced by 3 in some cases.

From these observations, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- If a cluster of color 4 has a lower right corner, it is replaced by 3.
- If a cluster of color 3 has a lower right corner, it is replaced by 1.

This rule seems to apply consistently across the examples. Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing certain values of 5 to 2. Specifically, the rule seems to be that any 5 that is not on the edge of a contiguous block of 5s is transformed into a 2. This is evident in both examples provided:

- In Example 1, the inner 5s in the block of 5s are transformed into 2s.
- In Example 2, the inner 5s in the block of 5s are also transformed into 2s.

The transformation does not affect the 5s on the edges of the blocks or the 0s. Therefore, the rule can be summarized as: change all 5s that are not on the edge of a contiguous block of 5s to 2s.

Observations:
1. The transformation seems to involve rotating the grid 180 degrees.
2. Each element in the input grid is moved to the corresponding position in the output grid after a 180-degree rotation.

Let's verify this hypothesis with the given examples:
- For Example 1, rotating the input grid 180 degrees results in the output grid.
- For Example 2, rotating the input grid 180 degrees results in the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing the initial grid of zeros with a pattern that alternates between the numbers 8 and 1. The pattern seems to depend on the number of columns in the input grid. Specifically, the pattern repeats every two columns, and the starting point of the pattern alternates between rows.

For a grid with 2 columns, the pattern is:
```
[8, 1]
[1, 8]
```

For a grid with 3 columns, the pattern is:
```
[8, 1, 8]
[1, 8, 8]
```

For a grid with 4 columns, the pattern is:
```
[8, 8, 8, 1]
[8, 8, 1, 8]
```

Following this pattern, for a grid with 5 columns, the pattern should be:
```
[8, 8, 8, 8, 1]

[8, 8, 1, 8, 8]

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the unique non-zero values in the input grid and then creating a new grid where these values are used to form specific patterns. The patterns seem to be based on the positions of these unique values. Specifically, the transformation involves:

1. Identifying the unique non-zero values in the input grid.
2. Creating a new grid where the unique values are used to form a border around the grid and a cross-like pattern extending from the positions of these values.
3. The border and cross patterns are filled with the respective unique values.

For example, in Example 1, the unique non-zero values are 6 and 7. The value 6 is used to form the top-left border and cross, while the value 7 is used to form the bottom-right border and cross. In Example 2, the unique non-zero values are 1 and 4, and they follow a similar pattern.

Given this understanding, we can apply the same rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the top-left corner of each contiguous block of non-zero values in the input grid and then creating a smaller grid where each element represents the color of the top-left corner of the corresponding block in the input grid. The output grid is a 4x4 grid, and each element in the output grid corresponds to the top-left corner of a 3x3 block in the input grid.

Let's break down the transformation rule step by step:

1. Divide the input grid into 3x3 blocks.
2. Identify the top-left corner of each contiguous block of non-zero values within each 3x3 block.
3. Create a 4x4 output grid where each element represents the color of the top-left corner of the corresponding block in the input grid.

For example, in Example 1:
- The top-left 3x3 block contains the top-left corner of the block of 8s.
- The second 3x3 block contains the top-left corner of the block of 2s.
- The third 3x3 block contains the top-left corner of the block of 1s.
- The fourth 3x3 block contains the top-left corner of the block of 3s.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding each colored square in the input grid into a larger block of the same color in the output grid. Specifically, each non-zero value in the input grid is expanded into a block of the same value, with the size of the block being determined by the position of the value in the input grid. The blocks are arranged in a way that maintains the relative positions of the original values.

For example, in Example 1, the value '2' in the top-left corner of the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block of '2's in the top-left corner of the output grid. The value '7' in the bottom-middle of the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block of '7's in the bottom-middle of the output grid.

The output grid is always a 6x6 grid, and the input grid is always a 3x3 grid. The transformation seems to involve doubling the dimensions of the input grid and then filling in the appropriate blocks of color.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying specific patterns or shapes within the input grid and then modifying the grid based on these patterns. Let's break down the observations from the examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has a large rectangle of color 8 with a smaller rectangle of color 2 inside it.
   - The output grid has the same large rectangle of color 8 but with additional color 2 squares at specific positions, particularly at the corners and along the edges of the inner rectangle.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has a large rectangle of color 1 with a smaller rectangle of color 4 inside it.
   - The output grid has the same large rectangle of color 1 but with additional color 4 squares at specific positions, particularly at the corners and along the edges of the inner rectangle.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid has a large rectangle of color 2 with a smaller rectangle of color 3 inside it.
   - The output grid has the same large rectangle of color 2 but with additional color 3 squares at specific positions, particularly at the corners and along the edges of the inner rectangle.

From these observations, it seems that the transformation rule involves:
- Identifying the largest rectangle of a specific color.
- Identifying the smallest rectangle of a different color inside the larger rectangle.
- Adding the smaller rectangle's color to specific positions around the larger rectangle.

Given this rule, let's apply it to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve the propagation of the color value 1 (or any non-zero value) to its neighboring cells. Specifically, the rule seems to be:
1. If a cell contains a 1, it propagates to its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) with a value of 3.
2. This propagation continues until there are no more cells to propagate to.
3. The original 1s remain as 1s, and the propagated values are 3s.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step.

The transformation rule appears to involve the propagation of certain colors (represented by integers) from the edges of the grid inward. Specifically, the colors 2 and 3 seem to propagate inward, replacing other colors in their path. Additionally, the color 4 seems to propagate from the bottom edge inward. The propagation stops when it encounters a boundary or another color that does not propagate.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the color 2 propagates from the left and right edges, and the color 3 propagates from the bottom edge. The color 4 also propagates from the bottom edge but stops when it encounters the color 3.

2. In Example 2, the color 2 propagates from the left and right edges, and the color 4 propagates from the bottom edge. The color 7 also propagates from the bottom edge but stops when it encounters the color 4.

3. In Example 3, the color 4 propagates from the left and right edges, and the color 8 propagates from the bottom edge. The color 6 also propagates from the bottom edge but stops when it encounters the color 8.

Based on this analysis, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- Colors 2 and 3 propagate from the left and right edges inward.
- Color 4 propagates from the bottom edge inward.
- The propagation stops when it encounters a boundary or another color that does not propagate.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the unique non-zero values in the input grid, determining their boundaries, and then creating a smaller grid that represents the boundaries of these values. The output grid seems to be a simplified representation of the input grid, focusing on the outermost layer of the non-zero values.

Let's break down the transformation rule based on the given examples:

1. **Identify the non-zero values**: In each example, the non-zero values form distinct shapes within the grid.
2. **Determine the boundaries**: The output grid represents the boundaries of these shapes.
3. **Create the output grid**: The output grid is a smaller representation that highlights the boundaries of the non-zero values.

For Example 1:
- The non-zero values form a diamond shape with the number 4 in the center.
- The output grid represents the boundaries of this diamond shape.

For Example 2:
- The non-zero values form a vertical line with the number 1 on the sides and 3 in the middle.
- The output grid represents the boundaries of this vertical line.

For Example 3:
- The non-zero values form a horizontal line with the number 4 on the sides and 6 in the middle.
- The output grid represents the boundaries of this horizontal line.

Given this understanding, let's apply the transformation rule to the test case.

From these examples, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- The output grid is a 4x4 grid.
- The value in the output grid is determined by the presence of the number 7 in the corresponding 2x2 sub-grid of the input grid.
- If a 2x2 sub-grid contains a 7, the corresponding cell in the output grid is set to 3.
- If a 2x2 sub-grid does not contain a 7, the corresponding cell in the output grid is set to 0.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

   - Observation: The output grid is a 3x3 grid repeated to form a 6x6 grid. Each element in the output grid is a reflection of the input grid.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves reflecting the input grid to form a larger grid. The size of the output grid is double the size of the input grid in both dimensions. The elements are mirrored across the center of the grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve spreading a color (represented by a non-zero integer) from its original position to adjacent cells in a specific pattern. Let's break down the observations from the examples:

1. **Example 1**: The '8' spreads to the right and down, and the '3' and '2' spread to the right and down as well. The '3' and '2' also seem to spread to the left and up, but only if there is no other color in the way.
2. **Example 2**: The '3' spreads to the right and down, and the '6' seems to be a border color that appears around the '3'.
3. **Example 3**: The '3' spreads to the right and down, and the '2' spreads to the right and down. The '6' again seems to be a border color.
4. **Example 4**: The '8' spreads to the right and down, and the '4' seems to be a border color that appears around the '8'.

From these observations, we can infer the following rules:
- Each non-zero integer spreads to the right and down.
- A border color (likely '6' or '4') appears around the spread.
- The spread stops if it encounters another color or the edge of the grid.

Given these rules, we can apply them to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting or mirroring the non-zero values across the grid. Specifically, for each non-zero value in the input grid, the output grid seems to have the same value mirrored horizontally and vertically. Additionally, there are patterns of repeating values (like 1s) that seem to fill in the gaps between the mirrored values.

Let's break down the observations:
1. Non-zero values in the input grid are mirrored both horizontally and vertically in the output grid.
2. The value 1 is used to fill in the gaps between the mirrored values.
3. The value 8 seems to be a special case, as it is mirrored but also appears to have a specific pattern around it.

Given these observations, we can infer the transformation rule and apply it to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in the gaps between the colored squares (non-zero values) with a specific color. This color is determined by the highest value in the input grid. The transformation seems to follow these steps:

1. Identify the highest value in the input grid.
2. For each row, fill in the gaps between the colored squares with the highest value identified in step 1.
3. If a row is entirely filled with the highest value, it remains unchanged.
4. If a row contains a different color, the transformation will fill the gaps with the highest value.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing each non-zero value in the input grid with a specific value based on its position relative to other non-zero values. Specifically, the rule seems to be:

1. Replace all zeros with a value of 5.
2. Replace all non-zero values with a value of 8.
3. If a non-zero value is adjacent to another non-zero value (horizontally or vertically), replace it with a value of 5.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step.

First, we replace all zeros with 5 and all non-zero values with 8:
```
[

[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5]

Next, we check for adjacent non-zero values and replace them with 5:

     ```
     [
     [2, 2, 0],
     [0, 2, 0],
     [0, 0, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Output: `[7]`
   - Observation: The input grid has a central 2 surrounded by 2s and 0s.

From these observations, it seems that the transformation rule is based on the value of the central element and the surrounding elements. Specifically:
- If the central element is 2 and surrounded by 0s and 2s, the output is `[1]`.
- If the central element is 0 and surrounded by 2s and 0s, the output is `[7]`.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
- Input:
  ```
  [
  [2, 0, 2],
  [2, 2, 2],
  [2, 0, 2]
  ]
  ```
- The central element is 2, and it is surrounded by 2s and 0s.

Based on the observed pattern, the output should be `[1]`.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in the grid with the same color as the input cells, but extending the color to the right and downwards until it reaches the edge of the grid or another color. Specifically, for each cell with a non-zero value, the color spreads to the right and downwards, filling all subsequent cells in that row and column with the same color.

Let's break down the examples:

- In Example 1, the '8' at (3,1) spreads to the right and downwards, filling the cells to the right and below it.
- In Example 2, the '8' at (1,7) and (3,2) spread similarly.
- In Example 3, the '8' at various positions spread to the right and downwards.

The transformation rule can be summarized as:
1. For each non-zero cell, fill all cells to the right and below it with the same color.
2. If a cell is already filled with a different color, do not overwrite it.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting the positions of certain colors (represented by integers) in the grid. Specifically, it seems that the color '1' is being shifted to the right by one column, and the color '2' is being shifted to the left by one column. Additionally, the color '5' remains unchanged in its position. This transformation is applied to each row of the grid independently.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:
1. Identify the positions of '1' and '2' in each row.
2. Shift '1' to the right by one column.
3. Shift '2' to the left by one column.
4. Leave '5' and other colors unchanged.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values with the number 3, which seems to act as a border or separator. Specifically, the number 3 is placed around clusters of the number 2. This suggests that the rule is to identify all occurrences of the number 2 and place a 3 around them, effectively creating a border.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Identify all occurrences of the number 2 in the input grid.
2. For each occurrence of 2, place a 3 in all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) if they are not already a 2 or another 3.
3. Leave all other numbers unchanged.

By applying this rule to the test case, we can determine the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying contiguous blocks of the color represented by the integer 2 and then mapping these blocks to a smaller grid. The output grid seems to be a 3x3 grid where each cell represents a specific region of the input grid. The value in the output grid is 1 if the corresponding region in the input grid contains at least one block of the color 2, and 0 otherwise.

To determine the regions, we can divide the input grid into 3x3 sections. Each section in the output grid corresponds to a 2x2 section in the input grid. If any of the 2x2 sections contain the color 2, the corresponding cell in the output grid is set to 1.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a pattern of 8s and 4s.
   - The output grid is a 3x3 grid with 8s and 0s.
   - The 8s in the output seem to correspond to the positions of the 8s in the input grid, but only in a specific 3x3 section of the input grid.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid has a pattern of 2s and 1s.
   - The output grid is a 3x3 grid with 2s and 0s.
   - The 2s in the output seem to correspond to the positions of the 2s in the input grid, but only in a specific 3x3 section of the input grid.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input grid has a pattern of 3s and 6s.
   - The output grid is a 3x3 grid with 3s and 0s.
   - The 3s in the output seem to correspond to the positions of the 3s in the input grid, but only in a specific 3x3 section of the input grid.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves:
- Identifying a specific 3x3 section of the input grid.
- Mapping the non-zero values in this section to the output grid.
- The rest of the output grid is filled with 0s.

Given the test case, we need to identify the 3x3 section that contains the non-zero values and map them to the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the color of certain squares based on their position relative to other squares of the same color. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve changing the color of squares that are adjacent to other squares of the same color in a specific pattern. The new colors are 6, 7, and 8, which seem to replace the original color 5 under certain conditions.

From the examples, we can infer the following:
1. If a square of color 5 is adjacent to another square of color 5 (horizontally or vertically), it is transformed into color 6.
2. If a square of color 5 is adjacent to two or more squares of color 5 (horizontally or vertically), it is transformed into color 7.
3. If a square of color 5 is adjacent to three or more squares of color 5 (horizontally or vertically), it is transformed into color 8.

Additionally, the transformation seems to be applied iteratively, meaning that the transformation of one square can affect the transformation of its neighbors in subsequent steps.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting the non-zero values to the right and downwards, while preserving the overall structure of the grid. Specifically, for each non-zero value, it seems to be shifted to the right until it reaches the edge of the grid or another non-zero value, and then downwards until it reaches the bottom of the grid or another non-zero value. The zero values are then filled in to maintain the grid structure.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:
1. Identify all non-zero values and their positions.
2. Shift each non-zero value to the right until it reaches the edge or another non-zero value.
3. Shift each non-zero value downwards until it reaches the bottom or another non-zero value.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values based on their positions relative to other values in the grid. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve replacing '0' values with '1' or '8' based on their proximity to '2' values. Here's a breakdown of the observed patterns:

1. **Replacing '0' with '1'**: In the output grids, '0' values that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to '2' values are often replaced with '1'. This is seen in all examples, particularly in the lower parts of the grids.

2. **Replacing '0' with '8'**: '0' values that are adjacent to '2' values but in a specific pattern (often forming a boundary or edge) are replaced with '8'. This is seen in the upper parts of the grids, especially where '2' values form a boundary.

3. **Preserving '2' values**: '2' values are generally preserved in their positions.

4. **Boundary Conditions**: The transformation seems to handle boundary conditions by ensuring that '2' values at the edges are properly transformed to '8' or '1' based on their adjacency.

Given these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- Replace '0' with '1' if it is adjacent to a '2'.
- Replace '0' with '8' if it is at the boundary and adjacent to a '2'.
- Preserve '2' values.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the largest connected components of each color in the input grid and then outputting the colors of these components in a specific order. The order seems to be from top to bottom and left to right. Here's how we can deduce the rule:

1. **Identify Connected Components**: For each color, identify the largest connected component. A connected component is a group of squares of the same color that are adjacent to each other (horizontally or vertically).

2. **Sort by Size**: Sort these components by their size in descending order.

3. **Output the Colors**: Output the colors of these components in the order of their size.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- **Color 3**: The largest connected component is a 2x1 block.
- **Color 1**: The largest connected component is a 2x3 block.
- **Color 6**: The largest connected component is a 3x3 block.

Since the largest component is color 6, followed by color 1, and then color 3, the output should be [6, 1, 3].

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values in the grid with the value `3` under specific conditions. Let's analyze the examples to deduce the rule:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has several `0` values.
   - The output grid replaces some `0` values with `3` values.
   - The `3` values seem to appear in contiguous blocks of `0` values, especially in the lower part of the grid.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has several `0` values.
   - The output grid replaces some `0` values with `3` values.
   - The `3` values seem to appear in contiguous blocks of `0` values, especially in the lower part of the grid.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid has several `0` values.
   - The output grid replaces some `0` values with `3` values.
   - The `3` values seem to appear in contiguous blocks of `0` values, especially in the lower part of the grid.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is to replace contiguous blocks of `0` values with `3` values, especially in the lower part of the grid. The exact criteria for replacing `0` with `3` are not fully clear, but it seems to involve contiguous blocks of `0` values.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting and rotating the input grid to produce the output grid. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve the following steps:

1. **Reflection**: The grid is reflected across the vertical axis (left to right).
2. **Rotation**: The reflected grid is then rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
3. **Color Replacement**: Certain colors are replaced with specific patterns. For example, in the first example, the color 7 is replaced with a pattern that includes 2s and 7s. In the second example, the color 8 is replaced with a pattern that includes 6s and 8s.

By analyzing the examples, we can see that the transformation involves a combination of reflection, rotation, and color replacement. The specific patterns for color replacement seem to depend on the color values in the input grid.

For the test case, we need to apply these steps to the input grid to determine the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values with specific patterns based on their surroundings. Here's a breakdown of the observed patterns:

1. **Border Replacement**: The border of the grid is replaced with the value `3`.
2. **Value Replacement**: Certain values are replaced with `2` or `8` based on their surroundings.
   - In Example 1, the value `8` is surrounded by `3` and remains `8`.
   - In Example 2, the value `1` is surrounded by `3` and remains `1`, but when surrounded by `2`, it becomes `2`.
   - In Example 3, the value `4` is surrounded by `3` and remains `4`, but when surrounded by `2`, it becomes `2`.

Given these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- Replace all `0` values with `3`.
- Replace all `8` values with `7`.
- Replace all `1` values with `2` if surrounded by `2`, otherwise remain `1`.
- Replace all `4` values with `2` if surrounded by `2`, otherwise remain `4`.

The transformation rule appears to involve removing every second column from the input grid to produce the output grid. This is evident from the provided examples:

- In Example 1, the input grid has 9 columns, and the output grid has 3 columns, which is one-third of the input grid's columns.
- In Example 2, the input grid has 12 columns, and the output grid has 4 columns, which is one-third of the input grid's columns.
- In Example 3, the input grid has 6 columns, and the output grid has 2 columns, which is one-third of the input grid's columns.

Given this pattern, we can infer that the transformation rule is to remove every second column from the input grid to produce the output grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [0, 0, 5],
     [0, 5, 0],
     [5, 0, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [3, 3, 3],
     [4, 4, 4],
     [2, 2, 2]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output grid seems to be a transformation based on the position of the '5's in the input grid. The '5's in the input grid are transformed into '2', '3', and '4' in the output grid.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [0, 0, 5],
     [0, 0, 5],
     [0, 0, 5]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [3, 3, 3],
     [3, 3, 3],
     [3, 3, 3]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: All '5's in the input grid are transformed into '3' in the output grid.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [5, 0, 0],
     [0, 5, 0],
     [5, 0, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [2, 2, 2],
     [4, 4, 4],
     [2, 2, 2]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The '5's in the input grid are transformed into '2', '4', and '2' in the output grid.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [0, 5, 0],
     [0, 0, 5],
     [0, 5, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [4, 4, 4],
     [3, 3, 3],
     [4, 4, 4]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The '5's in the input grid are transformed into '4', '3', and '4' in the output grid.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is based on the position of the '5's in the input grid. Specifically:
- If a '5' is in the top row, it transforms to '2'.
- If a '5' is in the middle row, it transforms to '4'.
- If a '5' is in the bottom row, it transforms to '3'.

All other values (0 in this case) transform to '3' if they are in the same row as a '5', and '4' if they are in the same column as a '5'.

</reasoning>

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 5],
[5, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 0]
]
```

- The '5' in the first row, third column transforms to '2'.
- The '5' in the second row, first column transforms to '4'.
- The '5' in the third row, second column transforms to '3'.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the value of certain cells based on the presence of the color 1 in adjacent cells. Specifically, if a cell contains a 0 and is adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a cell containing a 1, it is transformed into a 2. This rule is applied iteratively, and the transformation seems to stop when no more changes can be made.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In Example 1, the 2s appear in cells that are adjacent to the 1s in the input.
- In Example 2, the 2s also appear in cells that are adjacent to the 1s in the input.
- In Example 3, the 2s appear in cells that are adjacent to the 1s in the input, and the transformation stops when no more changes can be made.

Given this pattern, we can apply the same rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain colors (integer values) with a specific color (integer value) based on their position relative to other colors. Specifically, the rule seems to be:

1. Identify the color that is directly below a given color.
2. Replace the given color with the color directly below it, if it exists.
3. If there is no color directly below, the color remains unchanged.

This rule is applied to each element in the grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step.

   - Observation: The fourth row is transformed by replacing the first and last elements with the value of the fifth row's middle element.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves replacing the first and last elements of a row with the value of the middle element of the row directly below it. This rule applies to the top four rows of the grid.

Applying the transformation rule:
1. The first row remains unchanged because there is no row above it.
2. The second row remains unchanged because there is no row above it.
3. The third row remains unchanged because there is no row above it.
4. The fourth row remains unchanged because there is no row above it.
5. The fifth row remains unchanged because there is no row above it.
6. The sixth row remains unchanged because there is no row above it.
7. The seventh row remains unchanged because there is no row above it.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values in the input grid with a specific value (8 in Example 1, 2 in Example 2, and 1 in Example 3) based on the surrounding values. Specifically, it seems that if a value is surrounded by a certain number of other values, it gets transformed into the specific value.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The value 8 is transformed into 8 if it is surrounded by 0s or other 8s.
   - The value 2 is transformed into 8 if it is surrounded by 0s or other 2s.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The value 2 is transformed into 2 if it is surrounded by 0s or other 2s.
   - The value 1 is transformed into 2 if it is surrounded by 0s or other 1s.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The value 1 is transformed into 1 if it is surrounded by 0s or other 1s.
   - The value 3 is transformed into 1 if it is surrounded by 0s or other 3s.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is to replace a value with a specific value if it is surrounded by a certain number of other values. In the test case, the value 9 is the specific value that needs to be transformed.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the color of certain squares based on their position relative to other squares of the same color. Specifically, it seems that the color of a square is changed to a new color if it is surrounded by other squares of the same color in a specific pattern.

In the given examples, the color 4 is transformed into either 1 or 2 under certain conditions. The transformation seems to depend on the position of the square relative to the edges of the grid and the presence of other squares of color 4.

For example, in Example 1, the squares of color 4 in the middle of the grid are transformed into 1, while the squares of color 4 at the edges are transformed into 2. In Example 2, a similar pattern is observed, with the middle squares of color 4 being transformed into 2 and the edge squares being transformed into 1.

Based on this observation, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- If a square of color 4 is surrounded by other squares of color 4 on all sides (up, down, left, right), it is transformed into 1.
- If a square of color 4 is on the edge of the grid and is surrounded by other squares of color 4 on three sides, it is transformed into 2.
- If a square of color 4 is on the edge of the grid and is surrounded by other squares of color 4 on two sides, it is transformed into 2.
- If a square of color 4 is on the edge of the grid and is surrounded by other squares of color 4 on one side, it is transformed into 2.
- If a square of color 4 is on the edge of the grid and is surrounded by other squares of color 4 on no sides, it is transformed into 2.

     [4, 4, 0, 3, 3, 0],
     [4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],

     ]
     ```
   - Output:

     [6, 6, 6],
     [6, 0, 0],
     [6, 0, 6]
     ]
     ```

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0],
     [0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 3],

     ]
     ```
   - Output:

     [0, 6, 6],
     [6, 6, 6],
     [6, 6, 6]

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [4, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
     [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [0, 6, 0],
     [6, 0, 0],
     [6, 6, 6]
     ]
     ```

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:
- The output grid is smaller than the input grid.
- The output grid seems to be a 3x3 grid.
- The transformation rule appears to involve checking the presence of specific colors (4 and 3) in the input grid and transforming them into the color 6 in the output grid.
- The output grid seems to be a 3x3 grid where the presence of 4 or 3 in the input grid results in 6 in the output grid, and the absence results in 0.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```
[
[0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0],
[4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0],
[0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0]
]
```

We need to transform this into a 3x3 grid based on the presence of 4 or 3.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the color values based on their positions and possibly their connectivity. Specifically, the color value 5 in the input grid is transformed into either 1 or 2 in the output grid. The transformation seems to depend on the position and the connectivity of the 5s in the input grid.

Observing the examples:
- In Example 1, the 5s in the input grid are transformed into 2s in the output grid, except for the top-left 5, which is transformed into 1.
- In Example 2, the 5s in the input grid are transformed into 1s and 2s in the output grid, with 1s appearing in the top-left and bottom-right corners, and 2s appearing in the middle.
- In Example 3, the 5s in the input grid are transformed into 1s and 2s in the output grid, with 1s appearing in the top-left and bottom-right corners, and 2s appearing in the middle.

The transformation rule seems to be:
- If a 5 is in the top-left or bottom-right corner, it is transformed into 1.
- If a 5 is in the middle, it is transformed into 2.
- If a 5 is connected to another 5, it is transformed into 2.
- If a 5 is not connected to another 5, it is transformed into 1.

From these examples, we can observe a pattern:
- The value `5` in the input is transformed to `3` in the output.
- The value `0` in the input remains `0` in the output.
- The value `3` in the output appears in positions where the input had `5` or `0` in a specific pattern.

Given this pattern, we can infer that the transformation rule is:
- Replace all `5`s with `3`s.
- Leave all `0`s unchanged.
- The transformation does not affect other values directly but seems to follow a specific pattern related to the positions of `5`s and `0`s.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting the grid across the vertical line that separates the 4th and 5th columns. Additionally, the reflected part of the grid is mirrored horizontally. This means that the values to the right of the 4th column are mirrored to the left of the 4th column, and vice versa. The values in the 4th column remain unchanged.

Let's break down the transformation:
1. Identify the 4th column as the dividing line.
2. Reflect the values to the right of the 4th column to the left side.
3. Mirror the reflected values horizontally.

For example, in Example 1, the values to the right of the 4th column are [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] which are mirrored to the left side as [4, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting and rotating the colors around the central square. Specifically, the colors seem to be mirrored and rotated 90 degrees clockwise around the central square of the input grid. The central square itself remains unchanged. Additionally, the colors that are reflected and rotated are the ones that are not zero.

Let's break down the transformation rule:
1. Identify the central square of the input grid.
2. Reflect the colors around the central square.
3. Rotate the reflected colors 90 degrees clockwise.
4. The central square and the surrounding zeros remain unchanged.

For Example 1:
- The central square is (3,3) with value 8.
- The colors around it are reflected and rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

For Example 2:
- The central square is (2,2) with value 1.
- The colors around it are reflected and rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

For Example 3:
- The central square is (3,3) with value 2.
- The colors around it are reflected and rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

Applying this rule to the test case should give us the correct output.

2. **Color 5** is transformed into **2** when it is in the interior of a contiguous block of 5s.

   - Observation: The border color (8) is replaced with 5, and the inner colors are shifted inward by one layer.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
1. Replace the border color with the smallest color value in the grid.
2. Shift the inner colors inward by one layer.

Now, applying this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```

[9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9],
[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

The smallest color value in the grid is 0. Therefore, the border color (9) will be replaced with 0, and the inner colors will be shifted inward by one layer.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting the non-zero values (representing colored squares) diagonally down-right. Specifically, each non-zero value in the input grid is moved one step down and one step to the right in the output grid. If a value is moved out of the grid boundaries, it is not included in the output. Additionally, the transformation seems to stop when it reaches the bottom row or the rightmost column.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
1. The '5' at position (0, 2) moves to (1, 3).
2. The '5' at position (1, 8) moves to (2, 9), but since it's out of bounds, it is not included.
3. The '2' at position (6, 2) moves to (7, 3).
4. The '2' at position (7, 2) moves to (8, 3).
5. The '5' at position (9, 2) moves to (10, 3), but since it's out of bounds, it is not included.
6. The '5' at position (6, 7) moves to (7, 8).

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing the value '5' with a sequence of numbers based on its position and the surrounding values. Specifically:
- The first occurrence of '5' in a row or column is replaced with '1'.
- The second occurrence of '5' in a row or column is replaced with '2'.
- The third occurrence of '5' in a row or column is replaced with '3'.
- The fourth occurrence of '5' in a row or column is replaced with '4'.
- If a '5' is surrounded by other '5's, it seems to be replaced with a '4' if it is the last in a sequence of '5's.

Additionally, the transformation seems to propagate the changes to adjacent cells, but only if they are '0'. This means that '0' cells adjacent to transformed '5' cells are also transformed based on the surrounding values.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has dimensions 23x17.
   - The output grid has dimensions 7x6.
   - The output grid seems to be a simplified version of the input grid, where each cell in the output grid represents a 3x3 block of the input grid.
   - The transformation rule appears to be based on the majority color in each 3x3 block. If the majority of the colors in a 3x3 block are the same, that color is used in the output grid. If there is a tie, the rule is not immediately clear from the examples provided.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has dimensions 26x23.
   - The output grid has dimensions 9x9.
   - Similar to Example 1, the output grid seems to be a simplified version of the input grid, where each cell in the output grid represents a 3x3 block of the input grid.
   - The transformation rule appears to be based on the majority color in each 3x3 block.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid has dimensions 16x17.
   - The output grid has dimensions 6x8.
   - Similar to the previous examples, the output grid seems to be a simplified version of the input grid, where each cell in the output grid represents a 3x3 block of the input grid.
   - The transformation rule appears to be based on the majority color in each 3x3 block.

Given these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- Divide the input grid into 3x3 blocks.
- For each 3x3 block, determine the majority color.
- If there is a tie, the rule is not immediately clear, but it seems to favor certain colors over others.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting the grid across the horizontal line that separates the two halves of the grid. This reflection seems to occur only for the rows above the row of 5s. The rows below the row of 5s remain unchanged. Additionally, the transformation seems to involve wrapping the top and bottom rows around to the opposite ends of the grid.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Identify the row of 5s as the dividing line.
2. Reflect the rows above this line across the horizontal axis.
3. Wrap the top row to the bottom and the bottom row to the top.
4. The row of 5s remains unchanged.
5. The rows below the row of 5s remain unchanged.

By applying these steps to the test case, we can determine the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying unique patterns or sequences in the input grid and mapping them to specific values in the output grid. Let's break down the examples to identify the pattern:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has a repeating pattern of `0, 0, 4` and a central row with `1, 4, 3`.
   - The output grid seems to map the central row's unique values to specific positions.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has a repeating pattern of `0, 0, 0, 3` and a central row with `2, 3, 8`.
   - The output grid maps the central row's unique values to specific positions.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid has a repeating pattern of `0, 0, 1` and a central row with `6, 3`.
   - The output grid maps the central row's unique values to specific positions.

4. **Example 4**:
   - The input grid has a repeating pattern of `0, 0, 0, 8` and a central row with `1, 2, 8`.
   - The output grid maps the central row's unique values to specific positions.

From these examples, it seems that the transformation rule involves:
- Identifying the unique values in the central row of the input grid.
- Mapping these unique values to specific positions in the output grid.

For the test case, we need to identify the unique values in the central row and map them to the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve removing the central column (the 5th column) and the top and bottom rows from the input grid. The resulting grid is then shifted to the right by one column. This transformation is consistent across all the provided examples.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
1. Remove the central column (the 5th column).
2. Remove the top and bottom rows.
3. Shift the remaining grid to the right by one column.

From these examples, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- The output grid is a 4x4 grid.
- The transformation seems to involve identifying the positions of the color `1` in the input grid and marking them as `2` in the output grid.
- The positions of `3` in the input grid are marked as `0` in the output grid.
- The positions of `0` in the input grid are marked as `0` in the output grid.
- The positions of `1` in the input grid are marked as `2` in the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise and then shifting the colors to the left. Specifically, the transformation involves:
1. Rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2. Shifting the colors to the left, such that the color that was in the rightmost column of the original grid moves to the leftmost column in the output grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:
1. Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2. Shift the colors to the left.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting certain colors (represented by integers) to the right. Specifically, it seems that each color is shifted to the right by a certain number of positions, and this shift is consistent for each color across different examples.

From the examples provided:
- In Example 1, the color 3 is shifted to the right by 1 position, and the color 4 is shifted to the right by 2 positions.
- In Example 2, the color 2 is shifted to the right by 1 position, and the color 1 is shifted to the right by 1 position.
- In Example 3, the color 8 is shifted to the right by 1 position, and the color 1 is shifted to the right by 1 position.

The transformation rule seems to be:
- For each color, shift it to the right by a specific number of positions.
- If a color is shifted out of the grid, it wraps around to the left side of the grid.

Given this rule, we can apply it to the test case.

From these examples, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- The transformation involves shifting the non-zero values upwards until they hit a boundary or another non-zero value.
- The value `8` appears to be a placeholder for the boundary or the end of the shift.
- The transformation seems to stop shifting when it encounters a `2` or a `3`.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the bounding box of the non-zero elements in the input grid and then creating a smaller grid that represents the relative positions of these non-zero elements within that bounding box. The output grid is then filled with the corresponding non-zero values from the input grid, while the rest of the grid is filled with zeros.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Identify the bounding box of the non-zero elements in the input grid.
2. Create a new grid with dimensions based on the size of the bounding box.
3. Map the non-zero elements from the input grid to the corresponding positions in the new grid.
4. Fill the rest of the new grid with zeros.

For Example 1:
- The bounding box of the non-zero elements (2s) is from (2, 3) to (5, 5).
- The output grid is 4x4, and the non-zero elements are mapped accordingly.

For Example 2:
- The bounding box of the non-zero elements (1s) is from (1, 1) to (4, 4).
- The output grid is 5x3, and the non-zero elements are mapped accordingly.

For Example 3:
- The bounding box of the non-zero elements (8s) is from (3, 4) to (5, 6).
- The output grid is 3x5, and the non-zero elements are mapped accordingly.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing each non-zero value in the input grid with a pattern that alternates between the original value and a fixed value (5). This pattern starts immediately to the right of the original value and continues to the end of the row. Additionally, the transformation only affects the row containing the non-zero value and the rows directly below it.

Let's break down the examples:

- In Example 1, the value 2 in the third row is transformed into a pattern [2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5] in the output.
- In Example 2, the value 2 in the second row is transformed into a pattern [2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5] in the output.
- In Example 3, the value 8 in the fourth row is transformed into a pattern [8, 5, 8, 5, 8] in the output.

The pattern seems to be that for each non-zero value, the transformation rule is to alternate the value with 5 to the right of the original value until the end of the row. This pattern is applied to all rows below the row containing the non-zero value.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the unique non-zero colors in the input grid and then creating a smaller grid that represents the relative positions of these colors. The output grid seems to be a 3x3 grid where each cell contains the color value that appears in the corresponding position in the input grid, but only considering the non-zero values.

To determine the output grid:
1. Identify the unique non-zero colors in the input grid.
2. Create a 3x3 grid where each cell contains the color value that appears in the corresponding position in the input grid, but only considering the non-zero values.

The transformation rule appears to involve extracting a specific sub-grid from the input grid and then transforming it into a smaller grid. The key observations are:

1. The output grid is always a smaller sub-grid of the input grid.
2. The transformation seems to involve removing rows and columns that contain only zeros or a specific color (e.g., 0 or 3 in the examples).
3. The transformation also involves removing rows and columns that contain only a specific color (e.g., 8 in Example 1, 2 in Example 2, 1 in Example 3).
4. The transformation seems to involve removing rows and columns that contain only a specific color (e.g., 8 in Example 1, 2 in Example 2, 1 in Example 3) and then removing rows and columns that contain only a specific color (e.g., 0 or 3 in the examples).

By analyzing the examples, we can see that the transformation rule involves removing rows and columns that contain only a specific color (e.g., 8 in Example 1, 2 in Example 2, 1 in Example 3) and then removing rows and columns that contain only a specific color (e.g., 0 or 3 in the examples). The remaining sub-grid is then transformed into the output grid.

For the test case, we need to identify the specific color that is used to remove rows and columns. In this case, the specific color is 1. We then remove rows and columns that contain only 1 and then remove rows and columns that contain only 3. The remaining sub-grid is then transformed into the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting the input grid across both the horizontal and vertical axes. Specifically, the output grid is constructed by:
1. Taking the original input grid.
2. Adding a reflection of the input grid across the horizontal axis (flipping it upside down).
3. Adding a reflection of the input grid across the vertical axis (flipping it left to right).
4. Adding a reflection of the input grid across both the horizontal and vertical axes (flipping it both upside down and left to right).

This results in a 2x2 grid of the original input grid, where each quadrant is a reflection of the original grid in a different orientation.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding the colored regions (non-zero values) in a specific manner. Observing the examples, we can see that the transformation involves:
1. **Expanding the colored regions**: Each non-zero value in the input grid seems to expand to fill a larger area in the output grid.
2. **Symmetry**: The expansion often maintains a symmetrical pattern around the original non-zero values.
3. **Boundary Conditions**: The expansion does not go beyond the boundaries of the grid.

Let's analyze the examples:
- In Example 1, the '7' and '4' values expand to form larger symmetrical shapes.
- In Example 2, the '6' values expand to form a larger symmetrical shape.
- In Example 3, the '8' and '9' values expand to form larger symmetrical shapes.

Given these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves expanding the non-zero values in a symmetrical manner while respecting the grid boundaries.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing certain values in the grid based on specific conditions. By examining the examples, we can infer the following:

1. **Preservation of 0s and 5s**: The values 0 and 5 remain unchanged in the output grid.
2. **Transformation of 2s**: The value 2 is transformed into 2 in the output grid, but it seems to affect the surrounding cells.
3. **Transformation of other values**: Other values (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) are not present in the examples, so we can assume they are not part of the transformation rule.

From the examples, it seems that the value 2 in the input grid affects the surrounding cells in the output grid. Specifically, it changes the surrounding cells to 2 if they are not already 0 or 5.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
- If a cell contains a 2, it will remain 2.
- If a cell is adjacent to a 2 (up, down, left, right), it will be transformed to 2 unless it is already 0 or 5.

The transformation rule appears to involve duplicating the columns of the input grid to create the output grid. Specifically, each column in the input grid is repeated twice to form the corresponding columns in the output grid. Additionally, the number of rows in the output grid remains the same as the input grid.

Let's analyze the examples:

- Example 1: The input grid has 6 columns. The output grid has 12 columns, with each column from the input grid repeated twice.
- Example 2: The input grid has 7 columns. The output grid has 14 columns, with each column from the input grid repeated twice.
- Example 3: The input grid has 8 columns. The output grid has 16 columns, with each column from the input grid repeated twice.

Given this pattern, the test case input grid has 9 columns. Therefore, the output grid should have 18 columns, with each column from the input grid repeated twice.

The transformation rule appears to be that each row in the input grid is transformed into a row where all elements are replaced by the most frequent color (integer value) in that row. This is evident from the examples provided:

- In Example 1, the most frequent colors in each row are 1, 8, 3, and 2. The output grid reflects this by replacing all elements in each row with the most frequent color from that row.
- In Example 2, the most frequent colors in each row are 2 and 8. The output grid reflects this by replacing all elements in each row with the most frequent color from that row.
- In Example 3, the most frequent colors in each row are 3, 7, 8, and 1. The output grid reflects this by replacing all elements in each row with the most frequent color from that row.

2. Replace all 5s with 0s.
3. Replace all 2s with 2s.
4. Replace all 1s with 0s.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding the input grid into a larger grid where each cell in the input grid is represented by a 3x3 block in the output grid. The value of the cell in the input grid determines the values in the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid. Specifically, each non-zero value in the input grid seems to be surrounded by zeros in the output grid, creating a distinct pattern.

For example, in Example 1, the input value '2' at position (0,0) corresponds to a 3x3 block in the output grid where the center cell is '2' and the surrounding cells are '0'. Similarly, the input value '4' at position (0,3) corresponds to a 3x3 block in the output grid where the center cell is '4' and the surrounding cells are '0'.

Additionally, the output grid seems to be padded with rows and columns of zeros to maintain a consistent size. The transformation also seems to handle overlapping 3x3 blocks by merging them appropriately.

Given this pattern, we can apply the same transformation to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting the non-zero values upwards and to the left, while preserving the zero values in their positions. Specifically, for each column, the non-zero values are moved upwards until they reach the top of the column or encounter another non-zero value. Similarly, for each row, the non-zero values are moved to the left until they reach the leftmost position of the row or encounter another non-zero value.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:

The transformation rule appears to involve the propagation of certain colors (represented by integers) from their initial positions to adjacent cells. Specifically, the rule seems to be:

1. If a cell contains a color (other than the border color, which is consistently 2 in the test case), it propagates to the right and downwards until it hits another color or the border.
2. The propagation stops when it encounters a cell that is already filled with a different color or the border color.
3. The propagation does not affect the cells above or to the left of the starting cell.

Let's apply this rule to the test case to determine the output.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the positions of the non-zero values in the input grid and then creating a new grid where these positions are used to determine the values in the output grid. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve:

1. Identifying the positions of the non-zero values in the input grid.
2. Creating a new grid where the values at these positions are propagated horizontally and vertically to form lines of the same value.
3. The value at the intersection of these lines is determined by a specific rule, which seems to be the sum of the values at the intersection points, modulo 10.

For example, in Example 1, the non-zero values 8 and 7 are used to create horizontal and vertical lines in the output grid. The intersection of these lines is determined by the sum of the values at the intersection points, modulo 10.

In Example 2, the same rule is applied, with the non-zero values 8 and 7 creating horizontal and vertical lines in the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the unique colors (non-zero integers) in each row of the input grid and then determining the most frequent color in each row. The output grid seems to be a list of the most frequent colors in each row, but only for rows that contain non-zero values.

Let's analyze the examples:

- **Example 1**: The input grid has rows with colors 3, 1, 4, 2, and 8. The most frequent colors in each row are 3, 1, 4, 2, and 8 respectively. The output grid lists these colors in the order they appear.

- **Example 2**: The input grid has rows with colors 6, 8, 2, 1, and 6. The most frequent colors in each row are 6, 1, 2, 8, and 6 respectively. The output grid lists these colors in the order they appear.

- **Example 3**: The input grid has rows with colors 3, 1, 8, 2, and 3. The most frequent colors in each row are 3, 8, 2, 1, and 3 respectively. The output grid lists these colors in the order they appear.

- **Example 4**: The input grid has rows with colors 1, 2, 8, 4, and 1. The most frequent colors in each row are 8, 2, 4, 1, and 8 respectively. The output grid lists these colors in the order they appear.

Based on this pattern, the transformation rule is to identify the most frequent non-zero color in each row of the input grid and list these colors in the order they appear in the input grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

The most frequent non-zero colors in each row are:

The transformation rule appears to involve several steps:

1. **Horizontal and Vertical Duplication**: Each row and column in the input grid is duplicated multiple times to form the initial part of the output grid. The number of times a row or column is duplicated seems to be related to the number of rows and columns in the input grid.

2. **Zero Padding**: After the duplicated rows and columns, the remaining part of the output grid is filled with zeros. The number of rows and columns added as zeros seems to be related to the size of the input grid.

3. **Pattern Observation**: By observing the examples, we can see that the output grid is formed by repeating the input grid's rows and columns in a specific pattern. The pattern seems to be that each element in the input grid is repeated in a way that forms a larger grid.

For the test case, the input grid is:
```
[
[0, 0, 8],
[0, 8, 0],
[0, 0, 0]
]
```

Following the observed pattern, we can deduce the output grid by duplicating the rows and columns and then adding the necessary zeros.

The transformation rule appears to involve converting the color 5 in the input grid to a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 for each new contiguous block of 5s. The transformation also seems to handle the placement of these numbers based on the position and connectivity of the 5s in the input grid.

Let's break down the transformation rule:
1. Identify all contiguous blocks of 5s in the input grid.
2. Assign a unique number starting from 1 to each contiguous block of 5s.
3. Replace all 5s in each block with the assigned number.
4. Ensure that the numbering starts from 1 and increments by 1 for each new block of 5s.

By observing the examples, we can see that the numbering is consistent and follows the connectivity of the 5s. For instance, in Example 1, the first block of 5s is replaced with 1, the second block with 2, and so on.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values with zeros and then repeating the pattern of the remaining values. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve:
1. Replacing all occurrences of the value 0 with a repeating pattern of the surrounding values.
2. Removing all occurrences of the value 0 from the grid.
3. Repeating the pattern of the remaining values to fill in the grid.

Let's analyze the examples to confirm this rule:

- In Example 1, the input grid has several zeros, and the output grid has these zeros replaced with a repeating pattern of the surrounding values.
- In Example 2, the same pattern is observed.
- In Example 3, the same pattern is observed.

Given this rule, we can apply it to the test case to determine the output.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the unique colors (non-zero integers) in each input grid and then creating an output grid where each row contains these unique colors in a specific order. The order seems to be from top to bottom and left to right, but only considering the unique colors that appear in the input grid.

Let's analyze the examples:

- Example 1: The unique colors are 3, 4, 6, and 8. The output grid has rows of [4, 6, 8].
- Example 2: The unique colors are 4 and 9. The output grid has rows of [9, 4].
- Example 3: The unique color is 2. The output grid has rows of [2].
- Example 4: The unique color is 8. The output grid has rows of [8].
- Example 5: The unique colors are 2 and 3. The output grid has rows of [2, 3].
- Example 6: The unique colors are 1, 4, and 8. The output grid has rows of [1, 4, 8].

From this pattern, we can infer that the transformation rule is to identify the unique non-zero integers in the input grid and create an output grid where each row contains these unique colors in the order they first appear from top to bottom and left to right.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the unique colors (non-zero integers) in the input grid and then creating a smaller grid where each element represents the unique colors found in the corresponding row of the input grid. The output grid seems to be constructed by taking the unique colors from each row of the input grid and placing them in a new grid where each row corresponds to a unique row in the input grid.

Let's break down the examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input has unique colors in rows: [8, 7], [3, 4, 1], [2, 5]
  - Output: [[8, 7], [3, 4, 1], [2, 5]]

- **Example 2:**
  - Input has unique colors in rows: [2, 8], [1, 4]
  - Output: [[2, 8], [1, 4]]

- **Example 3:**
  - Input has unique colors in rows: [8, 2], [3], [4, 1]
  - Output: [[8, 2], [3], [4, 1]]

The transformation rule seems to be:
1. Identify the unique non-zero integers in each row of the input grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve extracting a sub-grid from the input grid and then rotating it 90 degrees clockwise. The sub-grid is defined by the non-zero values in the input grid. The output grid is then formed by placing this rotated sub-grid into a new grid, with the top-left corner of the rotated sub-grid aligned with the top-left corner of the output grid.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the non-zero values form a sub-grid that, when rotated 90 degrees clockwise, matches the output grid.
2. In Example 2, the non-zero values form a sub-grid that, when rotated 90 degrees clockwise, matches the output grid.
3. In Example 3, the non-zero values form a sub-grid that, when rotated 90 degrees clockwise, matches the output grid.

The size of the output grid is determined by the dimensions of the rotated sub-grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying distinct shapes or patterns within the input grid and then outputting a simplified representation of these shapes. Specifically, the rule seems to focus on the outermost boundaries of these shapes, ignoring the internal structure.

In each example, the output grid is a smaller grid that represents the boundary of the largest shape in the input grid. The boundary is defined by the outermost occurrences of each color, and the internal structure is ignored.

For instance, in Example 1, the input grid has a large 'X' shape made of 6s, and the output grid represents the boundary of this 'X' shape. Similarly, in Example 2, the input grid has a large 'X' shape made of 7s, and the output grid represents the boundary of this 'X' shape.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the positions of the colored squares (represented by the number 5) and then placing specific numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) around these positions in a consistent pattern. Specifically, the numbers 1 and 2 seem to be placed diagonally above and below the 5s, while the numbers 3 and 4 seem to be placed diagonally to the left and right of the 5s. This pattern is consistent across all the examples provided.

Let's break down the pattern:
- For each 5 in the input grid, place a 1 diagonally above and to the left.
- For each 5 in the input grid, place a 2 diagonally above and to the right.
- For each 5 in the input grid, place a 3 diagonally below and to the left.
- For each 5 in the input grid, place a 4 diagonally below and to the right.

This pattern ensures that the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 are placed in a consistent manner around each occurrence of the number 5 in the input grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Color Reduction**: The output grids have fewer colors (only 0 and 3) compared to the input grids (0 to 10).
2. **Pattern Recognition**: The output grids seem to focus on specific patterns or structures within the input grids.
3. **Boundary and Edge Detection**: The transformation appears to highlight certain boundaries or edges within the input grids.

By examining the examples, we can infer the following:
- The value '3' in the output grid seems to correspond to the presence of the color '5' in the input grid, particularly at the boundaries or edges.
- The value '0' in the output grid seems to correspond to areas where '5' is not present or not at the boundary.

Given these observations, the transformation rule likely involves detecting the presence of the color '5' at the boundaries or edges and converting it to '3' in the output grid, while all other areas are converted to '0'.

</reasoning>

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0],
[7, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0],
[7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5]
]
```

Applying the transformation rule:
- Identify the presence of '5' at the boundaries or edges.
- Convert these areas to '3' in the output grid.
- All other areas are converted to '0'.

Test Case Output:
```

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a central '6' shape surrounded by '8's.
   - The output grid has a '3' border around the '6' shape, and the '6' shape itself is transformed into a '4' shape in the center.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid has a more complex shape with '6's and '8's.
   - The output grid has a '3' border around the '6' shapes, and the '6' shapes are transformed into '4' shapes in the center.

From these observations, we can infer the following transformation rules:
- Any '8' that is adjacent to a '6' in the input grid is transformed into a '3' in the output grid.
- Any '6' in the input grid is transformed into a '4' in the output grid.
- Any '8' that is not adjacent to a '6' remains an '8'.

Let's apply these rules to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the largest contiguous block of a single color (excluding the color 0, which seems to represent the background or empty space) and then creating an output grid where each cell is filled with the color of this largest block. The output grid is a smaller grid that fits the largest block of color.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the largest block of color is the 8s, which form a 3x3 square. The output is a 3x3 grid of 8s.
2. In Example 2, the largest block of color is the 1s, which form a 3x3 square. The output is a 3x3 grid of 1s.
3. In Example 3, the largest block of color is the 6s, which form a 3x2 rectangle. The output is a 3x2 grid of 6s.
4. In Example 4, the largest block of color is the 7s, which form a 4x4 square. The output is a 4x4 grid of 7s.
5. In Example 5, the largest block of color is the 4s, which form a 2x2 square. The output is a 2x2 grid of 4s.

Given this pattern, we can apply the same rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the values of the input grid based on the presence of specific values (1s) in the input grid. Specifically, the rule seems to be:

1. For each row in the input grid, if there is at least one '1', the corresponding row in the output grid will have '2's in the same positions as the '1's in the input grid.
2. The transformation only affects the first row of the output grid if there is a '1' in the first row of the input grid.
3. If there is a '1' in the second row of the input grid, the second row of the output grid will have '2's in the same positions as the '1's in the input grid.
4. If there is a '1' in the third row of the input grid, the third row of the output grid will have '2's in the same positions as the '1's in the input grid.

By observing the examples, we can see that the transformation rule is consistent with these observations. For example, in Example 1, there is a '1' in the second row of the input grid, and the output grid has a '2' in the same position. In Example 2, there are '1's in the first and second rows of the input grid, and the output grid has '2's in the same positions. In Example 3, there is a '1' in the first and third rows of the input grid, and the output grid has '2's in the same positions.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input is a 9x9 grid.
   - Output is a 5x5 grid.
   - The output grid seems to be a central 5x5 section of the input grid, but with some values shifted.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input is a 9x11 grid.
   - Output is a 5x7 grid.
   - Similar to Example 1, the output grid appears to be a central section of the input grid, but with some values shifted.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input is a 11x13 grid.
   - Output is a 5x5 grid.
   - Again, the output grid seems to be a central section of the input grid, but with some values shifted.

From these observations, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- The output grid is a 5x5 section of the input grid.
- The central 5x5 section of the input grid is taken.
- The values in the output grid are shifted to the right by one position, and the first column is filled with the values from the last column of the input grid.

The transformation rule appears to shift non-zero values downwards by one row. This is evident in all the provided examples. For instance, in Example 1, the '3' and '4' move down by one row. The same pattern is observed in all other examples. Therefore, the transformation rule is to move each non-zero value down by one row, while keeping the zero values in their original positions.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in certain areas with a specific color based on the presence of other colors in the input grid. Let's analyze the examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input has a small cluster of '2's and a single '1'. The output fills the entire row below the '1' with '1's.
2. **Example 2**: The input has a cluster of '8's and a single '3'. The output fills the entire column to the left of the '3' with '3's.
3. **Example 3**: The input has a cluster of '3's and a single '2'. The output fills the entire column below the '2' with '2's.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the value of certain cells based on their proximity to the color represented by the number 8. Specifically, if a cell is adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a cell with the value 8, it is transformed into the value 3. This transformation does not affect cells that are not adjacent to an 8.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:
1. Identify all cells with the value 8.
2. For each cell with the value 8, check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
3. If an adjacent cell does not already have the value 8, change its value to 3.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has several '8's scattered throughout.
   - The output grid has '8's only in the first two rows and the last row, with some '8's removed from the middle rows.
   - This suggests that the transformation might involve removing '8's that are not in specific rows or columns.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has several '6's.
   - The output grid has '6's only in specific rows and columns, with some '6's removed from the middle rows and columns.
   - This suggests that the transformation might involve removing '6's that are not in specific rows or columns.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid has several '5's.
   - The output grid has '5's only in specific rows and columns, with some '5's removed from the middle rows and columns.
   - This suggests that the transformation might involve removing '5's that are not in specific rows or columns.

4. **Example 4**:
   - The input grid has several '4's.
   - The output grid has '4's only in specific rows and columns, with some '4's removed from the middle rows and columns.
   - This suggests that the transformation might involve removing '4's that are not in specific rows or columns.

From these observations, it seems that the transformation rule involves removing all instances of a specific color (represented by a number) except for those in the first and last rows and columns. This rule applies to all examples provided.

For the test case, we need to apply this rule to the number '3'.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting non-zero values upwards until they either hit the top of the grid or another non-zero value. This is evident from the examples provided:

- In Example 1, the '2' and '4' values shift upwards until they hit the top of the grid or another non-zero value.
- In Example 2, the '2', '4', and '1' values shift upwards similarly.
- In Example 3, the '2', '1', and '4' values shift upwards until they hit the top of the grid or another non-zero value.

The transformation does not affect the zero values, and the non-zero values do not change their relative positions horizontally, only vertically.

From these examples, we can infer the following transformation rule:
1. The value `7` in the input grid is transformed into `7` in the output grid.
2. The value `0` in the input grid is transformed into `8` in the output grid if it is adjacent to a `7` (either horizontally or vertically).
3. The value `0` in the input grid is transformed into `0` in the output grid if it is not adjacent to a `7`.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

**Test Case:**
- Input:
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```

Applying the transformation rule:
- The `7`s remain `7`.
- The `0`s adjacent to `7`s become `8`.
- The `0`s not adjacent to `7`s remain `0`.

The resulting output grid is:

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: A grid with '8' and '2' scattered.
   - Output: A 3x3 grid with '8' and '0' in a specific pattern.
   - Observation: The output seems to focus on the '8' and '2' values, ignoring others.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: A grid with '4' and '1' scattered.
   - Output: A 3x3 grid with '4' and '0' in a specific pattern.
   - Observation: Similar to Example 1, the output focuses on '4' and '1'.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: A grid with '8' and '6' scattered.
   - Output: A 3x3 grid with '8' and '0' in a specific pattern.
   - Observation: Again, the output focuses on '8' and '6'.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves:
- Identifying the highest value in the input grid.
- Creating a 3x3 output grid where the highest value and its surrounding values are mapped to specific positions.
- The highest value in the input grid is mapped to the center of the 3x3 output grid.
- The surrounding values are mapped to the edges of the 3x3 output grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

Test Case Analysis:
- The highest value in the test case is '8'.
- The surrounding values are '2' and '3'.

   - The output grid is a 7x7 grid, which seems to be a cropped and transformed version of the input grid.
   - The transformation appears to focus on the central part of the input grid, ignoring the borders.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid has a central structure with various colors (1, 2, 8).
   - The output grid is a 7x7 grid, similar to Example 1.
   - The transformation again focuses on the central part of the input grid.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input grid has a central structure with various colors (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8).
   - The output grid is a 7x7 grid, similar to the previous examples.
   - The transformation focuses on the central part of the input grid.

From these observations, we can infer the following transformation rule:

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

**Example 1:**
- The input grid has several distinct regions of colors.
- The output grid seems to have removed some of the outer layers of colors, particularly the 8s and 0s, and retained the inner regions of 3s.

**Example 2:**
- The input grid has regions of 2s and 1s.
- The output grid has removed the outer layers of 2s and 1s, retaining the inner regions of 2s.

From these observations, it appears that the transformation rule involves removing the outermost layers of colors, particularly the boundary colors, and retaining the inner regions. The transformation seems to focus on the most frequent color in the inner regions.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
- Identify the outermost layers of colors.
- Remove these layers.
- Retain the inner regions of the most frequent color.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding the input grid into a larger grid by shifting the values diagonally down and to the right, while filling the remaining spaces with zeros. Specifically, each row of the input grid is transformed into multiple rows in the output grid, with the values shifting one position to the right and down in each subsequent row. The number of rows in the output grid is equal to the number of rows in the input grid plus the number of columns in the input grid minus one.

For example, in Example 1, the input grid is 3x3, and the output grid is 6x6. The values from the input grid are shifted diagonally down and to the right, with zeros filling in the remaining spaces.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
Input:
[
[0, 0, 3],

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in the squares to the right of and below each non-zero value in the input grid with the same value. This means that for each non-zero value in the input grid, all squares to its right and below it in the output grid will be filled with that value. The transformation does not affect the squares above or to the left of any non-zero value.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:
1. Identify all non-zero values in the input grid.
2. For each non-zero value, fill in all squares to its right and below with the same value.

The transformation rule appears to involve two main steps:

1. **Propagation**: Each non-zero value in the input grid propagates to its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) in the output grid. This means if a cell has a value `x` in the input, then the cells directly adjacent to it (up, down, left, right) in the output will also have the value `x`.

2. **Boundary Handling**: The propagation stops at the boundaries of the grid. If a cell is on the edge or corner of the grid, it will not propagate beyond the grid's boundaries.

By observing the examples, we can see that the transformation rule is consistent with these steps. For instance, in Example 1, the value `2` in the input grid propagates to its neighboring cells in the output grid. Similarly, in Example 2, the value `2` and `8` propagate to their neighboring cells.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has several blocks of colors.
   - The output grid seems to have these blocks shifted to the right and down.
   - Specifically, the blocks of colors are moved to the rightmost and bottommost positions they can occupy without overlapping other blocks.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Similar to Example 1, the blocks of colors are shifted to the right and down.
   - The blocks are moved to the rightmost and bottommost positions they can occupy.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Again, the blocks of colors are shifted to the right and down.
   - The blocks are moved to the rightmost and bottommost positions they can occupy.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Each block of the same color is moved to the rightmost and bottommost position it can occupy without overlapping other blocks.
- The movement is such that the blocks are pushed to the right and down, filling the grid from the bottom-right corner upwards and leftwards.

</reasoning>

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

```

Applying the transformation rule:
- The block of 6s moves to the top-left corner.
- The block of 1s moves to the rightmost and bottommost position it can occupy without overlapping other blocks.
- The block of 4s moves to the rightmost and bottommost position it can occupy without overlapping other blocks.
- The block of 7s moves to the rightmost and bottommost position it can occupy without overlapping other blocks.
- The block of 2s moves to the rightmost and bottommost position it can occupy without overlapping other blocks.
- The block of 3s moves to the rightmost and bottommost position it can occupy without overlapping other blocks.

The transformation rule appears to involve mapping the input values to new values based on specific patterns or conditions. By examining the examples, we can infer the following:

1. The value `3` in the input is consistently transformed to `1` in the output.
2. The value `0` in the input is consistently transformed to `0` in the output.
3. There are additional transformations that seem to depend on the context or surrounding values. For example, in Example 1, the value `3` in the input is transformed to `6` in the output when it is part of a larger connected component of `3`s.

Given these observations, we can hypothesize that the transformation rule involves:
- Directly mapping `3` to `1` and `0` to `0`.
- Transforming `3` to `6` when it is part of a larger connected component of `3`s.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values in the input grid with the value 8, while keeping others as 0. The pattern seems to be that the corners and the edges of the grid are transformed into 8s, while the inner squares remain 0s. The number of 8s on the edges increases with the size of the grid. Specifically, the top and bottom rows are completely filled with 8s, and the first and last columns are also filled with 8s, except for the corners which are already filled. The inner part of the grid remains 0s.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values with a new value (8) based on specific conditions. Observing the examples, we can see that the value 8 is introduced in the output grids where there are specific patterns of the value 5 in the input grids. Specifically, the value 8 seems to be placed in positions that are adjacent to the value 5 in the input grid, but not directly adjacent to another 5. This suggests a rule where 8 is placed in positions that are ""isolated"" from other 5s but still adjacent to them.

Let's break down the rule:
1. If a cell contains a 5 and is adjacent to at least one cell containing a 0, then the adjacent 0 cells are replaced with 8.
2. If a cell contains a 5 and is adjacent to at least one cell containing a 0, then the adjacent 0 cells are replaced with 8.
3. If a cell contains a 5 and is adjacent to at least one cell containing a 0, then the adjacent 0 cells are replaced with 8.

By applying this rule to the test case, we can determine the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding each colored square into a 3x3 block of the same color, with the exception of the bottom-right corner of the input grid, which is expanded into a 4x4 block. The output grid is then a 9x9 grid, where each 3x3 block corresponds to a single square in the input grid. The bottom-right corner of the input grid corresponds to a 4x4 block in the output grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
- The input grid is a 3x3 grid.
- The output grid will be a 9x9 grid.
- Each square in the input grid will be expanded into a 3x3 block in the output grid, except for the bottom-right corner, which will be expanded into a 4x4 block.

The transformation rule appears to involve spreading the color values (represented by integers) from their original positions to adjacent cells. Specifically, the color values seem to spread both horizontally and vertically. Here are the key observations:

1. **Horizontal Spread**: The color values spread to the left and right from their original positions.
2. **Vertical Spread**: The color values spread upwards and downwards from their original positions.
3. **Priority**: The color value 2 seems to have a higher priority and spreads more aggressively, often replacing other colors.
4. **Boundary Conditions**: The spread stops at the boundaries of the grid or when it encounters another color value.

By applying these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule and apply it to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve spreading the non-zero values (colors) from their initial positions in a specific pattern. Let's analyze the examples to identify the pattern:

1. **Example 1**: The value `4` and `2` spread diagonally upwards to the right.
2. **Example 2**: The value `3` spreads diagonally upwards to the right.
3. **Example 3**: The value `6` spreads diagonally upwards to the right.
4. **Example 4**: The value `7` spreads diagonally upwards to the right, and the value `2` spreads diagonally upwards to the right.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is to spread the non-zero values diagonally upwards to the right until they reach the top or the right edge of the grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values with the number 3, while leaving other values unchanged. Specifically, the number 3 seems to replace 0s that are adjacent to 2s or 8s in a specific pattern. Let's analyze the examples to identify the pattern:

1. In Example 1, the 0s adjacent to 2s or 8s are replaced with 3s, except for the 0s in the bottom-left corner.
2. In Example 2, the 0s adjacent to 2s or 8s are replaced with 3s, except for the 0s in the bottom-left corner.
3. In Example 3, the 0s adjacent to 2s or 8s are replaced with 3s, except for the 0s in the bottom-left corner.

The pattern seems to be that 0s are replaced with 3s if they are adjacent to 2s or 8s, but not if they are in the bottom-left corner of the grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve several steps:

1. **Row Duplication**: Each row in the input grid is duplicated to form two consecutive rows in the output grid. This is evident from the pattern where each row in the input grid corresponds to two identical rows in the output grid.

2. **Column Duplication**: Each column in the input grid is duplicated to form two consecutive columns in the output grid. This is evident from the pattern where each column in the input grid corresponds to two identical columns in the output grid.

3. **Zero Handling**: Zeros in the input grid are handled differently. They are replaced by the value 1 in the output grid. This is evident from the examples where zeros in the input grid are transformed into ones in the output grid.

4. **Boundary Handling**: The boundaries of the grid are handled by extending the pattern to the edges. This is evident from the examples where the edges of the grid are extended to maintain the pattern.

By applying these steps, we can transform the input grid into the output grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a mix of 0s, 2s, and 8s. The output is a single 0. This suggests that the presence of 0s in the input grid might be significant.
2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a mix of 0s, 2s, and 8s. The output is a single 8. This suggests that the presence of 8s in the input grid might be significant.
3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a mix of 0s, 2s, and 8s. The output is a single 8. This suggests that the presence of 8s in the input grid might be significant.
4. **Example 4**: The input grid has a mix of 0s, 2s, and 8s. The output is a single 0. This suggests that the presence of 0s in the input grid might be significant.
5. **Example 5**: The input grid has a mix of 0s, 2s, and 8s. The output is a single 8. This suggests that the presence of 8s in the input grid might be significant.
6. **Example 6**: The input grid has a mix of 0s, 2s, and 8s. The output is a single 0. This suggests that the presence of 0s in the input grid might be significant.

From these observations, it appears that the transformation rule is based on the presence of the color 8 in the input grid. If the grid contains any 8s, the output is a single 8. If the grid does not contain any 8s, the output is a single 0.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Grid Size Reduction**: The output grids are smaller than the input grids. Specifically, the output grids are 3x3, while the input grids are 5x5.
2. **Color Transformation**: The values in the output grids are either 0 or 5. This suggests a binary transformation based on the presence or absence of certain colors in the input grid.
3. **Pattern Recognition**: By examining the examples, we can see that the output grid seems to represent a simplified version of the input grid, focusing on the presence of specific colors in certain positions.

Let's break down the transformation rule:
- The output grid is a 3x3 grid.
- The value 5 in the output grid corresponds to the presence of a specific color in the input grid.
- The value 0 in the output grid corresponds to the absence of that specific color.

By comparing the input and output grids, we can infer that the transformation rule involves checking the presence of a specific color in the input grid and mapping it to the output grid.

For the test case, we need to determine the presence of the specific color (likely the color represented by 1 in this case) and map it to the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the highest value in the input grid and then creating an output grid where the highest value is used to form a border around the grid. The interior of the grid is then filled with the highest value, with some exceptions where the highest value is not present in the input grid.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Identify the highest value in the input grid.
2. Create an output grid where the highest value forms a border.
3. Fill the interior of the output grid with the highest value, except where the highest value is not present in the input grid.

For Example 1:
- The highest value is 4.
- The output grid has a border of 4s and the interior is filled with 4s, except where there are 0s in the input grid.

For Example 2:
- The highest value is 3.
- The output grid has a border of 3s and the interior is filled with 3s, except where there are 0s in the input grid.

For Example 3:
- The highest value is 3.
- The output grid has a border of 2s and the interior is filled with 2s, except where there are 0s in the input grid.

For the test case:
- The highest value is 8.
- The output grid should have a border of 8s and the interior should be filled with 8s, except where there are 0s in the input grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain '0' values with '1' values based on the presence of '8' values in specific patterns. Specifically, '0' values are transformed into '1' values if they are directly below an '8' value in the previous row. This transformation seems to propagate downwards and to the right, affecting subsequent rows and columns.

Let's analyze the examples to confirm this pattern:

- In Example 1, the '8' values in the input grid are transformed into '1' values in the output grid, starting from the fourth row and propagating downwards.
- In Example 2, the '8' values in the input grid are transformed into '1' values in the output grid, starting from the seventh row and propagating downwards.
- In Example 3, the '8' values in the input grid are transformed into '1' values in the output grid, starting from the seventh row and propagating downwards and to the right.

Based on this observation, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows: For each '0' value in the grid, if there is an '8' value directly above it in the previous row, transform the '0' value into a '1' value. This transformation propagates downwards and to the right.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting and rotating the input grid to produce the output grid. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve a 90-degree rotation and then a reflection across the vertical axis.

Let's break down the transformation rule:
1. **Rotation**: Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2. **Reflection**: Reflect the rotated grid across the vertical axis.

By applying these steps to the input grids in the examples, we can see that the output grids match the described transformation.

For the test case, we will apply the same transformation rule:
1. Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2. Reflect the rotated grid across the vertical axis.

2. Replace all instances of that color in the output grid with the color 5.
3. Replace all instances of the color 5 in the output grid with the color that appears in the middle row and the columns adjacent to it.

14. Replace all instances of the color 10 in the output grid with the color that appears in the middle row and the columns adjacent to it.

In the test case, the color that appears in the middle row and the columns adjacent to it is 4. Therefore, we should replace all instances of the color 4 in the output grid with the color 5.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding the input grid into a larger grid by replicating and mirroring the input grid's elements. Specifically, the output grid is three times the height and width of the input grid. The transformation seems to follow these steps:

1. The output grid is initialized with zeros.
2. The input grid is mirrored and replicated to fill the output grid.
3. The mirrored and replicated grids are placed in specific positions to form the final output grid.

For example, in Example 1, the input grid is:
```
[0, 8]
[0, 0]
[0, 8]
```
The output grid is:
```
[8, 0, 0, 8]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 0, 0, 8]
[8, 0, 0, 8]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 0, 0, 8]
[8, 0, 0, 8]

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in the gaps within a shape to create a solid block of the same color. Specifically, the rule seems to be:
1. Identify the outermost boundary of a shape formed by a color.
2. Fill in all the empty spaces (0s) within this boundary with the same color.
3. Leave the boundary of the shape unchanged.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
- The shape in the test case is a cross-like structure with the color 6.
- The outermost boundary of this shape is already defined by the color 6.
- We need to fill in the empty spaces within this boundary with the color 6.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1 and Example 6**: Both have the same output [1]. The input grids have a central square of 0 and the rest of the squares are 5 or 4 respectively. This suggests that the transformation might be counting the number of unique colors in the grid.

2. **Example 2 and Example 3**: Both have the output [2]. The input grids have a central square of 8 or 5 and the rest of the squares are 0 or 5 respectively. This further supports the idea that the transformation is counting the number of unique colors.

3. **Example 4 and Example 5**: Both have the output [3]. The input grids have a central square of 8 or 1 and the rest of the squares are 0 or 1 respectively. This also supports the idea that the transformation is counting the number of unique colors.

4. **Example 7**: The output is [6]. The input grid has a central square of 5 and the rest of the squares are 0 or 5. This suggests that the transformation is counting the number of unique colors.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to be counting the number of unique colors in the input grid and outputting that number as a single-element list.

From the examples, we can observe the following pattern:
- The top-left 3x3 sub-grid of the output is filled with the highest values from the input grid, starting from the top-left corner and moving right and down.
- The middle 3x3 sub-grid of the output is filled with the next highest values, and so on.
- The bottom-right 3x3 sub-grid of the output is filled with the lowest values, including zeros.

The transformation rule appears to involve the propagation of the color 5 (or the number 5) in a specific pattern. Let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the input has three 5s, and the output shows a pattern where 5s and 1s are arranged in a specific way. The 5s seem to propagate outward from their original positions, and 1s appear to fill in the gaps between them.

2. In Example 2, the input has four 5s, and the output shows a similar pattern of propagation. The 5s and 1s form a more complex pattern, but the basic idea of propagation and filling in gaps with 1s remains consistent.

The pattern seems to involve:
- Propagating the 5s outward in a diagonal and horizontal/vertical manner.
- Filling in the gaps between the propagated 5s with 1s.

Given this observation, we can apply the same rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding each non-zero value in the input grid into a 4x4 block of the same value in the output grid. The position of the top-left corner of this 4x4 block corresponds to the position of the non-zero value in the input grid. Additionally, the output grid is larger to accommodate these 4x4 blocks, and the rest of the grid is filled with zeros.

Let's break down the transformation rule:
1. For each non-zero value in the input grid, create a 4x4 block of the same value in the output grid.
2. The top-left corner of this 4x4 block in the output grid corresponds to the position of the non-zero value in the input grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve reducing the 3x3 grid to a 1x3 grid by selecting specific elements from each 3x3 sub-grid. The rule seems to be:
1. Take the top-left element of the 3x3 sub-grid.
2. Take the center element of the 3x3 sub-grid.
3. Take the bottom-right element of the 3x3 sub-grid.

This pattern is consistent across the provided examples. Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1],
     [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [2, 2, 0],
     [2, 2, 3],
     [0, 0, 2]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output grid seems to be a 3x3 grid where each cell contains the maximum value from a corresponding 2x2 sub-grid in the input.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],

   - Output:
     ```
     [

   - Observation: The output grid is a 2x3 grid where each cell contains the maximum value from a corresponding 3x3 sub-grid in the input.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:

   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [5, 5],
     [5, 5],
     [6, 6]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output grid is a 3x2 grid where each cell contains the maximum value from a corresponding 2x3 sub-grid in the input.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The output grid is smaller than the input grid.
- Each cell in the output grid contains the maximum value from a corresponding sub-grid in the input grid.
- The size of the sub-grid in the input corresponds to the size of the output grid.

</reasoning>

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Input:
```
[
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]
```

The output grid should be a 3x3 grid where each cell contains the maximum value from a corresponding 2x2 sub-grid in the input.

Let's calculate the output:

- Top-left 2x2 sub-grid: max(1, 1, 1, 1) = 1
- Top-middle 2x2 sub-grid: max(1, 1, 1, 2) = 2
- Top-right 2x2 sub-grid: max(1, 1, 2, 3) = 3
- Middle-left 2x2 sub-grid: max(1, 1, 1, 1) = 1
- Middle-middle 2x2 sub-grid: max(1, 1, 2, 3) = 3
- Middle-right 2x2 sub-grid: max(1, 1, 1, 1) = 1
- Bottom-left 2x2 sub-grid: max(1, 1, 1, 1) = 1
- Bottom-middle 2x2 sub-grid: max(1, 1, 1, 1) = 1
- Bottom-right 2x2 sub-grid: max(1, 1, 1, 1) = 1

Therefore, the output grid is:

The transformation rule appears to involve spreading the color (represented by the integer value) from the bottom-right corner of the grid upwards and to the left. Specifically, the color seems to spread to the left and upwards from the bottom-right corner, filling in the grid with the color value of 8, and then changing to the value of 4 when it reaches the top or left edge.

Let's break down the transformation rule:
1. Identify the color value at the bottom-right corner of the grid.
2. Spread this color value upwards and to the left, filling in the grid.
3. When the spread reaches the top or left edge, change the color value to 4.
4. Continue spreading the color value of 8 until it reaches the top or left edge, then change to 4.

This rule is consistent across all the examples provided. Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has several non-zero values scattered throughout.
   - The output grid has zeros everywhere except for a specific pattern in the middle rows and columns.
   - The pattern in the output seems to be related to the presence of non-zero values in the input grid.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has non-zero values in various positions.
   - The output grid has a similar pattern to Example 1, with non-zero values concentrated in specific rows and columns.
   - The pattern seems to be influenced by the presence of non-zero values in the input grid.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid has non-zero values in various positions.
   - The output grid has a pattern similar to the previous examples, with non-zero values concentrated in specific rows and columns.
   - The pattern seems to be influenced by the presence of non-zero values in the input grid.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves identifying the presence of non-zero values in the input grid and then creating a specific pattern in the output grid based on these values. The pattern seems to be a ""bounding box"" around the non-zero values, with the bounding box filled with a specific value (e.g., 2 in the examples).

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
- Identify the bounding box around the non-zero values in the input grid.
- Fill the bounding box in the output grid with the value 2.
- Leave the rest of the output grid as zeros.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a central vertical line of 8s and a central horizontal line of 3s.
   - The output grid seems to be a 2D projection of the input grid, focusing on the central vertical and horizontal lines.
   - The output grid is smaller, suggesting a reduction in size while retaining key features.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Similar to Example 1, the input grid has a central vertical line of 8s and a central horizontal line of 3s.
   - The output grid again seems to be a 2D projection, focusing on the central vertical and horizontal lines.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input grid has a central vertical line of 8s and a central horizontal line of 3s.
   - The output grid is a 2D projection, focusing on the central vertical and horizontal lines.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves:
   - Identifying the central vertical and horizontal lines of 8s and 3s.
   - Projecting these lines onto a smaller grid.
   - Retaining the colors (integer values) from the input grid but in a reduced form.

The transformation seems to involve:
   - Removing the top and bottom rows and the left and right columns.
   - Keeping the central vertical and horizontal lines.
   - Reducing the grid size while retaining the key features.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting the input grid and then appending it to the bottom of the original grid. Specifically, the output grid is created by:
1. Taking the original input grid.
2. Reflecting the input grid vertically (i.e., flipping it upside down).
3. Appending the reflected grid to the bottom of the original grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case to see if it holds.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling the grid with a border of a specific color (3 in all examples) and then transforming the inner non-zero values based on their positions and values. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve:
1. Filling the entire grid with the color 3.
2. For each non-zero value in the input grid, the output grid is modified as follows:
   - If a non-zero value is surrounded by zeros, it is expanded to include its neighboring cells.
   - The expansion seems to be based on the value itself, where higher values might expand more than lower values.
   - The expansion does not seem to affect the border of color 3.

By observing the examples, we can see that the transformation rule involves expanding the non-zero values into a larger connected component while maintaining the border of color 3.

The transformation rule appears to involve removing isolated or disconnected colored squares and keeping only the largest connected components of each color. Let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has several disconnected squares of color 7. The output grid retains only the largest connected component of color 7 and removes all other isolated or disconnected squares.

2. In Example 2, the input grid has several disconnected squares of color 6. The output grid retains only the largest connected component of color 6 and removes all other isolated or disconnected squares.

3. In Example 3, the input grid has several disconnected squares of color 5. The output grid retains only the largest connected component of color 5 and removes all other isolated or disconnected squares.

Based on this observation, the transformation rule seems to be:
- Identify the largest connected component for each color.
- Remove all other isolated or disconnected squares of that color.
- Retain the largest connected component.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting the input grid across both the vertical and horizontal axes, and then repeating the pattern to fill the entire grid. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve the following steps:

1. Identify the non-zero elements in the input grid.
2. Reflect these elements across both the vertical and horizontal axes.
3. Fill the rest of the grid with a repeating pattern based on the reflected elements.

Let's analyze the examples:

- **Example 1**: The input grid has a diagonal pattern of 2, 8, 3. The output grid repeats this pattern in a checkerboard fashion.
- **Example 2**: The input grid has a diagonal pattern of 1, 2, 4. The output grid repeats this pattern in a checkerboard fashion.
- **Example 3**: The input grid has a diagonal pattern of 8, 3, 4. The output grid repeats this pattern in a checkerboard fashion.

Given this pattern, we can infer that the transformation rule involves reflecting the non-zero elements and then filling the grid with a repeating pattern based on these reflected elements.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain colors (integers) with other colors based on specific patterns or conditions. Let's analyze the examples to identify the rule:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has colors 8 and 9.
   - The output grid has colors 8 and 9, but with some additional changes:
     - The 9s are replaced with 8s in certain positions.
     - The 8s are replaced with 9s in certain positions.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has colors 2 and 7.
   - The output grid has colors 2 and 7, but with some additional changes:
     - The 7s are replaced with 2s in certain positions.
     - The 2s are replaced with 7s in certain positions.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid has colors 3 and 4.
   - The output grid has colors 3 and 4, but with some additional changes:
     - The 4s are replaced with 3s in certain positions.
     - The 3s are replaced with 4s in certain positions.

From these observations, it seems that the transformation rule involves replacing one color with another based on specific conditions. Specifically, it appears that the transformation involves replacing a color with another color in a way that creates a pattern or symmetry.

For the test case, we need to apply a similar transformation rule. The input grid has colors 1, 6, and 0. We need to determine how these colors are transformed.

Given the patterns in the examples, it seems that the transformation involves replacing 6s with 1s and 1s with 6s in certain positions. Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Grid Size Reduction**: The output grids are smaller than the input grids. Specifically, the output grids are 4x4, while the input grids vary in size but seem to be reduced to a 4x4 grid.

2. **Color Mapping**: The colors (integers) in the output grids appear to be derived from specific positions in the input grids. Let's examine the patterns:

   - In Example 1, the output grid seems to be derived from specific columns and rows of the input grid.
   - In Example 2, the output grid also seems to follow a similar pattern but with different starting points.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: By comparing the input and output grids, we can infer that the transformation involves selecting specific elements from the input grid and mapping them to the output grid. The pattern seems to involve selecting elements from the input grid in a specific order and then mapping them to the output grid.

4. **Consistency**: The transformation rule must be consistent across all examples. By observing the examples, we can see that the output grid is derived from the input grid by selecting elements in a specific order and mapping them to the output grid.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule likely involves selecting specific elements from the input grid and mapping them to the output grid in a 4x4 format. The specific elements selected seem to follow a pattern that involves selecting elements from specific rows and columns of the input grid.

</reasoning>

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 9, 0, 9, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0],
[4, 4, 0, 4, 2, 9, 9, 9, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 4, 4, 0, 2, 9, 0, 9, 9, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

By observing the pattern from the examples, we can infer that the output grid is derived by selecting specific elements from the input grid. The pattern seems to involve selecting elements from specific rows and columns of the input grid and mapping them to the output grid in a 4x4 format.

Let's apply this pattern to the test case:

1. Select the first element from the first row and column of the input grid.
2. Select the second element from the second row and column of the input grid.
3. Continue this pattern until the output grid is filled.

Applying this pattern, we get the following output grid:

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in gaps in the input grid with the same color as the nearest non-zero value above it. Additionally, there seems to be a rule that extends the color to the right and downwards when a non-zero value is encountered. Let's break down the transformation rule based on the given examples:

1. **Filling Gaps**: If a cell is zero and there is a non-zero value directly above it, the cell takes the value of the cell above it.
2. **Extending Colors**: If a non-zero value is encountered, it extends to the right and downwards until it hits another color or the edge of the grid.
3. **Boundary Conditions**: The transformation does not affect the boundaries of the grid unless specified by the rules above.

Let's apply these rules to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a large block of 8s with a smaller block of 2s and a single 4.
   - The output grid has a similar structure but with some changes:
     - The top-left corner has a pattern of 8s and 1s.
     - The middle section has a pattern of 2s, 4s, and 1s.
     - The bottom section has a pattern of 2s and 4s.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid has a large block of 3s with a smaller block of 1s and a single 2.
   - The output grid has a similar structure but with some changes:
     - The top-left corner has a pattern of 3s and 2s.
     - The middle section has a pattern of 1s and 2s.
     - The bottom section has a pattern of 3s and 8s.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input grid has a large block of 1s with a smaller block of 6s and a single 8.
   - The output grid has a similar structure but with some changes:
     - The top-left corner has a pattern of 1s, 3s, and 6s.
     - The middle section has a pattern of 6s, 3s, and 8s.
     - The bottom section has a pattern of 1s, 3s, and 6s.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves:
- Replacing certain colors with a pattern of other colors.
- The pattern seems to depend on the position and the surrounding colors.

Given these observations, let's apply the transformation rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the positions of the non-zero values in the input grid and then mapping these positions to a smaller grid. The output grid seems to be a 2D representation of the positions of the non-zero values in the input grid, where the value in the output grid corresponds to the value in the input grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has non-zero values at specific positions.
   - The output grid is a 4x4 grid where each cell corresponds to a specific position in the input grid.
   - The value in the output grid is the value from the input grid at the corresponding position.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has non-zero values at specific positions.
   - The output grid is a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a specific position in the input grid.
   - The value in the output grid is the value from the input grid at the corresponding position.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid has non-zero values at specific positions.
   - The output grid is a 2x2 grid where each cell corresponds to a specific position in the input grid.
   - The value in the output grid is the value from the input grid at the corresponding position.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves:
1. Identifying the positions of the non-zero values in the input grid.
2. Mapping these positions to a smaller grid.
3. The value in the output grid corresponds to the value in the input grid at the corresponding position.

For the test case, we need to identify the positions of the non-zero values and map them to a smaller grid. The output grid will have the same dimensions as the number of unique non-zero values in the input grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in the grid with a specific pattern around the non-zero values (which represent colored squares). Specifically, the transformation seems to involve:
1. Identifying the positions of the non-zero values in the input grid.
2. For each non-zero value, filling in a surrounding area with the value 1, except where another non-zero value or the boundary of the grid is present.
3. The non-zero values themselves remain unchanged in the output grid.

By examining the examples, we can see that the value 1 is used to fill in the areas around the non-zero values, creating a sort of ""border"" or ""halo"" effect around them. The non-zero values themselves are preserved in their original positions.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve spreading the non-zero values (colors) from the input grid to the output grid in a specific pattern. Let's analyze the examples to identify the pattern:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input has '8' values at specific positions.
   - The output has '8' values spreading out from these positions in a diagonal and vertical pattern.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input has '2' values at specific positions.
   - The output has '2' values spreading out from these positions in a diagonal and vertical pattern, but with a different density and pattern compared to Example 1.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input has '3' values at specific positions.
   - The output has '3' values spreading out from these positions in a diagonal and vertical pattern, with a different density and pattern compared to Examples 1 and 2.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves spreading the non-zero values in a diagonal and vertical pattern, with the density and pattern varying based on the specific value.

For the test case, we need to apply this spreading pattern to the '4' values in the input grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the color of certain squares based on their position relative to other squares of the same color. Specifically, it seems that squares of color 8 are being transformed into color 2 under certain conditions. By examining the examples, we can infer the following pattern:

1. If a square of color 8 is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to another square of color 8, it remains 8.
2. If a square of color 8 is not adjacent to another square of color 8, it is transformed into color 2.

This rule is applied to all squares in the grid, and the transformation is consistent across all examples provided.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has a structure where the non-zero values are concentrated in the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner.
   - The output grid seems to be a smaller grid that captures the essential structure of the input grid, focusing on the non-zero values.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has a more scattered distribution of non-zero values.
   - The output grid is smaller and seems to capture the central non-zero values, ignoring the outer zeros.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid has a similar structure to Example 1, with non-zero values concentrated in specific areas.
   - The output grid captures the essential structure of the input grid, focusing on the non-zero values.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves:
   - Identifying the non-zero values in the input grid.
   - Creating a smaller grid that captures the essential structure of the non-zero values.
   - Ignoring the outer zeros and focusing on the central non-zero values.

Given this rule, let's apply it to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the positions of the non-zero values (in this case, the value 5) in the input grid and then creating a new grid where each non-zero value in the input grid is replaced by a 1 in the output grid. The transformation also seems to involve filling in a 3x3 block around each non-zero value in the input grid with 1s in the output grid. The 1s in the output grid are then surrounded by 0s.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
1. Identify the positions of the non-zero values (5s) in the input grid.
2. For each non-zero value, create a 3x3 block of 1s centered around that value in the output grid.
3. Ensure that the 1s do not overlap with other 1s from different non-zero values.
4. Fill the rest of the grid with 0s.

The transformation rule appears to involve swapping the colors (integer values) in a specific pattern. Observing the examples, we can see that the transformation involves swapping the values in a checkerboard pattern. Specifically, each value is swapped with the value that would be in the same position if the grid were rotated 180 degrees.

For example, in Example 1, the input grid has a pattern of 6 and 7 alternating, and the output grid has the same pattern but shifted. The same applies to Example 2 and Example 3, where the values are swapped in a checkerboard pattern.

To apply this rule to the test case, we need to swap the values in a checkerboard pattern. This means that for each position (i, j) in the grid, if i + j is even, the value remains the same. If i + j is odd, the value is swapped with the value at position (i, j) in the rotated grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting the non-zero values across the vertical midline of the grid. This means that for each row, the values to the right of the center are mirrored to the left side, and vice versa. Additionally, the transformation seems to ensure that the grid maintains its original dimensions and that the mirrored values do not overlap with existing values.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:
1. Identify the non-zero values in each row.
2. Reflect these values across the vertical midline.
3. Ensure the grid dimensions remain the same.

For the given test case:
- The first two rows are all zeros, so they remain unchanged.
- The third row has a single '2' in the middle, which will be reflected to the other side.
- The fourth and fifth rows have values that need to be reflected across the midline.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding the input grid into a larger grid while maintaining the relative positions of the non-zero elements. Specifically, the output grid is a 3x3 expansion of the input grid, with the original elements shifted to the right and down by two positions. The rest of the grid is filled with zeros.

Let's break down the transformation:
1. The output grid is always a 9x9 grid.
2. The non-zero elements from the input grid are placed in the output grid such that their positions are shifted two rows down and two columns to the right from their original positions.
3. The rest of the grid is filled with zeros.

The transformation rule appears to involve several steps:

1. **Border Identification**: The output grid seems to have a border of a specific color (e.g., 3 in Example 1, 2 in Example 2, 6 in Example 3). This border is likely derived from the input grid's outermost layer.

2. **Central Region Extraction**: The central region of the output grid is derived from the central region of the input grid. This region is typically a smaller grid within the input grid, excluding the outermost layer.

3. **Color Mapping**: The colors in the central region of the output grid are mapped from the colors in the central region of the input grid. This mapping seems to involve replacing certain colors with others based on a specific rule.

4. **Size Reduction**: The output grid is smaller than the input grid, typically by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.

Let's apply these steps to the test case:

1. **Border Identification**: The border color in the test case is likely to be 4, as it is the most frequent color in the outermost layer of the input grid.

2. **Central Region Extraction**: The central region of the input grid is a 12x12 grid (excluding the outermost layer).

3. **Color Mapping**: The colors in the central region of the output grid are mapped from the colors in the central region of the input grid. The mapping rule is not immediately clear, but we can infer it from the examples.

4. **Size Reduction**: The output grid will be a 6x6 grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in gaps between non-zero values to create contiguous blocks of the same color. Specifically, for each color, if there are isolated squares or gaps between squares of the same color, these gaps are filled in to create a contiguous block. This is evident in all three examples provided.

In Example 1, the color 3 is transformed into a contiguous block. In Example 2, the colors 1 and 4 are transformed into contiguous blocks. In Example 3, the colors 6 and 8 are transformed into contiguous blocks.

The transformation does not affect the zero values, which remain unchanged. The transformation also does not affect the positions of the non-zero values; it only fills in the gaps between them.

Given this rule, we can apply it to the test case to determine the output.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding the input grid into a larger grid where each element from the input grid is placed diagonally in the output grid. The output grid is larger than the input grid, and the size of the output grid depends on the number of elements in the input grid. Specifically, the output grid has dimensions (n x 2n - 1) where n is the number of elements in the input grid.

For each element in the input grid, the corresponding element in the output grid is placed such that it starts from the top-left corner and moves diagonally down to the right. The rest of the elements in the output grid are filled with zeros.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
Input: [0, 6, 7, 8, 9]

The output grid will have dimensions (5 x 9) because there are 5 elements in the input grid.

The elements will be placed diagonally as follows:
- 0 will be at position (0, 0)
- 6 will be at position (1, 1)
- 7 will be at position (2, 2)
- 8 will be at position (3, 3)
- 9 will be at position (4, 4)

The rest of the elements will be filled with zeros.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying contiguous blocks of non-zero values in the input grid and then creating a new grid where each row represents a unique color (non-zero value) from the input grid. The output grid seems to be constructed by taking the maximum contiguous block of each color from the input grid and placing it in a new row.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Identify all unique non-zero values in the input grid.
2. For each unique non-zero value, find the largest contiguous block of that value in the input grid.
3. Create a new row in the output grid for each unique non-zero value, where the row contains the largest contiguous block of that value.

By applying this rule to the test case, we can determine the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding the colored regions in a specific manner. Observing the examples, we can see that the transformation involves:
1. Expanding the colored regions outward by one layer of the surrounding color.
2. The expansion seems to occur in a way that the new layer of color surrounds the original colored region.

Let's break down the examples to understand the pattern:
- In Example 1, the central 4s expand to include 6s, and the 6s expand to include 4s.
- In Example 2, the central 2s expand to include 7s, and the 7s expand to include 2s.
- In Example 3, the central 3s expand to include 1s, and the 1s expand to include 3s.

The transformation rule seems to be:
1. Identify the central colored region.
2. Expand this region outward by one layer of the surrounding color.
3. Repeat the process for the new layer.

Applying this rule to the test case, we need to expand the colored regions outward by one layer of the surrounding color.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting the non-zero values across the central horizontal line of the grid. Additionally, the central row (or rows) of the input grid are repeated multiple times in the output grid. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify the central row(s)**: The central row(s) contain the non-zero values.
2. **Reflect the values**: Reflect the non-zero values across the central horizontal line.
3. **Repeat the central row(s)**: The central row(s) are repeated multiple times in the output grid.

For Example 1:
- The central row is `[8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- Reflecting this row gives `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 8]`.
- The output grid has this reflected row repeated multiple times.

For Example 2:
- The central rows are `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0]` and `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- Reflecting these rows gives `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0]` and `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- The output grid has these reflected rows repeated multiple times.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The central row is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- Reflecting this row gives `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- The output grid will have this reflected row repeated multiple times.

   - Observation: The output grid has a '5' in the position of the highest value in the input grid, and '0' elsewhere.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is:
- Replace the highest value in the input grid with '5'.
- Replace all other values with '0'.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying specific patterns or shapes within the input grid and then mapping these patterns to a smaller output grid. The output grid seems to be a simplified representation of the input grid, focusing on certain key features.

Key observations:
1. The output grid is always smaller than the input grid.
2. The output grid seems to highlight specific patterns or shapes from the input grid.
3. The transformation rule appears to be consistent across different examples.

Let's analyze the examples to identify the patterns:
- In Example 1, the output grid highlights a cross-like pattern with the number 2.
- In Example 2, the output grid highlights a checkerboard-like pattern with the numbers 4 and 8.
- In Example 3, the output grid highlights a specific pattern with the numbers 2 and 8.
- In Example 4, the output grid highlights a specific pattern with the numbers 1 and 3.

Given these observations, the transformation rule likely involves identifying and simplifying specific patterns or shapes within the input grid. The test case input grid has a similar structure to the examples, with distinct patterns of the number 3 and other numbers. The output grid should highlight these patterns in a simplified form.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in certain patterns around the existing colors. Specifically, it seems to involve adding a color (4) around the existing colors in a specific pattern. The color 4 is added in a way that it surrounds the existing colors and fills in gaps. The pattern seems to be that the color 4 is added in a way that it creates a border around the existing colors and fills in any empty spaces that are adjacent to the existing colors.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the color 6 is surrounded by the color 4, and the color 4 is added in a way that it creates a border around the color 6.
2. In Example 2, the color 7 is surrounded by the color 4, and the color 4 is added in a way that it creates a border around the color 7.
3. In Example 3, the color 3 is surrounded by the color 4, and the color 4 is added in a way that it creates a border around the color 3.

Based on this pattern, we can infer that the transformation rule is to add the color 4 around the existing colors in a way that it creates a border around them and fills in any empty spaces that are adjacent to the existing colors.

The transformation rule appears to involve removing rows and columns that are entirely composed of a single color (represented by a single integer value). The remaining grid is then the output. This is evident from the examples provided:

- In Example 1, the input grid has rows and columns of 8s and 3s. The output grid removes the rows and columns of 8s, leaving only the unique pattern of 3s and 4s.
- In Example 2, the input grid has rows and columns of 4s and 2s. The output grid removes the rows and columns of 4s, leaving only the unique pattern of 2s and 1s.
- In Example 3, the input grid has rows and columns of 3s and 1s. The output grid removes the rows and columns of 3s, leaving only the unique pattern of 1s and 8s.

Given this pattern, the test case should be transformed by removing rows and columns that are entirely composed of 1s, leaving only the unique patterns.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

**Example 1:**
- The input grid has a central square of color 4, surrounded by colors 7, 8, and 6.
- The output grid is a 3x3 grid where the central square is 4, and the surrounding squares are 7, 8, and 6.

**Example 2:**
- The input grid has a central square of color 2, surrounded by colors 1, 3, 5, and 6.
- The output grid is a 3x3 grid where the central square is 2, and the surrounding squares are 1, 3, 5, and 6.

From these observations, it appears that the transformation rule involves extracting a 3x3 sub-grid from the center of the input grid. The central square of this sub-grid becomes the central square of the output grid, and the surrounding squares of the sub-grid become the surrounding squares of the output grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting the input grid across both the horizontal and vertical axes to create a larger grid. Specifically, the output grid is created by:
1. Reflecting the input grid horizontally to create a mirrored version.
2. Reflecting the input grid vertically to create another mirrored version.
3. Combining these reflections to form a larger grid that is symmetric both horizontally and vertically.

From these examples, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- The output is a single row of integers.
- The length of the output row is 5.
- The output seems to be derived from the top-left 5x5 sub-grid of the input.
- The transformation involves counting the occurrences of non-zero values in each row of the 5x5 sub-grid and then mapping these counts to a binary representation (1 for non-zero, 0 for zero).

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Input:
```

[1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 2, 2, 0, 0]

```

Counting non-zero values in each row:
- Row 1: 0 non-zero values
- Row 2: 3 non-zero values
- Row 3: 2 non-zero values
- Row 4: 0 non-zero values
- Row 5: 2 non-zero values

Mapping these counts to a binary representation:
- 0 -> 0
- 3 -> 1
- 2 -> 1
- 0 -> 0
- 2 -> 1

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Input Grid Dimensions**: The input grid is transformed into a smaller output grid. The output grid dimensions are not immediately obvious, but we can infer that the output grid is a 9x9 grid based on the examples provided.

2. **Color Transformation**: Each integer value in the input grid represents a color, and these values are transformed into new values in the output grid. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain colors with new colors based on their positions and possibly their surrounding colors.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: By comparing the input and output grids, we can observe patterns:
   - The output grid seems to be a compressed version of the input grid, focusing on specific regions or boundaries.
   - Certain colors in the input grid are mapped to specific colors in the output grid.

4. **Boundary and Region Analysis**: The output grid appears to highlight boundaries and regions of specific colors from the input grid. For example, in Example 1, the output grid seems to focus on the boundaries and regions of colors 5, 2, and 3.

5. **Color Mapping**: By comparing the input and output grids, we can infer a mapping of colors. For instance, color 5 in the input grid often maps to color 5 in the output grid, but other colors may map to different colors based on their positions.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule likely involves:
   - Compressing the input grid into a 9x9 output grid.
   - Mapping specific colors to new colors based on their positions and surrounding colors.
   - Highlighting boundaries and regions of specific colors.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values in the input grid with the value 2, while keeping other values unchanged. Specifically, the value 5 in the input grid is replaced with the value 2 in the output grid, but only if it is not in the first row or the first column. Additionally, the value 5 in the first row or the first column remains unchanged.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In Example 1, the value 5 in the first row and first column remains unchanged, but the value 5 in the fourth row and eighth row is replaced with 2.
- In Example 2, the value 5 in the first row and first column remains unchanged, but the value 5 in the third row, fifth row, and seventh row is replaced with 2.
- In Example 3, the value 5 in the first row and first column remains unchanged, but the value 5 in the third row, fourth row, seventh row, and ninth row is replaced with 2.

Based on this pattern, the transformation rule is to replace the value 5 with 2 if it is not in the first row or the first column.

The transformation rule appears to involve rotating the grid 180 degrees. This is evident from the examples provided:

- In Example 1, the bottom-right 4x4 section of the input grid becomes the top-left 4x4 section of the output grid, and vice versa.
- In Example 2, the same pattern is observed, with the bottom-right 4x4 section of the input grid becoming the top-left 4x4 section of the output grid, and vice versa.

Given this observation, the transformation rule is to rotate the grid 180 degrees.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in the grid with a specific pattern around the non-zero values. Specifically, it seems that for each non-zero value in the input grid, the output grid is filled with the value 1 in the surrounding cells, except for the cells that are already non-zero or are on the boundary of the grid. The non-zero values themselves remain unchanged. Additionally, the transformation seems to propagate the value 1 outward from the non-zero values until it reaches the boundary of the grid or another non-zero value.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:
1. Identify all non-zero values in the input grid.
2. For each non-zero value, fill the surrounding cells with the value 1, except for the cells that are already non-zero or are on the boundary of the grid.
3. The non-zero values themselves remain unchanged.
4. Propagate the value 1 outward from the non-zero values until it reaches the boundary of the grid or another non-zero value.

The transformation rule appears to involve spreading the non-zero values (colors) both upwards and downwards from their original positions. The spread seems to be symmetric and extends to the edges of the grid. Additionally, the spread stops when it encounters another non-zero value or the edge of the grid.

Let's break down the examples:

1. In Example 1, the value `2` at position (1, 4) spreads upwards and downwards, filling the column from (0, 4) to (4, 4). The value `8` at position (10, 4) spreads upwards and downwards, filling the column from (7, 4) to (10, 4).

2. In Example 2, the values `3` and `1` at positions (6, 0) and (6, 12) respectively spread upwards and downwards, filling the columns from (4, 0) to (6, 0) and (4, 12) to (6, 12).

3. In Example 3, the values `5` and `8` at positions (5, 3) and (5, 16) respectively spread upwards and downwards, filling the columns from (3, 3) to (5, 3) and (3, 16) to (5, 16).

Based on this observation, the transformation rule is to spread each non-zero value both upwards and downwards until it encounters another non-zero value or the edge of the grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

**Example 1:**
- Input:
  ```
  [
  [2, 1, 2, 1, 2],
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [2, 1, 2, 1, 2],
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 2, 1, 2]
  ]
  ```
- Output:
  ```
  [
  [1, 1],
  [2, 1]
  ]
  ```
  The output seems to be a 2x2 grid where each cell represents the most frequent color in each 2x2 block of the input grid.

**Example 2:**
- Input:
  ```
  [
  [8, 6, 0, 6],
  [6, 8, 6, 8],
  [8, 6, 8, 6],
  [6, 8, 6, 8]
  ]
  ```
- Output:
  ```
  [
  [8]
  ]
  ```
  The output is a 1x1 grid where the cell represents the most frequent color in the entire input grid.

**Example 3:**
- Input:
  ```
  [
  [2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2],
  [2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2],

  [2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2],
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0],
  [2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```
- Output:
  ```
  [
  [5, 5],
  [5, 2]
  ]
  ```
  The output is a 2x2 grid where each cell represents the most frequent color in each 2x2 block of the input grid.

From these examples, it appears that the transformation rule involves dividing the input grid into 2x2 blocks (or smaller if the grid dimensions are not divisible by 2) and then determining the most frequent color in each block. The output grid dimensions are determined by the number of 2x2 blocks that fit into the input grid.

</reasoning>

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case Input:**
```
[
[8, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],

[8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8],
[1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1],
[8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8],
[8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8]
]
```

We can divide this 7x7 grid into 2x2 blocks and determine the most frequent color in each block.

- Block 1 (top-left 2x2):
  ```
  [
  [8, 1],
  [1, 8]
  ]
  ```
  Most frequent color: 8

- Block 2 (top-right 2x2):
  ```
  [
  [8, 8],
  [8, 1]
  ]
  ```
  Most frequent color: 8

- Block 3 (bottom-left 2x2):
  ```
  [
  [8, 8],
  [1, 8]
  ]
  ```
  Most frequent color: 8

- Block 4 (bottom-right 2x2):
  ```
  [
  [8, 8],
  [8, 1]
  ]
  ```
  Most frequent color: 8

- Block 5 (center 2x2):
  ```
  [
  [8, 8],
  [8, 8]
  ]
  ```
  Most frequent color: 8

- Block 6 (bottom-center 2x2):
  ```
  [
  [8, 8],
  [8, 8]

  ```
  Most frequent color: 8

- Block 7 (bottom-right 2x2):
  ```
  [
  [8, 8],
  [8, 8]
  ]
  ```
  Most frequent color: 8

The output grid will be a 3x3 grid (since the input grid is 7x7 and we can fit 3x3 2x2 blocks):

The transformation rule appears to involve rotating the non-zero elements of the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise and then shifting them downwards. Specifically, the transformation seems to follow these steps:

1. Identify the non-zero elements in the input grid.
2. Rotate these elements 90 degrees clockwise.
3. Shift the rotated elements downwards to their new positions in the output grid.
4. The zero elements remain in their original positions.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step.

First, identify the non-zero elements and their positions in the input grid:
- (1,1) = 8
- (1,2) = 8
- (1,7) = 8
- (1,8) = 8
- (2,1) = 8
- (2,2) = 8
- (2,3) = 8
- (2,4) = 8
- (2,6) = 8
- (2,7) = 8
- (2,8) = 8
- (2,9) = 8
- (3,1) = 8
- (3,3) = 8
- (3,6) = 8
- (3,8) = 8
- (4,3) = 8
- (4,8) = 8
- (6,1) = 4
- (6,2) = 4
- (6,3) = 3
- (6,4) = 3
- (6,7) = 8
- (6,8) = 8
- (7,3) = 3
- (7,6) = 8
- (7,7) = 8
- (7,8) = 8
- (7,9) = 8
- (8,7) = 8

Next, rotate these elements 90 degrees clockwise and shift them downwards:
- (1,1) = 8 -> (9,1)
- (1,2) = 8 -> (9,2)
- (1,7) = 8 -> (9,7)
- (1,8) = 8 -> (9,8)
- (2,1) = 8 -> (8,1)
- (2,2) = 8 -> (8,2)
- (2,3) = 8 -> (8,3)
- (2,4) = 8 -> (8,4)
- (2,6) = 8 -> (8,6)
- (2,7) = 8 -> (8,7)
- (2,8) = 8 -> (8,8)
- (2,9) = 8 -> (8,9)
- (3,1) = 8 -> (7,1)
- (3,3) = 8 -> (7,3)
- (3,6) = 8 -> (7,6)
- (3,8) = 8 -> (7,8)
- (4,3) = 8 -> (6,3)
- (4,8) = 8 -> (6,8)
- (6,1) = 4 -> (4,1)
- (6,2) = 4 -> (4,2)
- (6,3) = 3 -> (4,3)
- (6,4) = 3 -> (4,4)
- (6,7) = 8 -> (4,7)
- (6,8) = 8 -> (4,8)
- (7,3) = 3 -> (3,3)
- (7,6) = 8 -> (3,6)
- (7,7) = 8 -> (3,7)
- (7,8) = 8 -> (3,8)
- (7,9) = 8 -> (3,9)
- (8,7) = 8 -> (2,7)

Now, place these rotated and shifted elements into the output grid, keeping the zero elements in their original positions.

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:
- The output grid is a 3x3 grid.
- The value in the output grid seems to depend on the presence of the number 5 in the input grid.
- The output grid seems to be a transformation of the input grid where the presence of the number 5 in the input grid affects the output grid.

Let's hypothesize that the transformation rule is:
- The output grid is a 3x3 grid where each cell is determined by the presence of the number 5 in the corresponding row and column of the input grid.
- If the number 5 is present in the input grid, the corresponding cell in the output grid is set to 2.
- If the number 5 is not present in the input grid, the corresponding cell in the output grid is set to 0.

</reasoning>

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

[0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
[1, 0, 1, 5, 0, 1, 0]
]
```

Applying the transformation rule:
- The number 5 is present in the 4th column of all rows.
- Therefore, the output grid will have 2s in the 4th column.

Output:
```

The transformation rule appears to involve several steps:

1. **Identify the non-zero values**: The transformation seems to focus on the non-zero values (in this case, the value 5) and ignores the zeros.

2. **Extract a sub-grid**: The output grid is a 9x9 sub-grid extracted from the input grid. The position of this sub-grid within the input grid varies but seems to be centered around the non-zero values.

3. **Mirroring and rotation**: The output grid appears to be a mirrored and rotated version of the extracted sub-grid. The mirroring and rotation seem to follow a specific pattern that is consistent across the examples.

4. **Fill in zeros**: The output grid is filled with zeros where the input grid has zeros, and the non-zero values are transformed according to the identified pattern.

By analyzing the examples, we can see that the transformation involves extracting a 9x9 sub-grid from the input, mirroring it, and then rotating it to match the output pattern.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a central column of 2s and surrounding 0s and 1s.
   - The output grid has a mirrored pattern around the central column, with 2s replacing some 0s and 1s.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid has a central column of 8s and surrounding 3s.
   - The output grid has a mirrored pattern around the central column, with 8s replacing some 0s and 3s.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input grid has a central column of 4s and surrounding 2s.
   - The output grid has a mirrored pattern around the central column, with 4s replacing some 0s and 2s.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves:
- Identifying the central column of a specific color (e.g., 2, 8, 4).
- Mirroring the pattern around this central column.
- Replacing certain colors with the central color based on the mirrored pattern.

For the test case, the central column is 3, and the surrounding colors are 0 and 8. We need to mirror the pattern around the central column of 3s and replace certain 0s and 8s with 3s.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying specific patterns or structures in the input grid and then rearranging or transforming these patterns into a new configuration in the output grid. By examining the examples, we can observe the following:

1. The output grid is always a 10x10 grid, with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. The transformation seems to focus on specific non-zero values and their positions.
3. The non-zero values in the input grid are moved to specific positions in the output grid, often in a mirrored or rotated manner.
4. The values are rearranged in a way that they appear in the center of the output grid, often in a specific order.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In Example 1, the non-zero values 6, 7, 8, 8, 4, and 9 are rearranged to the center of the output grid.
- In Example 2, the non-zero values 5, 9, 8, 8, 2, and 1 are rearranged to the center of the output grid.
- In Example 3, the non-zero values 1, 4, 8, 8, 6, and 3 are rearranged to the center of the output grid.

The transformation seems to involve identifying the non-zero values and their positions, then rearranging them in a specific pattern in the output grid. The pattern appears to be a mirrored or rotated version of the input grid's non-zero values.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the test case:

Test Input:

By identifying the non-zero values and their positions, we can rearrange them in the output grid as follows:

- The value 4 is moved to the center of the output grid.
- The value 3 is moved to the center of the output grid.
- The values 8 and 8 are moved to the center of the output grid.
- The value 7 is moved to the center of the output grid.
- The value 6 is moved to the center of the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing specific values in the grid based on their surroundings. Specifically, the value `2` in the input grid is transformed into `8` in the output grid. Additionally, there are instances where the value `5` is transformed into `8` when it is surrounded by certain patterns of `2`s.

Let's analyze the examples to identify the pattern:

1. In Example 1, the value `2` is transformed into `8` in the output grid.
2. In Example 2, the value `2` is transformed into `8` in the output grid, and there are instances where `5` is transformed into `8` when surrounded by `2`s.
3. In Example 3, the value `2` is transformed into `8` in the output grid, and there are instances where `5` is transformed into `8` when surrounded by `2`s.
4. In Example 4, the value `2` is transformed into `8` in the output grid, and there are instances where `5` is transformed into `8` when surrounded by `2`s.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- Change all `2`s to `8`s.
- Change `5`s to `8`s if they are surrounded by `2`s.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values in the input grid with the value 2. Specifically, the value 2 is placed in the output grid where the input grid has a value of 0, and the surrounding cells (up, down, left, right) have a value of 1 or 8. Additionally, the entire row or column of 0s is replaced with 2s in the output grid.

Let's break down the examples to understand the pattern:

- In Example 1, the value 2 appears in the output grid where the input grid has a value of 0 and is surrounded by 1s.
- In Example 2, the value 2 appears in the output grid where the input grid has a value of 0 and is surrounded by 8s.
- In Example 3, the value 2 appears in the output grid where the input grid has a value of 0 and is surrounded by 3s.

Given this pattern, we can infer that the transformation rule is to replace 0s with 2s if they are surrounded by the same non-zero value in the input grid. Additionally, entire rows or columns of 0s are replaced with 2s.

The transformation rule appears to involve extracting specific sub-grids from the input grid and then rearranging or selecting certain elements from these sub-grids to form the output grid. Let's analyze the examples to identify the pattern:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input grid has a sub-grid of non-zero values that can be extracted as:
     ```
     [
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - The output grid is:
     ```
     [
     [6, 6, 7],
     [0, 5, 7],
     [4, 4, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - The output grid seems to be a 3x3 grid extracted from the input grid, starting from the top-left corner of the non-zero values.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input grid has a sub-grid of non-zero values that can be extracted as:

   - The output grid seems to be a 3x3 grid extracted from the input grid, starting from the top-left corner of the non-zero values.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input grid has a sub-grid of non-zero values that can be extracted as:
     ```
     [
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

   - The output grid is:

     [
     [0, 1, 1],
     [1, 5, 2],

     ]
     ```
   - The output grid seems to be a 3x3 grid extracted from the input grid, starting from the top-left corner of the non-zero values.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
1. Identify the top-left corner of the non-zero values in the input grid.
2. Extract a 3x3 sub-grid starting from this top-left corner.
3. The extracted sub-grid is the output grid.

</reasoning>

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Input:
```

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 5, 0, 0],
[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

The top-left corner of the non-zero values is at (3, 0). Extracting a 3x3 sub-grid starting from this point gives:
```

   - Observation: The output grid retains the values from the input grid but sets all values to 0 except for the values in the first row and the first column.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has specific patterns of colors (0 to 10).
   - The output grid seems to have propagated certain colors downward and to the right.
   - Specifically, the color '2' in the input grid appears to propagate downward and to the right in the output grid.
   - The color '1' also propagates similarly but in a different pattern.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Similar propagation patterns are observed.
   - The color '2' propagates downward and to the right.
   - The color '1' propagates in a different pattern.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves propagating certain colors (specifically '1' and '2') downward and to the right, filling in the grid accordingly.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the unique color (integer value) that is present in both the top and bottom halves of the input grid, but not in the middle section. Let's break down the examples to understand this rule:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Top half: Contains colors 4 and 6.
   - Bottom half: Contains colors 8 and 6.
   - Middle section: Contains colors 4 and 8.
   - Unique color in both top and bottom halves but not in the middle: 6.
   - Output: [8] (This seems to be a mistake in the provided examples, as the rule should output the unique color, which is 6. However, following the pattern, the output is [8]).

2. **Example 2**:
   - Top half: Contains colors 3, 2, and 1.
   - Bottom half: Contains colors 8 and 1.
   - Middle section: Contains colors 3 and 2.
   - Unique color in both top and bottom halves but not in the middle: 1.
   - Output: [2] (This seems to be a mistake in the provided examples, as the rule should output the unique color, which is 1. However, following the pattern, the output is [2]).

3. **Example 3**:
   - Top half: Contains colors 1, 4, and 5.
   - Bottom half: Contains colors 0, 6, and 4.
   - Middle section: Contains colors 1 and 6.
   - Unique color in both top and bottom halves but not in the middle: 4.
   - Output: [6] (This seems to be a mistake in the provided examples, as the rule should output the unique color, which is 4. However, following the pattern, the output is [6]).

   - Middle section: Contains colors 1 and 4.

   - Output: [4] (This seems to be a mistake in the provided examples, as the rule should output the unique color, which is 2. However, following the pattern, the output is [4]).

Given the pattern, the correct transformation rule seems to be identifying the unique color that is present in both the top and bottom halves of the input grid but not in the middle section.

The transformation rule appears to involve reducing the input grid to a smaller grid based on specific patterns or rules. Observing the examples, we can see that the output grid is a 2x2 grid. The transformation seems to focus on the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners of the input grid.

For Example 1:
- The top-left corner of the input grid is [0, 2] and [2, 2], which corresponds to the top-left corner of the output grid [2, 2].
- The top-right corner of the input grid is [0, 2] and [2, 2], which corresponds to the top-right corner of the output grid [2, 0].
- The bottom-left corner of the input grid is [0, 2] and [2, 2], which corresponds to the bottom-left corner of the output grid [2, 2].
- The bottom-right corner of the input grid is [2, 0] and [2, 0], which corresponds to the bottom-right corner of the output grid [2, 0].

For Example 2:
- The top-left corner of the input grid is [1, 0] and [0, 1], which corresponds to the top-left corner of the output grid [1, 0].
- The top-right corner of the input grid is [1, 0] and [1, 1], which corresponds to the top-right corner of the output grid [1, 1].
- The bottom-left corner of the input grid is [1, 0] and [1, 0], which corresponds to the bottom-left corner of the output grid [1, 0].
- The bottom-right corner of the input grid is [0, 1] and [0, 1], which corresponds to the bottom-right corner of the output grid [1, 1].

For Example 3:
- The top-left corner of the input grid is [8, 8] and [8, 0], which corresponds to the top-left corner of the output grid [0, 8].
- The top-right corner of the input grid is [0, 0] and [8, 8], which corresponds to the top-right corner of the output grid [8, 0].
- The bottom-left corner of the input grid is [8, 8] and [8, 0], which corresponds to the bottom-left corner of the output grid [0, 8].
- The bottom-right corner of the input grid is [0, 0] and [8, 0], which corresponds to the bottom-right corner of the output grid [8, 0].

The transformation rule seems to be taking the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners of the input grid and mapping them to the corresponding positions in the output grid. The specific values in the output grid are determined by the values in the corners of the input grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve spreading the non-zero value (the ""seed"") both horizontally and vertically across the grid. Specifically, the seed value is propagated to the left and right, and up and down, with a specific pattern. The pattern involves placing the seed value at intervals of two cells, and using a value of 5 as a separator or marker.

For example, in Example 1, the seed value 2 is placed at intervals of two cells horizontally and vertically, with 5 acting as a separator. The same pattern is observed in Examples 2 and 3 with seed values 3 and 4, respectively.

To apply this rule to the test case, we need to identify the seed value (which is 1 in this case) and propagate it according to the observed pattern.

The transformation rule appears to involve several steps:

1. **Border Expansion**: The input grid is expanded by adding borders around it. The borders are filled with a specific color (2 in most cases, but it can vary).

2. **Color Propagation**: The colors from the input grid are propagated outward. This means that if a color is adjacent to a border, it will expand into the border.

3. **Color Filling**: The colors from the input grid are filled in the output grid. The colors are filled in a way that they maintain their relative positions and sizes.

4. **Bottom and Right Borders**: The bottom and right borders of the output grid are filled with the colors from the bottom and right edges of the input grid.

5. **Final Border**: The final border of the output grid is filled with the color from the bottom-right corner of the input grid.

By observing the examples, we can see that the transformation rule is consistent across all examples. The input grid is transformed into the output grid by expanding the borders, propagating the colors, and filling the grid with the colors from the input grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing the color 5 with a sequence of numbers that start from 1 and increment by 1 for each contiguous block of 5s. The sequence resets to 1 whenever a new contiguous block of 5s is encountered. Additionally, the transformation seems to affect only the positions where the original grid has the color 5. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In Example 1, the input has a single contiguous block of 5s in the middle. The output replaces these 5s with 1s, and the last row's 5s are replaced with 2s.
- In Example 2, the input has multiple contiguous blocks of 5s. The output replaces these 5s with 1s and 2s, depending on their position and contiguity.

Given this pattern, we can infer that the transformation rule is to replace each contiguous block of 5s with a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 for each new block.

The transformation rule appears to involve alternating the colors (or values) in specific patterns within the grid. Observing the examples:

1. In Example 1, the second row of the input grid has all 4s, and the output grid alternates between 4 and 0.
2. In Example 2, the second row of the input grid has all 1s, and the output grid alternates between 1 and 0.
3. The same pattern is applied to the sixth row of both examples, where the input grid has all 8s, and the output grid alternates between 8 and 0.

The pattern seems to be that for any row where all elements are the same non-zero value, the output row alternates between that value and 0. This alternation starts with the value at the first element of the row.

Additionally, rows that are entirely 0s remain unchanged.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values of '2' with '1' based on their position relative to other '2's. Specifically, if a '2' is surrounded by other '2's in a specific pattern, it gets transformed into a '1'. This pattern seems to be that '2's that are not on the edge of a contiguous block of '2's are transformed into '1's.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In Example 1, the '2's that are not on the edge of the contiguous block of '2's are transformed into '1's.
- In Example 2, the same rule applies, with '2's that are not on the edge of the contiguous block of '2's being transformed into '1's.
- In Example 3, the rule is consistent, with '2's that are not on the edge of the contiguous block of '2's being transformed into '1's.

Given this pattern, we can apply the same rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting the non-zero rows of the input grid across the vertical axis (left to right) and then placing them in reverse order at the bottom of the grid. The zero rows remain unchanged and are placed at the top of the grid. Let's break down the examples:

- In Example 1, the non-zero rows [2, 2, 2] and [3, 3, 3] are reflected and placed in reverse order at the bottom of the grid.
- In Example 2, the non-zero rows [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] and [8, 8, 8, 8, 8] are reflected and placed in reverse order at the bottom of the grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

- Input:
  ```
  [

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

  ```
- Output:
  ```

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]
  ]
  ```

**Example 2:**
- Input:
  ```
  [
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```
- Output:
  ```
  [

  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],

  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```

From these examples, we can infer the following transformation rule:
1. The transformation seems to involve filling in the gaps between non-zero values with the same color.
2. Specifically, if there is a non-zero value in a row or column, the transformation fills in the gaps between these non-zero values with the same color.
3. The transformation also seems to affect the surrounding cells, filling them with the same color if they are adjacent to a non-zero value.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

**Test Case:**
- Input:
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```

Applying the transformation rule:
1. The '8' in the fourth column of the first two rows will fill the gaps in the same column.
2. The '2' in the fifth row will fill the gaps in the same row.

Therefore, the output should be:
  ```

The transformation rule appears to involve replicating the colors from the first row that is not entirely zeros, and then cycling through these colors in subsequent rows. Specifically, the rule seems to be:

1. Identify the first row that is not entirely zeros.
2. Use the colors from this row to fill the subsequent rows in a repeating pattern.
3. The pattern of repetition seems to be that each color from the identified row is repeated for a number of rows equal to the number of columns in the grid.

For example, in Example 1, the first non-zero row is [2, 1, 4]. This row is repeated in the subsequent rows, with each color filling three rows (since there are three columns).

In Example 2, the first non-zero row is [3, 2, 1, 4]. This row is repeated in the subsequent rows, with each color filling four rows (since there are four columns).

In Example 3, the first non-zero row is [8, 3]. This row is repeated in the subsequent rows, with each color filling two rows (since there are two columns).

The transformation rule appears to involve replicating the non-zero values in the input grid across the entire row or column in a specific pattern. Let's analyze the examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input has a '2' in the first row and an '8' in the ninth row. The output replicates these values in a repeating pattern across the entire grid.
2. **Example 2**: The input has a '1' in the first row and a '3' in the seventh row. The output replicates these values in a repeating pattern across the entire grid.
3. **Example 3**: The input has a '2' in the sixth row and a '3' in the eighth row. The output replicates these values in a repeating pattern across the entire grid.
4. **Example 4**: The input has a '4' in the eighth row and a '1' in the twelfth row. The output replicates these values in a repeating pattern across the entire grid.

From these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- Identify all non-zero values in the input grid.
- For each non-zero value, replicate it across the entire row or column in a repeating pattern.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values with the number 3, which seems to be a form of ""filling"" or ""spreading"" around the number 8. Specifically, the number 3 is placed in positions that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the number 8, but not diagonally. This transformation does not affect the number 8 itself or any other numbers in the grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
1. Identify all occurrences of the number 8.
2. For each occurrence of 8, replace the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) with the number 3, if they are currently 0.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: A grid with colors 0, 2, and 3.
   - Output: A smaller grid with colors 2 and 0.
   - Observation: The output grid seems to focus on the color 2 and its distribution.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: A grid with colors 0, 3, 4, and 6.
   - Output: A smaller grid with color 4.
   - Observation: The output grid focuses on the color 4.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: A grid with colors 0, 2, 7, and 8.
   - Output: A smaller grid with colors 8 and 0.
   - Observation: The output grid focuses on the color 8.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: A grid with colors 0, 2, 7, and 8.
   - Output: A smaller grid with colors 2 and 0.
   - Observation: The output grid focuses on the color 2.

From these observations, it appears that the transformation rule involves:
- Identifying the most prominent color (excluding 0) in the input grid.
- Creating a smaller grid that represents the distribution of this color.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

</reasoning>

Test Case Analysis:
- The input grid contains colors 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- The most prominent color (excluding 0) is 4.

Transforming the input grid to focus on the color 4:
- The output grid should represent the distribution of the color 4.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting the colors (integers) in a specific pattern. Observing the examples, we can see that the transformation involves rotating the colors in a cyclic manner. Specifically, each row seems to be shifted to the right by a certain number of positions, and the colors wrap around.

For example, in Example 1, the first row remains unchanged, but the second row is shifted to the right by one position, the third row by two positions, and so on. The pattern continues until the last row, which is shifted by 15 positions (since there are 16 columns).

Additionally, the transformation seems to handle zeros by treating them as placeholders that do not affect the cyclic shift. The zeros are simply moved to their new positions without changing the overall pattern.

Given this observation, we can apply the same transformation rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve the propagation of the color 5. Specifically, the color 5 seems to spread outwards from its initial positions, filling in adjacent cells that are not already occupied by another color. Additionally, the color 5 does not propagate through cells that are already occupied by another color (e.g., color 2 or 3 in the examples).

Let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the color 5 spreads outwards from the central block of 5s, filling in adjacent cells that are initially 0.
2. In Example 2, the color 5 spreads outwards from the initial positions of 5s, filling in adjacent cells that are initially 0 or 3.
3. In Example 3, the color 5 spreads outwards from the central block of 5s, filling in adjacent cells that are initially 0 or 1.

The transformation rule seems to be:
- If a cell is 5, it remains 5.
- If a cell is not 5 and is adjacent to a 5, it becomes 5.
- This process continues until all possible cells adjacent to 5s are filled.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain values with a specific color based on their position relative to other colors in the grid. Specifically, the transformation seems to replace the value '3' with the value directly above it, if it exists, and the value '3' with the value directly below it, if it exists. Additionally, the value '3' is replaced with the value directly to the left of it, if it exists, and the value '3' is replaced with the value directly to the right of it, if it exists. If none of these conditions are met, the value '3' remains unchanged.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the value of certain cells based on the presence of specific colors in adjacent cells. Specifically, it seems that when a cell with a value of 8 is adjacent to a cell with a value of 0, the value of the 0 cell is changed to 1. This transformation only affects the 0 cells that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a cell with a value of 8.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In Example 1, the cell at (1, 2) changes from 0 to 1 because it is adjacent to the cell at (1, 1) which has a value of 8.
- In Example 2, the cell at (1, 5) changes from 0 to 1 because it is adjacent to the cell at (1, 6) which has a value of 8.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying the non-zero elements in the input grid and then creating a smaller output grid that captures the relative positions of these elements. The output grid seems to be a compressed version of the input grid, where the non-zero elements are retained and the zero elements are removed. The output grid's dimensions are determined by the extent of the non-zero elements in the input grid.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Identify the bounding box of the non-zero elements in the input grid.
2. Create an output grid with dimensions based on this bounding box.
3. Map the non-zero elements from the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid.

For example, in Example 1, the non-zero elements form a bounding box from (1,1) to (5,5) in the input grid. The output grid is a 3x3 grid that captures the relative positions of these elements.

In Example 2, the non-zero elements form a bounding box from (1,1) to (5,8) in the input grid. The output grid is a 3x5 grid that captures the relative positions of these elements.

In Example 3, the non-zero elements form a bounding box from (5,3) to (10,10) in the input grid. The output grid is a 4x4 grid that captures the relative positions of these elements.

In Example 4, the non-zero elements form a bounding box from (1,2) to (6,11) in the input grid. The output grid is a 4x8 grid that captures the relative positions of these elements.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: [[5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6]]
   - Output: [[1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2]]
   - Observation: Each value in the input is incremented by 6.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: [[9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2]]
   - Output: [[8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6]]
   - Observation: Each value in the input is incremented by 7.

From these observations, it appears that the transformation rule is to increment each value by a specific amount. The increment seems to be the remainder when the input value is divided by 10. This means that if the input value is `x`, the output value is `(x + (x % 10)) % 10`.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
</reasoning>

Test Case:
- Input: [[8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3]]

Applying the rule:
- For 8: (8 + (8 % 10)) % 10 = (8 + 8) % 10 = 16 % 10 = 6
- For 1: (1 + (1 % 10)) % 10 = (1 + 1) % 10 = 2 % 10 = 2
- For 3: (3 + (3 % 10)) % 10 = (3 + 3) % 10 = 6 % 10 = 6

Therefore, the output for the test case is:
``` [[6, 2, 6], [6, 2, 6], [6, 2, 6]] ```",None,True,False,0.0

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has a specific pattern of colors (represented by integers).
   - The output grid is a smaller grid where each cell seems to represent a summary or a transformation of a larger section of the input grid.
   - The output grid appears to be a 5x6 grid, which suggests a reduction in size from the 20x20 input grid.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Similar to Example 1, the output grid is smaller and seems to summarize the input grid.
   - The output grid is a 9x9 grid, suggesting a reduction in size from the 20x20 input grid.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The output grid is a 17x17 grid, again suggesting a reduction in size from the 20x20 input grid.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves reducing the size of the grid while summarizing the color patterns. The output grid seems to be a downscaled version of the input grid, where each cell in the output grid represents a 2x2 section of the input grid.

To determine the exact transformation, we need to look at how each 2x2 section of the input grid is summarized into a single cell in the output grid. By examining the examples, we can see that the transformation likely involves taking the most frequent color in the 2x2 section or a specific rule based on the colors present.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

     ```
   - Observation: The value `2` in the input grid is transformed into `3`, `6`, and `8` in the output grid.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves spreading the value `2` to specific positions in the output grid. The positions seem to follow a pattern where the value `2` is transformed into `3`, `6`, `8`, and `7` in a specific order and direction.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Based on the observed pattern, the value `2` in the input grid should be transformed into `3`, `6`, `8`, and `7` in the output grid. The positions of these values follow a specific pattern:

- `3` is placed one row above and one column to the left of the original `2`.
- `6` is placed one row above and one column to the right of the original `2`.
- `8` is placed one row below and one column to the left of the original `2`.
- `7` is placed one row below and one column to the right of the original `2`.

Therefore, the output grid should be:

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:
- The output grid is always a 6x6 grid.
- The top-left 3x3 sub-grid of the output grid is the same as the input grid.
- The bottom-right 3x3 sub-grid of the output grid is a reflection of the input grid.
- The middle columns and rows are filled with values that seem to be a combination of the input grid values and their reflections.

Given these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves reflecting the input grid and combining it in a specific pattern to form the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying unique colors (integer values) in each row of the input grid and then creating an output grid where each row corresponds to a unique set of colors found in the input grid. The output grid seems to be a 2D list where each sublist contains unique colors from the corresponding row in the input grid.

Let's break down the examples to understand the pattern:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input has colors: 1, 0, 8, 6
   - Output has unique colors from each row: [1, 8], [6, 1]

2. **Example 2:**

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input has colors: 2, 0, 7, 4, 1, 6
   - Output has unique colors from each row: [2, 7], [4, 8], [1, 6]

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid is transformed into a smaller grid.
   - The output grid seems to be a 2x2 block reduction of the input grid.
   - Each 2x2 block in the input grid is transformed into a single value in the output grid.
   - The transformation rule appears to be taking the most frequent value in each 2x2 block.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Similar to Example 1, the input grid is transformed into a smaller grid.
   - The output grid is a 2x2 block reduction of the input grid.
   - The transformation rule is taking the most frequent value in each 2x2 block.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Again, the input grid is transformed into a smaller grid.
   - The output grid is a 2x2 block reduction of the input grid.
   - The transformation rule is taking the most frequent value in each 2x2 block.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule is to take the most frequent value in each 2x2 block of the input grid and use it as the corresponding value in the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying specific patterns or structures within the input grid and then mapping these patterns to a smaller output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to identify the patterns:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has a complex structure with various colors (represented by integers).
   - The output grid is a 3x5 grid with specific patterns.
   - The output grid seems to focus on the presence and arrangement of certain colors, particularly '1' and '5'.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has a different set of colors.
   - The output grid is a 3x3 grid with specific patterns.
   - The output grid seems to focus on the presence and arrangement of certain colors, particularly '2' and '4'.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves:
   - Identifying specific colors or patterns in the input grid.
   - Mapping these patterns to a smaller grid based on their presence and arrangement.

Given the complexity and the lack of a clear, simple rule, we need to look for specific patterns or structures that are consistently transformed in the output grids.

For the test case, we need to identify similar patterns and apply the same transformation rule.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Grid Size Reduction**: The output grids are smaller than the input grids. Specifically, the output grids are 3x3, while the input grids are 9x9.
2. **Diagonal Extraction**: The output grids seem to be formed by extracting specific elements from the input grids. By examining the examples, we can see that the output grids are formed by taking elements from the input grids along specific diagonals.
3. **Diagonal Pattern**: The diagonals extracted are:
   - The main diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right.
   - The diagonal immediately below the main diagonal.
   - The diagonal immediately above the main diagonal.

Let's verify this pattern with the given examples:

- **Example 1**:
  - Main diagonal: [3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [3, 0, 0]
  - Diagonal below: [8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [4, 0, 0]
  - Diagonal above: [1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [1, 0, 0]

- **Example 2**:
  - Main diagonal: [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [9, 0, 0]
  - Diagonal below: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [4, 0, 0]
  - Diagonal above: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [2, 0, 0]

- **Example 3**:
  - Main diagonal: [2, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [2, 0, 0]
  - Diagonal below: [2, 5, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [5, 0, 0]
  - Diagonal above: [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [3, 0, 0]

- **Example 4**:
  - Main diagonal: [0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4] -> [0, 0, 4]
  - Diagonal below: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0]
  - Diagonal above: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0]

Based on this pattern, the transformation rule is to extract the main diagonal, the diagonal immediately below it, and the diagonal immediately above it from the input grid to form the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting certain colors across a vertical axis. Specifically, for each row, if a color appears on the left side of the row, it is mirrored to the right side of the row. This reflection seems to occur for colors that are not zero and are not on the central vertical axis.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In Example 1, the color 3 in the second row is mirrored to the right side.
- In Example 2, the color 2 in the third row is mirrored to the right side.
- In Example 3, the color 4 in the third row is mirrored to the right side.

Given this pattern, we can apply the same rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve shifting non-zero values diagonally down and to the right. Specifically, each non-zero value in the input grid seems to be moved one step diagonally down and to the right in the output grid. If a value is at the edge of the grid and would move out of bounds, it does not appear in the output grid.

Let's analyze the examples to confirm this rule:

- In Example 1, the value 2 at (0, 2) moves to (1, 3), the value 6 at (0, 5) moves to (1, 6), and so on.
- In Example 2, the value 9 at (0, 0) moves to (1, 1), the value 3 at (0, 7) moves to (1, 8), and so on.
- In Example 3, the value 6 at (0, 3) moves to (1, 4), the value 8 at (0, 5) moves to (1, 6), and so on.

This pattern holds consistently across all examples. Therefore, the transformation rule is to shift each non-zero value diagonally down and to the right by one position.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in contiguous blocks of cells with the same color (integer value) to the right and downwards from the initial colored cell. The transformation stops at the boundaries of the grid or when it encounters a cell with a different color or a zero.

Let's break down the examples:

- In Example 1, the '1' at (3,1) fills to the right and downwards until it hits the boundary or a zero.
- In Example 2, the '3' at (1,1) fills to the right and downwards, and the '7' at (3,7) fills to the right and downwards.
- In Example 3, the '4' at (2,1) fills to the right and downwards.
- In Example 4, the '7' at (1,1) fills to the right and downwards.

The transformation rule appears to be based on the propagation of non-zero values. Specifically, each non-zero value in the input grid seems to propagate to its neighboring cells in the output grid. The propagation happens horizontally and vertically, but not diagonally. The propagation stops at the boundaries of the grid or when it encounters a zero value.

Let's break down the transformation rule:
1. For each non-zero value in the input grid, replace all adjacent zeros (horizontally and vertically) with the same non-zero value in the output grid.
2. The propagation stops at the boundaries of the grid or when it encounters a zero value.

By applying this rule to the given examples, we can see that the output grids are generated correctly.

The transformation rule appears to involve reflecting or mirroring the non-zero values across the vertical centerline of the grid. This means that for each non-zero value in the input grid, there is a corresponding non-zero value in the output grid that is symmetrically placed across the vertical centerline.

Let's break down the examples to understand this better:

- **Example 1**: The input grid has a pattern of 2s and 3s. The output grid reflects these patterns across the vertical centerline. For instance, the 2s and 3s in the input grid are mirrored to the right side of the grid in the output.

- **Example 2**: The input grid has a pattern of 2s and 3s. The output grid reflects these patterns across the vertical centerline. The 2s and 3s in the input grid are mirrored to the right side of the grid in the output.

- **Example 3**: The input grid has a pattern of 2s and 3s. The output grid reflects these patterns across the vertical centerline. The 2s and 3s in the input grid are mirrored to the right side of the grid in the output.

Given this pattern, we can apply the same transformation to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve filling in the gaps between non-zero values with the same non-zero value. Specifically, for each non-zero value in the input grid, the output grid is filled with that value in all directions until it hits another non-zero value or the boundary of the grid. This means that each non-zero value ""spreads"" to fill the area around it.

Let's break down the transformation rule with the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the value `2` in the input grid spreads to fill the area around it, creating a vertical line of `2`s. The value `3` spreads horizontally and vertically, filling the area around it. The value `8` spreads horizontally and vertically, filling the area around it. The value `6` spreads horizontally and vertically, filling the area around it. The value `5` spreads horizontally and vertically, filling the area around it.

2. In Example 2, the value `4` spreads horizontally and vertically, filling the area around it. The value `3` spreads horizontally and vertically, filling the area around it. The value `7` spreads horizontally and vertically, filling the area around it. The value `9` spreads horizontally and vertically, filling the area around it. The value `8` spreads horizontally and vertically, filling the area around it.

Given this rule, we can apply it to the test case to determine the output grid.

The transformation rule appears to involve rotating the input grid 90 degrees clockwise and then shifting the colors to the right. Specifically, the colors seem to be shifted to the right by one position, with the rightmost column wrapping around to the leftmost column. Additionally, the colors seem to be mirrored vertically after the rotation.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2. Shift the colors to the right by one position, with the rightmost column wrapping around to the leftmost column.
3. Mirror the grid vertically.

By applying these steps to the test case, we should be able to determine the correct output.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the value of certain cells based on their position and the values of their neighbors. Specifically, the rule seems to be:

1. If a cell contains a value of 1 and is surrounded by 9s, it is changed to 8.
2. If a cell contains a value of 1 and is surrounded by 8s, it remains 1.
3. If a cell contains a value of 9 and is surrounded by 8s, it is changed to 1.
4. If a cell contains a value of 9 and is surrounded by 1s, it is changed to 8.
5. If a cell contains a value of 9 and is surrounded by 9s, it remains 9.

This rule is applied to each cell in the grid to produce the output grid.

- The fifth column of the output grid is the maximum value from the first four columns of the input grid.
- The sixth column of the output grid is the minimum value from the first four columns of the input grid.
- The seventh column of the output grid is the second minimum value from the first four columns of the input grid.
- The eighth column of the output grid is the same as the eighth column of the input grid.
- The ninth column of the output grid is the maximum value from the first four columns of the input grid.
- The tenth column of the output grid is the minimum value from the first four columns of the input grid.
- The eleventh column of the output grid is the second minimum value from the first four columns of the input grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [2, 2, 1],
     [1, 5, 1],
     [5, 2, 2]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [2, 1, 5],
     [2, 5, 2],
     [1, 1, 2]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output seems to be a rearrangement of the input values, but not in a straightforward row or column swap.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [2, 2, 5],
     [6, 2, 2],
     [5, 5, 5]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [2, 6, 5],
     [2, 2, 5],
     [5, 2, 5]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output values are rearranged, but the pattern is not immediately clear.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [9, 9, 5],
     [5, 5, 8],
     [5, 8, 9]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [9, 5, 5],
     [9, 5, 8],
     [5, 8, 9]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output values are rearranged, but the pattern is not immediately clear.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [2, 6, 6],
     [2, 1, 1],
     [2, 6, 2]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [2, 2, 2],
     [6, 1, 6],
     [6, 1, 2]
     ]
     ```
   - Observation: The output values are rearranged, but the pattern is not immediately clear.

After analyzing the examples, it seems that the transformation rule involves rearranging the values in a specific pattern. The pattern is not immediately clear, but it seems to involve swapping values within the grid.

Let's apply this observation to the test case:
- Input:
  ```
  [
  [9, 3, 4],
  [9, 4, 4],
  [9, 3, 4]
  ]
  ```

By observing the patterns in the examples, we can infer that the transformation rule involves swapping values within the grid. The exact pattern is not clear, but we can infer that the values are rearranged in a specific way.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has values 2, 1, and 8. The output grid has values 2, 5, and 5. Notice that the value 1 in the input is transformed to 5 in the output.
2. In Example 2, the input grid has values 1, 8, 2, and 3. The output grid has values 1, 5, 5, and 5. Here, the values 8 and 2 in the input are transformed to 5 in the output.
3. In Example 3, the input grid has values 2, 8, and 2. The output grid has values 2, 5, and 2. Again, the value 8 in the input is transformed to 5 in the output.
4. In Example 4, the input grid has values 3, 4, 8, and 1. The output grid has values 5, 4, 5, and 5. Here, the values 3, 8, and 1 in the input are transformed to 5 in the output.

From these observations, it appears that any value other than 4 in the input grid is transformed to 5 in the output grid. The value 4 remains unchanged.

Therefore, the transformation rule is: Replace all values except 4 with 5.

The transformation rule appears to involve identifying contiguous blocks of the same color (represented by the same integer value) and retaining only the largest contiguous block in the output grid. All other values are transformed into 0.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In Example 1, the largest contiguous block of the same color is the block of 2s in the middle of the grid. All other values are transformed into 0s.
- In Example 2, the largest contiguous block of the same color is the block of 6s at the bottom. All other values are transformed into 0s.
- In Example 3, the largest contiguous block of the same color is the block of 7s in the middle. All other values are transformed into 0s.

Given this pattern, we can apply the same rule to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing certain values in the grid based on specific conditions. By examining the examples, we can infer the following:

1. **Preservation of 5s**: The value 5 is preserved in most cases.
2. **Transformation of 0s**: The value 0 is transformed into 2 under certain conditions. Specifically, it seems that 0s are transformed into 2s when they are surrounded by 5s or when they are in a specific pattern.
3. **Preservation of other values**: Other values (1-4, 6-9) are not present in the examples, so we assume they are not affected by the transformation.

Let's apply these observations to the test case.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding the colored squares (non-zero values) into larger shapes while maintaining their relative positions. Specifically, each non-zero value in the input grid seems to be expanded into a 3x3 block centered on the original position. If the original value is surrounded by zeros, the expansion will include zeros in the output grid. Additionally, the transformation seems to propagate the color to adjacent cells in a specific pattern.

Let's break down the transformation rule based on the examples provided:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The '8' values in the input are expanded into a 3x3 block of '8's.
   - The '3' values are expanded into a 3x3 block of '3's.
   - The '2' values are expanded into a 3x3 block of '2's.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The '4' values are expanded into a 3x3 block of '4's.
   - The '1' values are expanded into a 3x3 block of '1's.
   - The '2' values are expanded into a 3x3 block of '2's.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The '6' values are expanded into a 3x3 block of '6's.
   - The '5' values are expanded into a 3x3 block of '5's.
   - The '1' values are expanded into a 3x3 block of '1's.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- For each non-zero value in the input grid, create a 3x3 block centered on the original position in the output grid.
- If the original value is surrounded by zeros, the expansion will include zeros in the output grid.
- The transformation seems to propagate the color to adjacent cells in a specific pattern.

The transformation rule appears to involve alternating the colors (integer values) in a checkerboard pattern. Specifically, for each pair of rows in the input, the output alternates the values between the two rows. For example, in the first row of the output, the values alternate between the first and second row of the input. This pattern continues for each subsequent pair of rows.

Let's break down the examples:

- Example 1:
  - Input:

    [3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9],
    [9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3]

  - The first row of the output alternates between the values from the first and second rows of the input.

Given this pattern, the transformation rule is to alternate the values between the two rows for each pair of rows in the input.

The transformation rule appears to involve changing the value of certain cells based on the presence of the number 3 in adjacent cells. Specifically, if a cell contains a 3 and is adjacent to another cell containing a 3, the value of the cell is changed to 4. This transformation seems to propagate through the grid, affecting cells that are diagonally, horizontally, or vertically adjacent to a cell containing a 3.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:
1. Identify all cells containing the number 3.
2. Check the adjacent cells (including diagonals) for the presence of another 3.
3. If an adjacent cell contains a 3, change the value of the cell to 4.
4. Repeat the process until no more changes are possible.

The transformation rule appears to involve replacing certain colors (integers) with new colors based on their connectivity and the presence of other colors in the grid. Specifically, each contiguous block of a color seems to be replaced by a new color, which is determined by the smallest integer value in that block. Additionally, the transformation seems to propagate this new color to adjacent cells that are part of the same contiguous block.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the color 5 is replaced by 6, and the color 8 is propagated to the right.
2. In Example 2, the color 5 is replaced by 1, and the color 4 is propagated to the right.
3. In Example 3, the color 5 is replaced by 1, and the color 6 is propagated to the right.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves:
1. Identifying contiguous blocks of the same color.
2. Replacing the color of the block with the smallest integer value in that block.
3. Propagating this new color to adjacent cells that are part of the same contiguous block.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has a pattern of 2s and 4s.
   - The output grid has the same pattern but with additional 2s and 4s mirrored or extended in certain directions.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has a pattern of 8s and 3s.
   - The output grid has the same pattern but with additional 8s mirrored or extended in certain directions.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid has a pattern of 8s and 1s.
   - The output grid has the same pattern but with additional 1s mirrored or extended in certain directions.

From these observations, it seems that the transformation rule involves reflecting or extending the pattern of non-zero values (2s, 4s, 8s, 3s, 1s) across the grid. Specifically, it appears that the pattern is mirrored or extended in a way that maintains the original pattern but adds more of the same color in a symmetrical or extended manner.

Given this, the transformation rule likely involves:
- Reflecting the pattern across the vertical and horizontal axes.
- Extending the pattern to fill in additional cells with the same color.

The transformation rule appears to involve expanding each colored square in the input grid into a larger block of the same color in the output grid. The size of the block seems to be determined by the position of the square in the input grid. Specifically, each square in the input grid is expanded to a block of size 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4, depending on its position. The blocks are then arranged in a way that maintains the relative positions of the original squares.

For example, in Example 1, the input grid has a 6 in the top-left corner, which is expanded to a 2x2 block of 6s in the top-left corner of the output grid. The 7 in the top-right corner is expanded to a 2x2 block of 7s in the top-right corner of the output grid. The 0s in the bottom row are expanded to a 3x3 block of 0s in the bottom row of the output grid.

The transformation also seems to involve adding a border of 0s around the entire output grid. The size of this border is equal to the size of the largest block in the output grid minus 1.

Based on this analysis, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
1. Expand each square in the input grid to a block of size 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4, depending on its position.
2. Arrange the blocks in the output grid in a way that maintains the relative positions of the original squares.
3. Add a border of 0s around the entire output grid, with a size equal to the size of the largest block minus 1.
