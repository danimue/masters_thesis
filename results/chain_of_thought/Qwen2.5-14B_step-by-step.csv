75b8110e,"To find the rule that transforms the input grids into the respective output grids, let's analyze the examples provided:

Firstly, observe that in each output grid, the dimensions are reduced compared to the input grid. Each output cell seems to summarize information from a larger area in the input grid.

Let's break down the transformation process based on the given examples:

1. We see that the input grid is 8x8 and the output is 4x4.
2. It appears that each output cell value corresponds to a specific pattern or the dominant color in a 2x2 block from the input grid.
3. For every 2x2 block in the input grid, the output cell seems to be the result of a certain operation, which could be related to the sum, average, or even just the presence of specific numbers.

The output cells seem to capture patterns that are not directly the sum or average but a representative number based on the distribution of non-zero values within the 2x2 blocks. Looking closely at the transition for each example:

- In Example 1, if we look at the first 2x2 block of the input grid [[4,4],[4,4]], the corresponding output cell is [4,4], indicating that the pattern is preserved as is.
- Example 2 and beyond show more complex interactions, often taking the non-zero values from the bottom-right corner of each 2x2 block to fill in the output cell.

Based on these observations, the rule can be described as follows:
- Take the bottom-right value of each 2x2 block in the input grid.
- If the bottom-right value is zero, take the next non-zero value in the clockwise direction starting from the top-left corner.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[0, 4, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5],
[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[6, 0, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0],
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9],
[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
]
```

We'll extract the bottom-right value for each 2x2 block and apply the fallback mechanism if necessary.

1. First block: [0, 4] -> [4, 4] => Bottom-right is 4
2. Second block: [4, 4] -> [4, 5] => Bottom-right is 5
3. Third block: [4, 4] -> [4, 0] => Bottom-right is 0, so we take 4 (top-left)
4. Fourth block: [5, 0] -> [0, 0] => Bottom-right is 0, so we take 5 (top-left)
5. Fifth block: [0, 4] -> [4, 5] => Bottom-right is 5
6. Sixth block: [4, 5] -> [5, 5] => Bottom-right is 5
7. Seventh block: [4, 4] -> [4, 5] => Bottom-right is 5
8. Eighth block: [5, 0] -> [5, 0] => Bottom-right is 0, so we take 5 (top-left)

Continuing for all blocks we get:
```
[
[4, 5, 4, 4],
[5, 5, 5, 5],
[5, 5, 5, 9],
[4, 9, 9, 9]
]
```

Thus, the output for the test case should be:

3618c87e,"To understand the transformation rule applied in the examples, let’s analyze the changes between the input and output grids:

1. **Example 1:** The initial 1 and the surrounding 5s have been changed such that the 1 has moved down to the row of 5s, and those 5s have spread across the column where the 1 and 5 originally were.
2. **Example 2:** All the 1s have moved downwards into the row with all 5s, while the remaining 5 positions (where 1s were) have been replaced by 5s.
3. **Example 3:** This case involves a more subtle change. The 1s have moved into the positions directly below them only if there was a 5 directly above them; otherwise, they remain unchanged. Additionally, the surrounding 5s adjust their positions based on the new placement of 1s.

From these examples, we can infer the following pattern:
- Any number ‘1’ in the input grid will move one cell down.
- If there is a ‘5’ directly above a ‘1’, that ‘5’ will shift to the position of the ‘1’ after moving the ‘1’ down.
- If there isn’t a ‘5’ directly above a ‘1’, other ‘5’s adjust their positions accordingly to fill the gaps left by the moved ‘1’s.

Let's apply this reasoning to the test case:

**Test Case:**

Input:
```python
[
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 5, 0, 5],
 [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
]
```

Following the inferred rule:
- The ‘1’s at positions (2, 2) and (2, 4) will move down to (3, 2) and (3, 4).
- There is no ‘5’ directly above the ‘1’ at (2, 2), so the ‘5’ at (3, 2) stays put.
- Similarly, there is no ‘5’ directly above the ‘1’ at (2, 4), so the ‘5’ at (3, 4) stays put.
- The ‘5’s fill the gaps where the ‘1’s used to be.

So, the output should be:

Output:
```python
[
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 5, 0, 5],
 [5, 5, 1, 5, 1]
]
```

Thus, the solution for the test case is:

Answer: ```[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 1, 5, 1]]```","[[0 0 0 0 0]

3ac3eb23,"To determine the transformation rule, we need to compare the input and output grids in both examples. 

In Example 1, the input grid begins with [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]. In the output, the first row remains unchanged, but every second row below the first row mirrors that initial pattern, repeating it until the grid's full height is replicated. This suggests a pattern where non-zero values in the first row are repeated in every other row beneath it.

In Example 2, we see an identical pattern. The value 4 is mirrored every other row starting from the first row.

Therefore, the rule seems to involve replicating the non-zero pattern found in the first row of the input grid across every second row while keeping the original rows in between unchanged.

Let's apply this rule to the Test Case:

The input has a first row of [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]. According to the observed rule, this row should repeat itself in every other row while the rest remain zeros.

So, the transformation for the Test Case would look like:

3c9b0459,"To determine the transformation rule applied to these grids, let's examine the changes from the inputs to the outputs in each example:

- In Example 1, the first row [2, 2, 1] is changed to [1, 8, 2]. The elements at the first and third positions remain the same but the element at the second position changes from 2 to 8.
- In Example 2, the first row [9, 2, 4] becomes [2, 9, 2], where the first and last elements swap places, and the middle element switches with the one below it.
- In Example 3, the rows appear to be swapped: the first row [8, 8, 8] moves to the bottom, the last row [8, 5, 5] moves to the top, and the middle row remains unchanged.
- In Example 4, the first row [3, 2, 9] changes to [3, 3, 2], where the first and last elements remain but the middle element duplicates itself. Additionally, the first and last elements of the last row switch places.

Considering these variations, there doesn't seem to be a single consistent rule that applies to all examples independently. However, if we analyze more closely, there appears to be a pattern of rotating the rows and columns, as well as swapping certain elements within those rotations. This is evident when looking at the overall structure and element shifts rather than individual rules per example.

For the Test Grid:
Input
```
[
[6, 4, 4],
[6, 6, 4],
[4, 6, 7]]
```

Based on the observed transformations, let's rotate the rows and adjust column-wise as seen in examples, especially focusing on mirroring and swapping elements as in Example 3 and 4. 

Rotating rows gives:
```
[
[4, 6, 7],
[6, 6, 4],
[6, 4, 4]]
```

Swapping first and last column elements gives:
```
[
[7, 6, 4],
[4, 6, 6],
[4, 4, 6]]
```

Upon closer inspection, a simpler transformation that can fit all these examples involves reversing the order of elements in each row.

So, the transformation rule seems to be reversing each row of the input grid.

Applying this rule to the Test Grid:
```
[
[6, 4, 4],    ->   [4, 4, 6]
[6, 6, 4],    ->   [4, 6, 6]
[4, 6, 7]]    ->   [7, 6, 4]
```

Therefore, the final output grid would be:

ba97ae07,"To figure out the transformation rule, let's first analyze the changes made in each example:

1. In Example 1, the color '8' is replaced by '3' whenever there is an immediate horizontal or vertical adjacency with '3'.
2. In Example 2, the color '6' is replaced by '1' when there is horizontal adjacency with '1', but not vertically.
3. In Example 3, the color '7' is replaced by '1' when there is vertical adjacency with '1', but not horizontally.
4. In Example 4, the color '3' is replaced by '2' when there is horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacency with '2'.

By looking at these examples, we can deduce that the transformation involves merging blocks of adjacent colors into one continuous block of the dominant color within the adjacent block.

For the test case, we'll apply the same logic. We need to merge blocks of '4' that are adjacent to any '5':

846bdb03,"To deduce the transformation rule from the given examples to the output, let's analyze the changes step-by-step:

1. **Identify Non-Zero Values:** The first observation is that in all output grids, only non-zero values from the input grid contribute to the output.
2. **Pattern Formation:** We see that the non-zero values form distinct patterns, usually starting from the edges or corners and wrapping around to the other side, with zeros being removed entirely.

For each input, we can see the following:
- All rows and columns containing only zeros in the input are completely eliminated in the output.
- The remaining elements are rearranged into a smaller grid while preserving the order of non-zero values horizontally and vertically.

Let’s apply these rules to the test case:

### Test Case Analysis:
Input:
```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 0, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

Output:
The first and last rows of the input grid contain non-zero values and are thus relevant. Similarly, the columns with non-zero values are those including 4, 2, and 8. We can extract this relevant part:

- Rows with non-zero values (excluding the padding zeros): rows 1, 2, 6, and 10 - 12.
- Columns with non-zero values: columns 1, 2, 8, and 12.

So our output should be the non-zero values of these rows and columns combined in the same order:

```python
[
[4, 0, 0, 0, 4],
[2, 2, 8],
[2, 2, 8],
[2, 2, 8],
[2, 2, 8],
[4, 0, 0, 0, 4],
[8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2],
[8, 0, 2],
[8, 0, 2, 2]
]
```
We notice though that the output has to be a neat rectangular shape with preserved pattern and order. Therefore, we need to adjust the above structure to match the output format and ensure a consistent width.

By examining the final structure of the outputs, we can deduce that the output preserves the minimum bounding rectangle of the non-zero values:

```python
[
[4, 0, 0, 0, 4],
[2, 2, 0, 8, 8],
[2, 0, 0, 8, 8],
[2, 2, 0, 2, 2],
[4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
]
```

After careful examination, we can see that the actual correct solution will remove all extraneous 0s and keep minimal bounding rectangle of non-zero values:
```python
[
[4, 0, 0, 0, 4],
[2, 2, 0, 8, 8],
[2, 0, 8, 8, 8],
[2, 0, 8, 8, 8],
[4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
]
```

This matches the width of the significant non-zero values and maintains their original row-wise pattern.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Answer: ```[[4, 0, 0, 0, 4], [2, 2, 0, 8, 8], [2, 0, 8, 8, 8], [2, 0, 8, 8, 8], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]]```","[[4 0 0 0 4]

10fcaaa3,"To solve this puzzle, let's examine the pattern used in the transformations from the inputs to the outputs provided:

1. Each input row is doubled.
2. Between every pair of duplicated rows, an ""intermediate"" row is inserted. This intermediate row contains the number 8, except where an original non-zero value would fall in that position.
3. If the input has a non-zero value, that value retains its position in the output, but the rows get interspersed with the intermediate rows.

Following these steps, we can now apply them to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Step 1: Double each row.
```
[
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Step 2: Insert an intermediate row containing the number 8 after each duplicated row, except where there is a non-zero value.
```
[
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 0, 8, 0, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Step 3: Combine all rows according to the pattern.
```
[
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8],
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]
]
```

However, upon further reflection, we notice that the resulting row length should be consistent across the output. Since the original length was 5, inserting an intermediate row doubles the width. Therefore, the pattern should be applied such that each intermediate row and original row form a block of 10 columns (doubled length).

Applying the correct pattern, we obtain:
```

d9f24cd1,"To figure out the transformation rule applied to the grid from input to output, let's analyze the given examples.

In Example 1, we start with an input grid that has some 5s and a single row at the bottom with 2s. In the output, those 5s are preserved in their positions, but every row above that has been filled with 2s starting from the second column. 

In Example 2, there are several 5s scattered across the middle rows, and a single row at the bottom with 2s. The transformation here is similar; each row above the bottom row gets filled with 2s in positions that correspond to where there was a 5 or a 2 below.

Based on these observations, it seems like the rule might be:

- If there is a non-zero value (other than 2) in a cell in any row, replicate that non-zero value in the corresponding cell in all rows above.
- Then fill all remaining cells in those rows with 2s instead of 0s.

Let's apply this rule to the Test case:

- There are 5s present in several rows in the input grid, starting from the third row downwards. We'll replicate these 5s in all rows above them, while filling all other cells with 2s since they're 0s in the original grid.

The Test case input and its application of the rule would result in the following output:

67a423a3,"To find the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the corresponding output grids, let's examine each example carefully.

In Example 1, we notice that all zeros in the third column of the input grid are replaced with fours in the output grid, and the same happens with the first and fourth columns. The second column remains unchanged, which contains only twos and threes.

In Example 2, we see a similar pattern where the zeros surrounding the sixes in the middle row have been replaced with fours. Additionally, the zeros right above and below the sixes also turned into fours while maintaining the boundary condition where surrounding rows and columns did not change.

In Example 3, the transformation targets the zero cells directly adjacent to the ones and nines on both sides and vertically, changing them to fours while keeping the rest of the cells as they are.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that any cell containing a zero that is directly next to at least one non-zero cell changes to four, while the other cells remain unchanged.

Applying the same rule to the test case:

The zeros on the edges and corners do not change. However, the zeros that are immediately adjacent to the five or three cells will be changed to four. Let's apply this rule to fill out the test case:

Upon closer inspection, we realize there are no zeros beside a nonzero value except in the seventh row. Therefore, the correct transformation is only needed for the seventh row, where the zeros beside the threes should be replaced with fours.

5582e5ca,"To determine the transformation rule, let's carefully examine the provided examples.

In each example, the output grid is filled with a single number that is present in the input grid. This suggests that we need to identify which number appears most frequently (mode) or if there's a specific rule based on the first occurrence or any other criteria.

However, in all the example outputs, the entire grid is filled with the same number, which is consistently the first non-zero number encountered in the input grid when read row-wise and column-wise.

Let's apply this reasoning to the test case:
- First row: [8, 8, 6]
- Second row: [4, 6, 9]
- Third row: [8, 3, 0]

When read row-wise and column-wise, the numbers appear in this sequence: 8, 8, 6, 4, 6, 9, 8, 3, 0.
The first non-zero number we encounter is 8.

Thus, the output should be a grid filled entirely with the number 8.

234bbc79,"To determine the transformation rule applied to these examples, let's analyze the patterns in the inputs and outputs.

Upon careful inspection, we notice that the transformation involves changing the color values based on neighboring patterns. Specifically, if two adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically) have different integers other than zero, they are replaced with the minimum value among those two integers. For cells that have zeros next to them, their value remains the same. Here's a breakdown of the change process:

- Example 1:
    - The '5' surrounded by '2's becomes '2'.
    - The '5' surrounded by '0's and '2's stays as '5', but after the processing of its neighbors, it transforms into '2'.
    - '1' and '5' next to each other become '1'.

- Example 2:
    - The '5' next to '2's becomes '2'.
    - The '5' next to '3's becomes '3'.
    - The '1' surrounded by '5's and '0's becomes '0' (as it is not surrounded by a single consistent neighbor other than '0').

- Example 3:
    - The '5's next to '2's and '8's become '2's.
    - Similarly, the '5' next to '8's becomes '8'.
    - The '8's next to '5's and '2's become '2's.

- Example 4:
    - The '5's next to '1's and '2's become '1's.
    - The '5' between '2's becomes '2'.
    - The '2's surrounded by '1's and '5's become '1's.

Applying this rule to the test case, here is the step-by-step analysis:
1. First row: 
    - '5' next to '0' remains '5', but after processing neighbors, it becomes '0'.
    - '5' next to '1' and '0' becomes '1'.
    - '5' next to '0' and '8' becomes '8'.
    
2. Second row:
    - '5' next to '2' and '0' becomes '2'.
    - '1' next to '1' and '0' remains '1'.
    - '5' next to '3' and '0' becomes '3'.
    - '3' next to '0' and '8' becomes '8'.
    
3. Third row:
    - No changes needed here since all non-zero adjacent pairs would lead to a conflict or involve zeros which do not change their neighbors.

Therefore, the solution for the test case is:
Answer: ``` [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]```","[[0 0 0 0 0 8 0]

08ed6ac7,"To figure out the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Observation in Example 1:**
- Every occurrence of `5` in the input is replaced with `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4` in the output.
- The replacement seems to occur based on the distance from the edge of the grid where `5` appears first horizontally or vertically.

Let's break down the pattern:

1. If a `5` appears in the first column of the grid, it is replaced by `1`.
2. If a `5` appears in the second column of the grid, it is replaced by `2`.
3. If a `5` appears in the third column of the grid, it is replaced by `3`.
4. If a `5` appears in the fourth column of the grid, it is replaced by `4`.

Similarly, when `5` appears for the first time in a row, the replacement rule applies to all subsequent `5`s in that row based on their distance from the first column that contains a `5`.

**Analysis of Example 2:**

In Example 2, we see a similar pattern but with vertical and horizontal replacements combined:

1. The first column with `5` is at index 1, so `5` in those columns is replaced by `1`.
2. The first row with `5` is at index 7, so `5` in those rows is replaced by `4`.
3. For cells that have `5` after the first appearance in both directions, the replacement is calculated as follows:
   - For cells appearing in the 2nd column: `2`
   - After the first vertical `5`, cells appearing in the 4th column: `2`

Following these rules, we can solve the test case:

**Test Case Analysis:**

1. The first column with `5` is at index 1.
2. The first row with `5` is at index 1.
3. So, for every cell with `5`, its position relative to the first `5` in its respective column and row will dictate the replacement value.

Let's apply the transformation to the test case:

First column with `5`: Column index 1
First row with `5`: Row index 1

The resulting transformation should follow the pattern:

- First column (index 1): All `5`s in this column should be `1`s.
- First row (index 1): All `5`s in this row should be `1`s.
- Second appearance of `5` in the column (index 7): should replace `5` with `2`.
- Second appearance of `5` in the row (index 3): should replace `5` with `2`.
- Third appearance of `5` in the column (index 4, 5, 6): should replace `5` with `3`.
- Third appearance of `5` in the row (index 4, 5, 6): should replace `5` with `3`.
- For cells appearing in the 7th row (last row) and 8th row (where the `5` appears in both directions for the fourth time): should replace `5` with `4`.

bbc9ae5d,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the behavior of each example:

1. Each input grid has one or more consecutive cells with the same color.
2. In the corresponding output grid, that sequence of consecutive cells with the same color is extended downwards in a triangular fashion until it hits a zero or the end of the row.

For instance, in Example 1, the input `[1, 1]` leads to extending `1`s down two rows, forming a triangle. Similarly, in Example 2, the sequence `[2, 2, 2]` extends down three rows, making the output a triangle with height four.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:
- The input consists of three consecutive `1`s followed by zeros. Therefore, we should extend these `1`s in a downward triangular manner until the grid ends or hits a zero.

So, the solution would be a grid where `1`s form a triangle with height four:

f5b8619d,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's analyze the provided examples.

First, in Example 1, the input has dimensions 3x3, and the output is 6x6. Each element of the input appears twice horizontally and vertically in the output. Specifically, for any element (i, j) in the input, there are elements at positions (2*i, 2*j), (2*i+1, 2*j), (2*i, 2*j+1), and (2*i+1, 2*j+1) in the output. If the input value is zero, then two zeros are placed in the corresponding horizontal positions in the output and two '8's in the corresponding vertical positions.

In Example 2, the original input is 6x6, and the output is 12x12 with a similar pattern. Each cell of the input is repeated four times both horizontally and vertically in the output grid.

Lastly, in Example 3, the input is 2x2, and the output is 4x4 where each cell of the input is repeated twice in both directions (horizontal and vertical).

From these examples, we can deduce that the transformation rule is to double the size of the grid both in rows and columns, and fill the new cells with a color value based on their location relative to the doubled input size. For every non-zero input value, those values are replicated across the new output cell positions. Each zero in the input results in filling with the value '8' in the vertical cells and maintaining '0' in the corresponding horizontal cells in the output.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:

The dimensions of the test case are 4x4. Therefore, the output should have dimensions 8x8. We apply the rule by replicating each cell of the test case into four new cells in the output.

Input: 
[
[0, 0, 3, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 3],

[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Note: We keep the 3's in the same position in the doubled grid and fill their surrounding cells with zeros. Each original zero is replaced with '0' in the top-left quarter and '8' in the bottom-right quarter of the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid.

Thus, the final output for the test case is:
Answer: ```[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]```

In Example 1:
- There are several segments of the number '5' present in the input grid.
- In the output grid, these segments are replaced with different patterns of numbers.
- Each pattern appears to follow a specific rule based on its position within the original segment of '5'.

Looking at the first three rows where there's a vertical column of five '5's, the output shows a pattern that starts with '1', goes to '4' and '2' alternately, and ends with '1':
```
[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

```

The same pattern applies to the horizontal segments of '5's starting around row 6:
```
[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5] -> [0, 1, 4, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 4, 1]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 4, 1]
```

Applying the same logic to Example 2:
- The vertical columns of '5's show the same transformation pattern as described above.
- For horizontal segments, the transformation also follows the same pattern, but the direction starts with '1' from the left if the segment is on the left side of the grid, and starts with '1' from the right if the segment is on the right side of the grid.

Let's apply this rule to the Test Case:
For the vertical segment in columns 2-5, the transformation starts with '1' at the top, alternates between '4' and '2', and ends with '1' at the bottom:

```

For the horizontal segment starting from row 8:
```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4]

Putting it all together, the transformed grid should look like:

e8593010,"To determine the transformation rule from the input to the output grids, we need to analyze how the 0s in the input grid are being mapped to different numbers in the output grid.

- In Example 1, the original zeros are replaced with numbers that seem to depend on their neighboring 5's.
- In Example 2, the zeros are similarly replaced, but with different values (2, 3) based on surrounding 5's.
- In Example 3, the pattern continues, with the zeros being replaced according to the number of adjacent 5's in various directions (right, down, left, up).

Analyzing these patterns more closely:

1. If a zero has a 5 above it, it gets a 1.
2. If a zero has a 5 below it, it gets a 2.
3. If a zero has a 5 to its right, it gets a 3.
4. If a zero has a 5 to its left, it gets a 4.
5. Zeros may have combinations of these neighbors, leading to sums of these values.

However, the examples also show that the values can vary, suggesting a more specific rule than simple directional sums. Instead, it appears that each 0 is replaced with a distinct value based on the presence of 5's directly adjacent to it, rather than any combination of directions.

Given this observation, let's apply the rule to the test case:

For Example 1:

[2, 2, 2],
[1, 1, 1]]

Output:
Columns are [1], [1], [1,2]. It keeps the first distinct column encountered, which is [1].

For Example 2:
Input:
```
[

Output:
Since all columns are identical, the result is the first column [3, 4, 6] only.

025d127b,"To solve the puzzle and understand the transformation rule applied from the input to the output, let's analyze the examples provided:

In Example 1:
- The input has a central vertical strip of 6s that span across several rows.
- The output keeps only the outermost and second outermost columns of 6s intact while removing the inner columns of 6s.

In Example 2:
- Similar behavior can be observed with the column of 8s. The outermost and the next column inwards are kept while the rest are removed.

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:
- For each column, if there is a color present in the middle rows but not at the top or bottom row of that column, those colors are removed from the result. Only the colors that appear in the top or bottom rows or their immediate next inwards columns are retained.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:
- In the Test Case, the 4s form a similar central vertical pattern, with outer columns of 4s being adjacent to inner columns of 4s.
- Following the rule, we should keep the outermost and the second outermost columns containing 4s, and remove all other columns of 4s.

54d82841,"To figure out the pattern, I'll compare each cell in both the input and output for the training examples.

In each example, we notice that the transformation occurs only on rows where there's no color present (i.e., all cells contain 0), and only in the rightmost columns. Specifically:

- In Example 1, the last two blank rows had their 4th and 8th columns turned into 4.
- In Example 2, the last blank row had its 3rd and 5th columns turned into 4.
- In Example 3, the last blank row had its 4th and 8th columns turned into 4, while the row before that had its 7th and 11th columns turned into 4.

From these patterns, we can deduce that the rule is to change the 4th and 8th columns to 4 in the last non-color-containing row if the grid has at least 8 columns, and change the 3rd and 5th columns to 4 in the last row if the grid has fewer than 8 columns.

Since the test case has 11 columns and the last row that doesn't have any colors in it is the 5th row, we apply the rule to the 4th and 8th columns of this row.

f76d97a5,"First, I'll analyze the pattern in the provided examples:

- In Example 1, all the occurrences of 5 inside the grid become 4, while 4 at the borders of the grid becomes 0.
- In Example 2, all the occurrences of 5 inside the grid become 6, while 6 at the borders of the grid becomes 0.
- In Example 3, all the occurrences of 9 inside the grid become 0, while 5 at the borders of the grid becomes 0.

The common transformation appears to be setting the numbers in the interior positions of the grid equal to the number that surrounds them, and changing border positions to 0 if they match the number being replaced in the interior.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[3, 3, 3, 5, 3],
[3, 5, 3, 3, 3],
[3, 5, 5, 3, 5],
[3, 3, 3, 5, 3],
[5, 5, 5, 3, 3]]
```

Interior positions surrounded by 3s: These should change from 5 to 3.
Border positions with 3 or 5: These should become 0.

Applying this transformation:

New grid:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0],
[0, 3, 0, 3, 0],
[0, 3, 3, 0, 3],
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0],
[5, 5, 5, 0, 0]]
```

However, we notice that only the ""5"" surrounded by ""3""s in the interior are actually transformed. The rule seems to be replacing the inner ""5"" with ""3"", but not affecting the ""3""s on the border or any other ""5""s except those surrounded by ""3""s.

So, the correct grid after applying the transformation would be:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0],
[0, 3, 0, 3, 0],
[0, 3, 3, 0, 3],
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0],

3bd67248,"To determine the transformation rule, let's observe how the elements in the grid change from the provided examples.

### Observations:
1. **Fixed Values**: All cells that start with a non-zero value (e.g., 6, 5, 8, 3) remain unchanged.
2. **Pattern in Zeros**: The zeros at the end of each row seem to be replaced with incremental values (beginning from 2) depending on their position within the row, and eventually all zeros in the last few rows are replaced with the number 4.

Let's describe the process more clearly:

- For each row, starting from the last element to the first, we replace zeros with increasing numbers, beginning from 2.
- We continue this replacement until we hit a non-zero value, after which all remaining zeros in that row get the maximum value used in the previous row's replacement (which begins at 4).

### Analyzing the Test Case:
The test grid starts with 3s and ends with zeros. Let's apply the pattern described above:

**Input**:
```
[
[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

We'll work through each row one by one, according to the rule:

- The first row starts with 3, so we replace the zeros with 2 towards the end.
- The second row starts with 3, so we replace the zeros with 2, but also consider the maximum value from the previous row (2), to fill the rest of the row with this max value.
- This continues for the subsequent rows, with zeros being replaced by 2, then by 4, and any further zeros getting filled with the max value of what was used previously, which is 4 in this case.

Applying this rule:

  - Each `5` moves up by one row.
  - Each `8` moves up by two rows.
  - Each `2` moves up by one row.
  - Each `1` moves up by one row.
  
The pattern seems to be that all non-zero numbers move up by one row, with the constraint that they don't move beyond the top boundary of the grid. Additionally, if there are multiple instances of the same number in a row, when moved up together, they occupy the consecutive columns available starting from the leftmost possible spot in their new row.

- Applying the rule:
  - Move all `5`s up one row.
  - Move all `3`s up one row.
  - Move both `2`s up one row.
  - Move both `8`s up two rows.
  - Move all `6`s up one row.

3. In Example 3, the number `7` at row 6, column 2 gets shifted up to row 5, column 2. The number `3` at row 6, column 10 and `7` at row 14, column 9 get shifted up and left accordingly.

In all these examples, non-zero numbers move upwards or to the left, filling the upper left portion of the grid with their values and leaving zeros below or to the right of them.

Now let's apply this rule to the test case:

- The `3`s in rows 1 and 4 should move upward.
- The `2` in row 4 should stay put after all upwards moves.
- The `7`s in rows 7 and 13 should move upward, and the `1` in row 7 should also move upward.
- Any remaining zero positions should be filled with zeros.

Applying the rule carefully, we get the following output for the test case:

d4a91cb9,"To figure out the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's first analyze the changes in the examples provided.

In Example 1, the number 8 at position (2, 1) leads to filling the column below with 4s up until the next non-zero value (which is 2 at row 8), thus stopping at that point.

In Example 2, the number 2 at position (1, 7) leads to filling the rows to the right with 4s up until the next non-zero value (which is 8 at row 1, column 8), and the number 8 at position (1, 8) leads to filling the column below with 4s.

In Example 3, the number 8 at position (9, 8) and number 2 at position (2, 9) each fill their respective columns and rows with 4s until they reach another non-zero value or the edge of the grid.

The common pattern is that any non-zero integer in the input grid (except for the last occurrence in its row/column direction) fills the entire row to the right or column below with the number 4, until another non-zero integer is encountered, which stops the filling.

Applying this logic to the test case, we observe that there is an 8 starting at position (3, 3) and a 2 at position (2, 11). Therefore, all the positions in the columns below these non-zero values, except where another non-zero value occurs, should be filled with 4s.

Let's apply this rule:

- The 8 at (3, 3) will cause all entries directly below it in the column to be replaced with 4s.
- The 2 at (2, 11) will cause all entries directly to the left and above it in that row to be replaced with 4s, but since it's at the end of the row, only the column needs to be modified.

So the transformation looks like this:

4be741c5,"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given examples to find the transformation rule.

In Example 1:
- The input contains several rows of repeating color patterns.
- The output is a list of unique colors found in the input, with each color representing one distinct row of colors.

In Example 2:
- The input shows different groups of numbers in distinct rows.
- The output contains those numbers that appear in their own separate rows.

In Example 3:
- The input has various sequences of numbers, where some numbers are separated by others.
- The output lists these numbers vertically based on their individual occurrence in their own distinct rows.

From these observations, it seems that the rule is to take each distinct row from the input grid and extract the first unique non-zero (or non-background) color from it, moving from top to bottom. Rows with identical or repetitive patterns are reduced to a single row in the output containing the unique color at the beginning of that pattern.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- First row: [3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8] -> unique color 3
- Second row: [3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8] -> unique color 3
- Third row: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8] -> unique color 3
- Fourth row: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8] -> unique color 3
- Fifth row: [3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8] -> unique color 2
- Sixth row: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8] -> unique color 3
- Seventh row: [3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8] -> unique color 3
- Eighth row: [3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8] -> unique color 3
- Ninth row: [3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8] -> unique color 3
- Tenth row: [3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8] -> unique color 3
- Eleventh row: [3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8] -> unique color 3
- Twelfth row: [3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8] -> unique color 3
- Thirteenth row: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8] -> unique color 3
- Fourteenth row: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8] -> unique color 3

29c11459,"To determine the transformation rule, I'll analyze the differences between the inputs and outputs provided in the training examples.

In Example 1, we have an input where there's a '1' at position (1, 1) and a '2' at position (1, 10). In the output, the number '1' extends its color (1) across the row to the right until it meets with the color '2', and the area between them changes to '5'.

In Example 2, we have a similar pattern; the numbers '3' and '7' at positions (3, 1) and (3, 10) respectively extend their colors across the row, with '5' filling the space between them.

Following these patterns, here's how we can interpret the transformation rule:

- When there is a non-zero number on the left side of the row, it will spread horizontally to the right until it encounters another non-zero number.
- The area between two different non-zero numbers will be filled with the number '5'.
- All zero entries remain unchanged.
- The rightmost non-zero entry spreads leftwards as far as possible without overlapping other colors.

Now let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]]
```

Output:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]]
```

So, applying the rule:
- The '4' spreads rightwards to the sixth column (where '8' starts).
- The '8' spreads leftwards from its starting position until it meets '4'.
- Between the '4' and '8', the cell values become '5'.

The same happens with '6' and '9' in the fifth row, resulting in '5' being the value between them.

From the comparison, we can see that whenever there is a contiguous block of `1`s, they get replaced by a sequence of `1`s followed by `2`s. The transformation rule seems to be replacing every pair of consecutive `1`s with `1` then `2`, while preserving single `1`s. This process appears to be repeated horizontally.

Since the third example was identical to the test case and had no changes, the transformations should follow the same pattern for contiguous blocks of `1`s. Applying that transformation:

- Contiguous blocks of `1`s in rows 2 and 3 are transformed to `1` and `2`.
- Contiguous blocks of `1`s in rows 8 and 11 are also transformed in similar fashion.
  
Let's apply this logic to our test case:

Answer: ```

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```
The output remains exactly the same as the input because the pattern here does not introduce any new contiguous blocks of `1`s that need to be transformed.

Therefore, the Answer for the test case is:

995c5fa3,"To solve this puzzle, I'll analyze the given examples to understand the transformation rule applied.

First, let's observe each example:

- Example 1: The pattern in the input grid has a repeated sequence of [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5] which can be split into two parts: [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5] and [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5]. Each part of the sequence in the input repeats vertically (each sequence appears twice) and the output is a reduced version of these sequences with different color codes.
- Example 2: Here, the input sequence [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5] also gets repeated twice vertically but with some variations within the sequence, leading to a different set of color codes in the output.
- Example 3: In this case, the sequence [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5] and [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5] appear, along with some variations, resulting in yet another distinct output grid.
- Example 4: Similar to Example 1, we see a straightforward repetition of the sequence [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5], leading to an output that closely resembles the output of Example 1, but with slight differences based on the variations within the sequences.

After careful observation, it seems that the transformation rule is related to the frequency of zeros ('0') relative to the fives ('5') in specific segments of the input grid:
- If there's one '0' before and after four '5's, the output will contain '2'.
- When there are two '0's within these six elements, the output contains '4'.
- If there's a single '0' at the end of the segment, the output contains '8'.

Given the test case:
Input: 
```
[
[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],
[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5],
[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5],
[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]]
```

Let's break down the transformation:
- For the first row, we have a sequence [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5] repeated twice. According to the pattern, one '0' between five '5's results in '2'.
- For the second row, [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5] has two '0's in a segment, so it should result in '4'.
- Third row, [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5] also has two '0's in a segment, so it should result in '4'.
- Fourth row, [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5] again has one '0' before and after four '5's, so it should result in '2'.

Therefore, the output for the test case would be:
Answer: ```[[2, 2, 2], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2]]```","[[2 2 2]

6d0aefbc,"To figure out the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's analyze the examples:

In Example 1, the input grid is:
```
[
[6, 6, 6],
[1, 6, 1],
[8, 8, 6]]
```

And the output grid is:
```
[
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
[1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1],
[8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8]]
```

Here, we see that each row of the input is duplicated and then added to the original array, resulting in doubling the width of every row.

In Example 2, the input grid is:
```
[
[6, 8, 1],
[6, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 6]]
```

The output grid is:
```
[
[6, 8, 1, 1, 8, 6],
[6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6],
[1, 1, 6, 6, 1, 1]]
```

Again, each row is duplicated and appended to itself.

Following this pattern through all other examples confirms that the rule involves duplicating each value horizontally within each row.

So, the transformation rule appears to be: For each row, duplicate the numbers horizontally.

For the Test Case:
Input:
```
[
[6, 8, 6],
[8, 6, 8],
[1, 6, 1]]
```

Applying the rule, we get:
Output:

6e19193c,"To find the pattern applied to the examples, I'll analyze the changes from each input to the corresponding output:

In Example 1:
- The color '7' appears in rows 3 and 4.
- The output places '7' diagonally across these rows, starting from the position where '7' first appears moving towards the opposite end.

In Example 2:
- The color '9' appears in rows 2, 3, 7, and 8.
- The output spreads '9' to adjacent columns on both sides of its appearance in these rows, creating a diagonal cross effect.

The transformation rule appears to be:
- For each row that contains a specific color (like '7' or '9'), that color is spread out to all cells along a diagonal line from its first appearance to the edge of the grid, in both directions.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:
- The color '8' appears in row 5, column 8.
- The color '8' appears in row 4, columns 4 and 5.
- The color '8' appears in row 3, column 6.
- The color '8' appears in rows 7 and 8.

Based on the rule we've established, the Test Case should have '8's diagonally spread out, moving from the point of their initial appearance.

From these examples, we observe that:
- All '1' and '2' are replaced with '3'.
- All '0's remain unchanged.
- All other numbers do not appear in the final output.
- The rows from the fifth row down in the input are ignored.

Given these transformations, the rule seems to be:
1. Replace '1' and '2' with '3'.
2. Remove all rows from the input starting from the fifth row downwards.
3. Maintain the structure of the remaining rows, preserving zeros where they exist.

Let's apply this transformation rule to the test case:

928ad970,"To figure out the transformation rule applied to these grid puzzles, let's break down the changes seen in the provided examples.

### Example Analysis:

**Example 1:**
- In the input grid, there was a single '5' in the middle column at the top and bottom.
- The transformation expanded those '5's into vertical stripes on their respective columns.
- Additionally, where there was a cluster of '1's surrounded by '0's, it turned into a larger square shape surrounding the original '1's.

**Example 2:**
- Here, there was a single '5' in the middle row of the 7th row from the top.
- As in the first example, the '5' expanded vertically into a stripe in the 7th column.
- The '3's formed a similar pattern as the '1's in Example 1, expanding outward to form a larger square shape around them.

**Example 3:**
- The single '5' in the 6th row of the 7th column also expanded vertically into a stripe.
- The '4's similarly expanded outward to form a larger square shape.

### Transformation Rule Determination:
From the observations above, we can conclude the following rules:
1. **Single Color Expansion:** Any single color (like '5') in the middle of the grid expands vertically into a stripe along its column.
2. **Cluster Color Expansion:** If there is a cluster of one color (like '1', '3', or '4'), the transformation spreads that color outward in a square-like structure around the cluster.

### Applying the Rule to Test Case:
Let's apply the identified rules to the test case:
- There is a '5' in the second row of the eighth column. This '5' will expand vertically into a stripe along the eighth column.
- There is an '8' cluster surrounded by '0's in row 6, spanning across columns 6 to 9. This cluster will spread outward in a square-like structure around itself.

### Solution Step-by-Step:
1. Identify the vertical expansion of '5'.
2. Identify the cluster of '8' and its expansion.

```

#### Vertical Stripe for '5':
- The '5' in the 2nd row of the 8th column will expand into a vertical stripe along the 8th column.
- Another '5' in the 14th row of the 6th column will expand into a vertical stripe along the 6th column.

#### Cluster for '8':
- The '8's in rows 6 and 8 spanning columns 6 to 9 will expand the '8's upwards and downwards by 1 row, and left and right by 1 column.

af902bf9,"To find out the transformation rule that was applied to the training examples to generate their corresponding outputs, let's analyze the changes made in each example:

### Example 1 Analysis:
- The input grid has two instances of the number `4` directly next to each other in the fourth row.
- In the output grid, these pairs of `4`s have generated a new `2` value immediately below them, in the fifth row.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- There are two `4`s horizontally aligned in the second and seventh rows.
- Between them, in the third through sixth rows, there appears a vertical strip of `2`s.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- There is a single `4` in the first row at the third column and another one at the seventh column.
- Below these `4`s in the third row, there is a `2` in the third and seventh columns respectively.
- Additionally, there is a horizontal line of `4`s in the seventh row. Below it, starting from the eighth row, there are two consecutive rows filled with `2`s, centered under the horizontal line of `4`s.

From these observations, we can deduce that:

- When there are consecutive `4`s horizontally, they create a vertical strip of `2`s directly below them, extending downwards for the same length as the consecutive `4`s.
- When there are consecutive `4`s vertically, they create a horizontal strip of `2`s directly to the right of them, extending rightwards for the same length as the consecutive `4`s.

### Solving the Test Case:
Given the input grid below:
```
[
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

1. **Horizontal Pairs:**
   - Row 1: Has `4` followed by `0`, then another `4`. This creates two isolated `4`s.
   - Row 5: Also has `4` followed by `0`, then another `4`. This again creates two isolated `4`s.
   
   Since these `4`s are not consecutive without zeroes in between, no additional `2` values are created from them.

2. **Vertical Pairs:**
   - Column 6: Has `4` in row 1 and row 5. This creates a `2` in the row directly below each `4`.
     - Row 2: `0` -> `2`
     - Row 6: `4` -> `2`
     
   - Column 6 also has `4` in row 6 and row 9. This creates a `2` in the row directly below row 6 (`7`) and row 9 (`10`).
     - Row 7: `0` -> `2`
     - Row 10: `0` -> `2`

Thus, the output grid should contain `2` where these transformations occur.

[6, 6, 2, 0],
[7, 0, 4, 4],

```

Observation:
- In each of the examples, the transformation appears to be based on the first non-zero value in each row of the input grid.
- Each output row contains elements that are present in the corresponding input row, but only the first non-zero value in each input row is carried over to the output.
- If there are no non-zero values in an input row, the output row is empty or filled with zeros, depending on the context.

For the test case:
The input is:
```
[
[3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5]]
```

Following the pattern observed in the examples, the output should be:
```
[
[3],
[],
[8],
[8],
[8],
[8],
[8],
[8],
[],
[7]]
```

However, since the output has to match the format given in the examples exactly, we take the first non-zero element from each row of the input grid and fit them into an appropriate structure. For the test case, the structure seems to be based on consecutive appearances of non-zero values. Here's the matching output pattern:
```
[
[3],
[],
[8],
[8],
[8],
[8],
[8],
[8],
[],
[7, 5]]
```

But to match the exact format of the examples, we need to consider the size of the output grids. It looks like the output size is based on the number of rows in the input grid that contain the color 8 (which is the pattern followed by Examples 2 and 3).

So, taking only rows containing the color 8 and considering the non-zero entries, we get:
```
[
[8],
[8],
[8],
[8],
[8],
[8],
[8],
[8]]
```
This results in an incorrect size, as we must follow the Example 3 format where the number of entries matches the longest sequence of consecutive 8s.

Therefore, the correct approach aligning all examples is to extract the first non-zero value from every row and form a new grid where each column represents the consecutive first non-zero values from each column of the original grid. 

Test Case Result:
```
[
[3, 4],
[8, 0],
[8, 0],
[8, 0],
[8, 8],
[8, 0],
[8, 8],
[8, 0],
[7, 5]]
```

Upon rechecking, the most consistent rule among the examples is extracting the first non-zero value from every row and forming columns based on those, but the given examples have varying formats. Since the latest hint suggests a pattern of consecutive non-zeros and we see that some examples end up being smaller grids, the final rule appears to be compressing each column and only retaining the first non-zero entry from each row.

So, the final answer should be:
```
[
[3, 4],
[8, 5]]
```

Thus, the test case should be transformed to:
Answer: ```[[3, 4], [8, 5]]```","[[3 4]
 [8 5]]",True,False,0.0
cbded52d,"To figure out the transformation applied to the grid, let's analyze the differences between the input and output in the provided examples:

- In Example 1, the color at position `[4][3]` and `[4][5]` changed from `1` to `2` in the output.
- In Example 2, the color at position `[3][3]` and `[3][5]` changed from `1` to `7` and at position `[4][7]` changed from `1` to `3`.
- In Example 3, the color at position `[4][3]` and `[4][5]` changed from `1` to `3`.

Upon close examination, we can deduce that the pattern involves the following rules:
1. If the value `1` appears directly above or below an even number (like `2`, `4`), it is changed to match that even number.
2. If the value `1` appears directly above or below an odd number (like `3`, `7`), it is changed to that odd number.

Let's apply these rules to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
[1, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 8],

[6, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 6, 1],
[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 8]]
```

Following the rules:
- The `1`s at positions `[0][0]` and `[0][7]` are right next to `1` but not directly above or below, so they stay unchanged.
- The `1`s at positions `[0][1]`, `[0][5]`, `[0][3]`, `[2][3]`, `[2][5]`, `[2][7]`, `[4][6]`, `[6][0]`, `[6][3]`, `[6][5]`, `[6][7]`, `[7][3]`, `[7][5]`, `[7][7]` remain unchanged because they either have no adjacent cells with different numbers or are not directly surrounded by any specific number according to our pattern.
- The `1`s at positions `[1][1]`, `[1][7]`, `[6][1]`, and `[7][1]` are directly above or below `8`, so they change to `8`.

49d1d64f,"Let's analyze the transformation rule based on the training examples:

1. **Structure Analysis**: Each input grid is transformed into an output grid that has twice the number of rows and columns compared to the original.
   
   - Example 1 Input Grid: 2x2 -> Example 1 Output Grid: 4x4
   - Example 2 Input Grid: 2x3 -> Example 2 Output Grid: 4x6
   - Example 3 Input Grid: 3x3 -> Example 3 Output Grid: 5x5
   
   This observation suggests that each element in the input grid gets duplicated in both dimensions.

2. **Element Transformation**: For each element in the input grid, the corresponding positions in the output grid are filled with the same value. There are also additional border elements around the outer edge of the grid which are all zero (0).

   For Example 1:
   - The element at position (1, 1) in the input grid (value: 2) translates to positions (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), and (3, 3) in the output grid.
   - The element at position (1, 2) in the input grid (value: 8) translates to positions (2, 4) and (3, 4).
   - The element at position (2, 1) in the input grid (value: 3) translates to positions (4, 2) and (4, 3).
   - All outer edges of the output grid are zeros (0).

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:
- Duplicate the grid in both dimensions.
- Add a border of zeros around the new grid.

c8cbb738,"To determine the transformation rule from the provided inputs and outputs, let's analyze the changes in each given case.

### Example 1 Analysis
The input grid is 11 columns wide and 12 rows high with varying colors. The output grid is 5 columns wide and 5 rows high.

- The first row of the output corresponds to the middle five numbers (columns 4 through 8) of the first row of the input.
- The second row of the output corresponds to the middle five numbers of the third row of the input.
- The third row of the output corresponds to the middle five numbers of the fifth row of the input.
- The fourth row of the output corresponds to the middle five numbers of the ninth row of the input.
- The final row of the output corresponds to the middle five numbers of the eleventh row of the input.

In essence, the transformation involves selecting the middle column segment of certain rows from the input grid and constructing the output grid with those segments.

### Example 2 Analysis
The input grid is 8 columns wide and 10 rows high. The output grid is 3 columns wide and 3 rows high.

- The first row of the output corresponds to the middle three numbers (columns 3 through 5) of the second row of the input.
- The second row of the output corresponds to the middle three numbers of the fourth row of the input.
- The third row of the output corresponds to the middle three numbers of the eighth row of the input.

Again, the selection involves picking the middle column segment of specific rows from the input grid and arranging them in the output.

### Example 3 Analysis
The input grid is 19 columns wide and 12 rows high. The output grid is 5 columns wide and 5 rows high.

- The first row of the output corresponds to the middle five numbers (columns 7 through 11) of the third row of the input.
- The second row of the output corresponds to the middle five numbers of the sixth row of the input.
- The third row of the output corresponds to the middle five numbers of the seventh row of the input.
- The fourth row of the output corresponds to the middle five numbers of the tenth row of the input.
- The final row of the output corresponds to the middle five numbers of the twelfth row of the input.

Each row and column selection in the output seems consistent with taking the middle part of the specified rows.

### Test Case
The test input grid has 19 columns wide and 16 rows high. Following the pattern observed in the examples, we would select the middle column segment (columns 8 through 12) of every alternate row starting from the second row:

- Input grid row 2 gives us [8, 8, 8, 8, 8] (columns 8 through 12).
- Input grid row 4 gives us [8, 8, 8, 8, 8].
- Input grid row 6 gives us [1, 8, 8, 8, 1].
- Input grid row 8 gives us [8, 2, 8, 8, 8].
- Input grid row 10 gives us [1, 8, 2, 8, 2].

### Example Analysis

**Example 1**
- **Input**: 
  ```
  [
  [0, 2, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```
- **Output**: 
  ```
  [
  [0, 4, 0],
  [0, 2, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```
- Here, the value `2` in the first row and second column has been doubled from `2` to `4`. All other zeros remain unchanged.

**Example 2**
- **Input**: 
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 6, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```
- **Output**: 
  ```
  [
  [4, 0, 4, 0, 4],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 6, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```
- In this scenario, every `0` on the top row is replaced by `4`, while all zeros below the top row (except where other numbers exist) stay the same.

**Example 3**
- **Input**: 
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

- **Output**: 
  ```
  [

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```
- Starting from the top, the first three rows have their `0`s replaced by `4`s. Then, moving down, the fourth row only has its `0`s replaced by `4`s until it hits the first non-zero number (`3`), after which no more `0`s are changed in that row or any subsequent rows.

### Applying the Transformation Rule

The rule seems to work as follows:
- If a row is one of the topmost rows that do not contain any non-zero value, all zeroes in that row are replaced with `4`.
- Once a row contains a non-zero value, all zeroes in that row and subsequent rows remain `0`.

Given the test case:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

- The input consists of a 9x12 grid.
- The first three rows are completely filled with `0`s.
- These top three rows will have all zeroes replaced by `4`s according to the rule.

Thus, the output would be:
- The first three rows will contain `4`s instead of `0`s.
- The forth row onward will not change because they have non-zero values starting from the fourth row.

Therefore, the output is:

aabf363d,"In order to determine the transformation rule that was applied in the training examples, let's analyze them:

1. In Example 1, the number 2 appears in several places within the input grid. The corresponding output grid replaces all instances of the number 2 with 4.

2. Similarly, in Example 2, all instances of the number 3 in the input grid are replaced with 6 in the output grid.

3. Considering the patterns, it seems that the transformation rule involves replacing a specific number in the input grid with another specific number in the output grid. 

4. In both examples, only one type of number (2 and 3 respectively) is replaced, while zeroes and other numbers remain unchanged. The number being replaced appears to be transformed into the next number that follows it sequentially in the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, wrapping around at the end of the sequence.

From these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule is to replace each occurrence of a number n with (n+1) modulo 9 (with 0 remaining unchanged).

Let's apply this rule to the test grid provided.
- We find that 8 is present in the grid. 
- According to our rule, 8 should be replaced with (8+1) % 9 = 0.

Therefore, the number 8 in the grid is replaced with 0, and since 2 is not part of the rule (it does not transform to another non-zero number in the pattern observed), it remains as 2.

Given the test grid:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],

6773b310,"To determine the transformation rule between the input and output grids, let's analyze the examples step-by-step:

In the first training example, the full-sized grid contains a pattern of 8's surrounded by 0's and 6's. The output grid seems to indicate where there are transitions from 0 to 8 (or vice versa) in the original grid. Specifically:

- In the output grid, a ""1"" appears in a cell if an 8 is directly next to a 0 in that position's row of the input grid.

Let's apply this rule to the other examples:

Example 2:
- Row 0: There is no transition from 0 to 8 or 8 to 0, so the first row is all zeros.
- Row 1: The first column has 6 next to 8, the third column has 6 next to 8, and the fifth column has 8 next to 6. Thus, the second row in the output is [0, 0, 1] on the left side but should actually be [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], which simplifies to [0, 0, 1].
- Row 2: There is only one transition (6 to 8), so the output is [1, 0, 0].

Following this logic for the remaining rows:

Example 3:
- Row 0 has transitions at positions 1 and 2.
- Row 1 has a transition at position 2.
- Row 2 has a transition at position 5.

Example 4:
- Row 0 has transitions at positions 2 and 9.
- Row 1 has transitions at positions 1 and 3.
- Row 2 has a transition at position 5.

Now applying this rule to the test case:

Test Case:
- Row 0: Transition from 0 to 8 and back to 6 at positions 3 and 7.
- Row 1: Transition from 6 to 8 at position 1.
- Row 2: Transition from 0 to 8 at position 3.
- Row 3: No transitions.
- Row 4: Transition from 0 to 8 at position 3.
- Row 5: Transition from 0 to 8 at position 1 and from 8 to 6 at position 4.
- Row 6: Transition from 0 to 8 at position 3 and from 8 to 6 at position 6.
- Row 7: No transitions.
- Row 8: Transition from 6 to 8 at position 1.
- Row 9: Transition from 0 to 8 at position 1 and from 6 to 8 at position 10.
- Row 10: Transition from 0 to 8 at position 3.

Thus, the test case should have the following output:
Answer: ```[[0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0]]``` 

Since empty lists aren't expected in the output format, we convert them to zeroes:
Answer: ```[[0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0]]```",,False,False,0.0
44d8ac46,"To find the transformation rule from the input to the output in the given examples, we need to closely analyze the differences between the two:

1. In Example 1, the input has a solid '5' block that gets an internal '2' added diagonally.
2. In Example 2, the input also introduces a '2' inside where there's a gap between '5' blocks vertically.
3. In Example 3, similar to Example 2, the input has a vertical gap between '5' blocks which gets filled with '2'.
4. In Example 4, since there are no gaps to fill internally or diagonally with '2', the output remains the same as the input.

The transformation rule seems to involve filling any gaps in a block of '5's with '2's if there are adjacent '5's on both sides and at least one row in-between horizontally or column-wise vertically.

For the test case, looking at the input we see several blocks that can potentially have gaps filled with '2'. 

Blocks to check:
- The first two rows and last two rows form a continuous block without gaps.
- There are some potential gaps in the middle rows and columns.

Let's fill in the gaps where there are '5's on either side. Specifically:
- The second row has a sequence of '5's followed by a '0' and another sequence of '5's, indicating a potential gap.
- The third row and fourth row have gaps within their sequences of '5's.
- The ninth row has a potential gap to be checked.

After checking each row and column carefully, we find:

- The gaps in the middle of the '5's in rows 3, 4, 5, and 10 should be filled with '2'.

Therefore, the answer for the test case should look like this:

67385a82,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze how the inputs are turned into their respective outputs.

From the provided examples, we can observe that:
- All instances of the integer `3` that do not have another `3` directly adjacent horizontally or vertically (top, bottom, left, right) are replaced with `8`.
- `3`s that are surrounded by other `3`s on any side horizontally or vertically remain unchanged.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

```
Test Case:
[
[3, 0, 3, 0, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
[0, 3, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 3, 3, 0, 0]]
```

We'll go through each '3' in the grid, checking if it has any '3's adjacent to it. If not, it gets replaced with '8'.

1. First row, first column: `3`, no adjacent `3` -> change to `8`.
2. First row, second column: `0`, no action needed.
3. First row, third column: `3`, adjacent to `8` (new value after first check) -> no change.
4. First row, fourth column: `0`, no action needed.
5. First row, fifth column: `3`, no adjacent `3` -> change to `8`.

So far, the first row looks like this:
```
[8, 0, 3, 0, 8]
```

Continuing this process for the rest of the rows based on the rule mentioned:

Second row:
```
[3, 3, 3, 0, 0] -> [3, 3, 3, 0, 0] (no changes since every '3' is surrounded)
```

Third row:
```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 3] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 8] ('3' in the fifth column does not have an adjacent 3 horizontally or vertically)
```

Fourth row:
```
[0, 3, 3, 0, 0] -> [0, 3, 3, 0, 0] (no changes since every '3' is next to another '3')

- Example 2 Input Grid (4x3) -> Output Grid (4x6): Each row in the input grid is repeated once.
- Example 3 Input Grid (4x4) -> Output Grid (4x8): Each row in the input grid is repeated twice.

The transformation rule appears to be multiplying the width of the grid by a factor based on the number of rows. Specifically, when the grid has 3 rows, the width is multiplied by 2. When the grid has 4 rows, the width is multiplied by 2 or 4 according to the examples.

Let's apply this to the test case which has 5 rows. Following these rules, we expect the width to be multiplied by 2.

1b2d62fb,"To figure out the transformation rule from the input to the output, let's analyze the provided training examples:

1. In each of the examples, the output grid contains numbers 0 and 8.
2. The number 8 in the output grid seems to correspond to the presence of the sequence ""9, 1"" in the input grid horizontally or vertically.
3. If there is no such sequence in a row or column, that entire row or column is filled with 0s in the output.

Examining more closely, we can see the rule applied:

- Example 1: The sequence ""9, 1"" appears in the 4th row (from left to right) of the input grid. Only the 4th row in the output grid has any non-zero value, which is 8 where ""9, 1"" was present.
- Example 2: The sequence ""9, 1"" appears in the 1st row (from left to right).
- Example 3: The sequence ""9, 1"" appears in the 1st and 3rd rows (from left to right), and also in the 1st column (from top to bottom). Hence, the 1st and 3rd rows get 8s in positions where ""9, 1"" was present, and the 1st column gets 8s at positions where ""9, 1"" was present.
- Example 4: The sequence ""9, 1"" appears in the 2nd, 4th, and 5th rows. Therefore, the 2nd, 4th, and 5th rows have 8s only where ""9, 1"" was present.
- Example 5: The sequence ""9, 1"" appears in the 4th column (from top to bottom), so the 4th column has 8s in positions where ""9, 1"" was present.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case. We look for occurrences of the sequence ""9, 1"" in the input grid.

The sequence ""9, 1"" appears in the 2nd row (from left to right) and the 4th column (from top to bottom).

Therefore, the 2nd row of the output grid will have 8s only where ""9, 1"" was present, and the 4th column of the output grid will also have 8s only where ""9, 1"" was present.

Applying this rule to the test case:

[6, 8, 3],
[8, 7, 8],
[5, 5, 2]]
```

Same pattern applies here as well.

With these observations, it seems the rule is:
- Replace every `5` with an `8`.
- Replace every `8` that is touching a `5` horizontally or vertically on the grid with a `5`.

Let’s apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[8, 8, 4, 5],
[3, 8, 7, 5],
[3, 7, 1, 9],
[6, 4, 8, 8]]
```

Processing each row and column:
- In the first row, the `5` will be replaced with an `8` and the `8`s on either side of it will be replaced with `5`s.
- In the second row, both `5`s will be replaced with `8`s and the `8`s around them will be replaced with `5`s.
- The third row doesn't have any `5` so no changes are made.
- In the fourth row, the last two `8`s are not touching any `5` so they stay `8`s, but the `8` before those ones is touching the `5` in the previous row, so it should be replaced with `5`.

Applying the rule:
```
[
[8, 5, 4, 8], # First row: 5->8, 8s next to 5 -> 5
[3, 5, 7, 8],  # Second row: 5->8, 8 next to 5 -> 5
[3, 7, 1, 9],  # Third row: no change (no 5)
[5, 4, 8, 8]]  # Fourth row: 8 next to 5 in above row -> 5, no other change
```

So following the transformation rule, the solution for the test case is:
Answer: ```[[8, 5, 4, 8], [3, 5, 7, 8], [3, 7, 1, 9], [5, 4, 8, 8]]```","[[8 5 4 8]

09629e4f,"To deduce the transformation rule from the examples provided, let's carefully analyze each pair:

In the first example, the pattern seems to transform all non-zero numbers to the number that appears most frequently in the corresponding column. This happens unless the number in the middle row (index 4) is the same as the central column (index 4), which is unchanged.

Example 1: Observing the columns,
- Column 0: Numbers [2, 0, 6] become 2.
- Column 1: Numbers [0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0] become 0.
- Column 2: Numbers [0, 3, 0, 5, 8, 4, 2, 5, 8, 4, 2] become 0.
- Column 3: Numbers [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] remain 5.
- Column 4: Numbers [0, 4, 3, 5, 6, 0, 3, 5, 0, 4, 6] remain 0.
- Columns 5 through 7 follow a similar pattern to Column 3.
- Columns 8 through 10: Numbers [0, 3, 8, 5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0] become 0 or 6 based on the occurrence.

Similarly, in other examples, we can see that every number except the central ones, if they differ, gets replaced by the most frequent number in its column.

Applying this rule to the test case:

For each column:
- Determine the most frequent number.
- Replace every other number in the column with this number, keeping the central row's numbers unchanged if they match this frequency.

Test Case Analysis:

Column 0: Numbers [6, 0, 2, 5, 2, 3, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0] -- Most frequent is 0.
Column 1: Numbers [4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 8, 5, 2, 0, 0] -- Most frequent is 0.
Column 2: Numbers [0, 3, 8, 5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 4, 3, 0] -- Most frequent is 0.
Column 3: All are 5 -- No change.
Column 4: Numbers [0, 2, 4, 5, 0, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 2] -- Most frequent is 0.
Column 5: Numbers [3, 0, 0, 5, 3, 4, 0, 5, 6, 0, 0] -- Most frequent is 0.
Column 6: Numbers [0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3, 8] -- Most frequent is 0.
Column 7: All are 5 -- No change.
Column 8: Numbers [0, 8, 6, 5, 3, 0, 8, 5, 0, 4, 0] -- Most frequent is 0.
Column 9: Numbers [4, 0, 3, 5, 6, 0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0] -- Most frequent is 0.
Column 10: Numbers [0, 2, 0, 5, 2, 4, 0, 5, 8, 6, 0] -- Most frequent is 0.

Therefore, the output should replace all non-central column 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 numbers with 0 and keep column 3, 7, 11 numbers as is.

539a4f51,"To identify the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes in each training example:

In all three examples, we see that the width of each row is doubled, and new colors are added to the right side of each row based on a pattern. We also notice that new rows are added below the original ones, which are filled with additional patterns.

Upon closer inspection, the new rows being added follow a repeating pattern of the first four elements in every row (excluding trailing zeros) but with an additional color at the end of the new row. This additional color comes from the original pattern and appears to follow the next color in sequence from the original pattern, cycling back to the start when necessary.

For the test case, we apply the same logic:

Original Pattern: `[7, 7, 3, 2, 2]` (ignoring trailing zeros).
The repeated pattern should be followed by the next color in the sequence.
Next color in sequence after `2` is `7`, and so we append `7` to the repeated pattern.

Now, let's build the output grid for the test case following the identified pattern:

```
[
[7, 7, 3, 2, 2, 7, 7, 3, 2, 2],  # Original + repeat + next color
[7, 7, 3, 2, 2, 7, 7, 3, 2, 2],
[3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 7, 7, 3, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 7, 3, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 7, 3, 2, 2]
```

Then, add more rows with the next colors in sequence appended to them:
```
[7, 7, 3, 2, 2, 7, 7, 3, 2, 7], 
[7, 7, 3, 2, 2, 7, 7, 3, 7, 7],
[7, 7, 3, 2, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],
[7, 7, 3, 2, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],
[7, 7, 3, 2, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]

810b9b61,"To find the transformation rule from the given training examples, let's analyze the differences between the inputs and outputs:

In the Example 1, we see that wherever there are contiguous blocks of `1`s within the grid, those blocks are replaced with `3`s in the output, while all other cells remain `0` unless they are already `3` or not part of the block of `1`s.

Example 2 and Example 3 follow the same rule. In Example 2, there's a small isolated cluster of `1`s that gets transformed into `3`s, whereas in Example 3, an entire row of `1`s remains unchanged except for the isolated `1`s which get turned into `3`s.

Hence, the rule seems to be transforming contiguous regions or clusters of `1`s into `3`s, while leaving the remaining cells as `0`s if they were originally `0`s in the input grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input

In Example 1, the input grid is:

```
[1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2]
[1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1]

And the output grid is:

```
[1, 1, 3, 2]
[1, 1, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 1, 1]
[2, 3, 1, 1]
```

It appears that every other column starting from the first is removed, making the grid narrower by half its original width.

In Example 2, the input grid is:

```
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[6, 4, 8, 6, 4, 8]
[6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 8]
```

And the output grid is:

```
[4, 4, 4]
[6, 4, 8]
[6, 6, 8]

Again, we see that every other column starting from the first is removed.

In Example 3, the input grid is:

```
[2, 3]
[3, 2]
[4, 4]
[2, 3]
[3, 2]
[4, 4]
[6, 6]
[2, 6]
```

And the output grid is:

```
[2, 3]
[3, 2]
[4, 4]
```

The pattern continues; every other row starting from the first is removed, resulting in a grid that is half the height of the original one.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule appears to involve keeping only every other element in either rows or columns of the grid starting from the first one. Specifically, the operation alternates between removing every other column and every other row depending on the sequence of transformations.

For the test case:

Input:
```
[5, 4, 5]

[2, 6, 2]
[5, 4, 5]

[6, 6, 4]

Since the previous examples alternated between column removal and row removal, and there have been two column removals so far, we should expect a row removal next.

Therefore, the output grid should consist of every other row starting from the first:

Observing the examples:
- Example 1: In the input grid there are only 2s, and in the output, there's a single 2.
- Example 2: In the input grid there are only 8s, and in the output, there's a single 8.
- Example 3: In the input grid there are a mix of 1s and 2s, but in the output, there's a single 1 (the most frequent non-zero number).
- Example 4: In the input grid there are a mix of 3s and 8s, but in the output, there's a single 8 (the most frequent non-zero number).

The transformation rule seems to be:

1. Identify all non-zero numbers in the grid.
2. Count the occurrences of each non-zero number.
3. Select the number that appears the most times (if more than one number has the maximum count, it is ambiguous based on the provided data, but we can assume that only one number would be selected or it doesn't matter which one is chosen among the most frequent).
4. Create an output grid with a single cell containing the most frequently occurring non-zero number.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- Non-zero numbers in the test case are 1, 4.
- Counting the occurrences:
  - 1 appears 7 times.
  - 4 appears 5 times.
- Therefore, the most frequent non-zero number is 1.

d90796e8,"To figure out the transformation rule between the inputs and outputs, let's compare the numbers in the corresponding positions:

- In Example 1, the number 3 became 8, and the number 2 also became 8.
- In Example 2, the number 3 became 8, and the number 2 became 8 again.
- In Example 3, the number 3 became 8 when it was surrounded by zeros horizontally or vertically, and the number 2 remained 2.

Given these observations, we can deduce that:
- All occurrences of the number 3 in the input grid are replaced with the number 8 in the output grid.
- All occurrences of the number 2 not surrounded by any other non-zero numbers remain 2; if surrounded by any other non-zero number, they are replaced with 8.

Now let's apply this rule to the test case.

Applying the rule described above:
- Replace every 3 with 8.
- Replace each 2 with 8 if it is surrounded by any non-zero number(s) (horizontally or vertically), otherwise keep it as 2.

Test Case Calculation:
- First row: No 3s, only one 2 which is not surrounded by other non-zero numbers.
- Second row: A 3 and two 2s, where one of the 2s is surrounded by a 3.
- Third row: Only one 3.
- Fourth row: One 2 which is not surrounded by other non-zero numbers.
- Fifth row: Two 2s, both of them are surrounded by a 5.
- Sixth row: One 3.
- Seventh row: A 3 and a 2 surrounded by a 5.

Firstly, observe that in the output grids, there are new numbers (1, 2, 3) introduced around some of the existing numbers (0, 5), particularly in areas where the 5 forms a solid vertical or horizontal line. Specifically, these new numbers appear in positions where the original number was 0, but they are surrounded by 5s on either side (horizontally or vertically).

Let's apply this observation to each example:

**Example 1:**
- At the top, the zeros next to the 5s are converted to 1s.
- In the middle block of 5s, zeros adjacent to the 5s remain unchanged.
- Towards the bottom, zeros next to 5s on the rightmost part are converted to 3s.

**Example 2:**
- Zeros next to the left-most set of 5s (forming a vertical line) are converted to 1s.
- The central set of 5s has no changes in the surrounding zeros.
- Zeros next to the right-most set of 5s (forming a vertical line) are converted to 3s.
- Zeros within a horizontal line of 5s get converted to 2s.

**Example 3:**
- Zeros next to the left-most set of 5s (forming a vertical line) are converted to 1s.
- Zeros next to the central set of 5s (creating a pattern of vertical and horizontal lines) are converted to 2s.
- Zeros next to the right-most set of 5s (forming a vertical line) are converted to 3s.

From these patterns, we can infer the following rules:
1. If a zero is next to a vertical line of 5s (left or right), it should be assigned the number 1 at the beginning of the vertical line and 3 at the end.
2. If a zero is next to a horizontal line of 5s (above or below), it should be assigned the number 2.

Applying these rules to the test case:

- The zeros in the first row, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, ninth, and tenth columns, which are next to vertical lines of 5s, get converted to 1s at the beginning of the vertical lines and 3s at the end.

- Zeros in the fourth, sixth, eighth, and ninth rows, which have 5s above and below, get converted to 2s.

a79310a0,"To figure out the transformation rule that turns the inputs into the corresponding outputs, let's analyze the changes step by step:

- In Example 1, the top two rows with color `8` have been shifted down by one row, and all the previous cells in those rows have been replaced with `0`.
- In Example 2, the column with color `8` has been moved to the next row down, and the original cell has been set to `0`. It's observed that there was only one occurrence of `8`, so it might indicate that if there's more than one consecutive `8` in a column, they all move down.
- Example 3 seems to follow the same logic as Example 2, where the consecutive `8`s in a single row shift down collectively.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that any group of consecutive identical numbers (in this case, `8`) in a column shifts down by one row, while cells above them become `0`. If there are multiple such groups in a column, each group shifts independently.

Applying this rule to the Test case:
- There are three consecutive `8`s in the second column. Each `8` will shift down one row from its current position, and each cell directly above an `8` will become `0`.

The Test case should therefore be transformed into:

ce9e57f2,"To find the transformation rule from the inputs to the outputs, let's analyze the given examples.

In Example 1, the initial column with 2s in it starts transforming into 8s starting at row index 4. For every two rows down from this point, it extends the transformation of 2s into 8s one column further to the right.

In Example 2, there are two columns with 2s in them initially; columns 1 and 8. The transformation happens similarly - starting at row 4, and extending to new columns every two rows, but only up to where the original pattern of 2s ends.

In Example 3, we see that the transformation begins at row 5 due to the presence of a 2 closer to the bottom. The pattern starts changing at row 5 and extends two rows down and one column further right each time, ending at the last column containing a 2.

From these observations, the rule appears to be:

- Whenever a 2 is present in the input, starting from the lowest occurrence of 2 in the first column, change every second row below that occurrence into 8s.
- Extend the transformation one column to the right for every two rows down.
- Only transform columns that have a 2 in their top half until the transformation reaches a column without a 2 in its top half.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:
The lowest occurrence of a 2 in the first column is on row 7. Starting from there, every two rows after that should be transformed into an 8 in the corresponding column. If a new column has a 2 in the top half, the transformation will continue to that column.

Let's apply the rule:
- From row 7 onwards, column 1 changes (7, 9) -> 8.
- Next transformation begins at row 9 for column 2 -> (9, 11) -> 8.
- Next transformation continues at row 11 for column 3 -> (11, 1) (out of bounds) for column 4.
- No more transformations happen since row 11 is out of bounds for the grid size.

Thus, based on the rules described above, the grid at the test case should be transformed as follows:

eb281b96,"To figure out the transformation rule, let's analyze the structure of both the input and output grids in the provided examples.

In Example 1, the input grid is repeated twice vertically to form the output grid.
In Example 2, the input grid is repeated three times vertically to form the output grid.

From these examples, we can infer that the transformation rule involves duplicating the rows of the input grid in the output grid. Specifically, the number of repetitions seems to be dependent on the number of unique patterns of rows within the input grid.

The test case has 5 unique rows (with different numbers of repetition patterns), so we should repeat those 5 rows twice (or add their copies) to get the transformation.

Input grid:

d6ad076f,"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the transformation rules applied to each training example.

Example 1:
- There was a solid block of color 2 occupying the middle of rows 2, 3, and 4.
- In the output, there's an additional pattern in row 5 with 8s filling the columns where the 2s were present in the previous rows. The rest of the grid remains as in the input.

Example 2:
- Similarly, there was a block of 4s centered in rows 2 to 4, and a block of 6s in row 7.
- In the output, there's an additional pattern in row 5 with 8s filling the columns where the 4s were. Additionally, in rows 7 and below, the columns where the 6s were start having 8s from row 6 downwards. The rest of the grid remains as in the input.

Example 3:
- There was a block of 3s centered at the top three rows, and a block of 9s centered at the bottom two rows.
- The output added an 8 pattern in the columns where the 3s were present from rows 4 to 9, covering the space left by the 3s. For the 9s, the output added an 8 pattern in rows 4 to 6, just above the original 9s.

From these examples, we can deduce that the transformation rule applies as follows:
- If there is a column filled with a non-zero color in consecutive rows, then the column directly below those rows up to the next zero row boundary (or the end of the grid), gets filled with the number 8.

Applying this rule to the test case:

The input shows a solid block of 1s from rows 1 to 7 in columns 1 to 4. The 2s start from row 2 and fill out columns 8 to 10 until row 7. According to the rule derived from the examples, we should add an 8 in the next rows under where these blocks exist until we hit the next zero row, which in this case would be row 8 for both blocks.

Test Case Transformation:
- Row 8 onwards for columns 1 to 4 should be filled with 8s.
- Row 8 onwards for columns 8 to 10 should also be filled with 8s.

- In Example 3, the '1' in the input grid moves three positions left in each subsequent row but also alternates its placement within the row.

From these patterns, we can infer that the rule involves shifting the '1' left by an amount equal to the width of the grid minus one, and alternating its placement after every few rows based on the width of the grid.

Applying this to the test case where the width is 5, the '1' should move four positions left in each subsequent row, cycling back to the end after reaching the first column.

b0c4d837,"To determine the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's break down what happens in each one:

1. In Example 1, we start with a vertical column of 5s surrounded by 0s and an 8 at the bottom center. The output shows only the bottommost 8 and its adjacent cells.
2. Example 2 follows a similar pattern but with a wider middle section of 8s, and the output places the 8s in the first row.
3. Example 3 has a single vertical column of 5s with an 8 at the bottom center. The output shows only the bottommost 8.
4. Example 4 also has a single vertical column of 5s with an 8 at the bottom center, but here the 8s are more spread out horizontally. The output places the bottommost and rightmost 8s accordingly.
5. In Example 5, there is a shorter column of 5s with an 8 at the third row, and the output reflects only that single 8.
6. Lastly, Example 6 looks similar to Example 4, where 8s are placed in a pattern. The output reflects only the presence of 8s at the bottom of the column and the middle horizontal span.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is as follows:
- If the number 8 exists in the input, it is transformed into a 3x3 grid in the output. 
- The position of 8 within the original grid determines the placement of the 8s in the output grid.
- The output grid is always of size 3x3, and if no 8 is present, the output grid consists of all zeros.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

The test case consists of a vertical column with a 5 in the middle and several 8s below it. Based on the rules observed, the 8 that is closest to the bottom of the column will be reflected in the output.

Therefore, the answer would be a 3x3 grid with 8s starting from the middle of the top row downwards, based on their positions in the original grid.

4c4377d9,"To understand the transformation rule applied in these examples, let's break down the process:

1. For each example, we observe that the output grid is exactly twice the height of the input grid.
2. The top half of the output grid mirrors the original input grid vertically (reversing the order of rows).
3. The bottom half of the output grid appears to be the original input grid repeated in the same vertical order.

In simpler terms, the rule seems to create an output where the input is flipped upside-down, followed by the same input again.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[[4, 4, 9, 9],
 [4, 4, 4, 4],
 [4, 4, 9, 9]]
```

Step-by-step Transformation:
- Mirror the input vertically to get the first three rows of the output.
- Repeat the input below those rows to get the last three rows of the output.

The mirrored input becomes:
```
[[4, 4, 9, 9],
 [4, 4, 4, 4],
 [4, 4, 9, 9]]
```

Repeating the input below this mirrored version results in:
```
[[4, 4, 9, 9],
 [4, 4, 4, 4],
 [4, 4, 9, 9],
 [4, 4, 9, 9],
 [4, 4, 4, 4],
 [4, 4, 9, 9]]
```

Thus, the output for the test case should look like this:
Answer: ```[[4, 4, 9, 9], [4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 9, 9], [4, 4, 9, 9], [4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 9, 9]]```","[[4 4 9 9]

447fd412,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input to get the output, let's analyze the pattern in the provided examples.

In Example 1, we can observe that the output grid has additional ""1"" and ""2""s spread around where they originally were, creating a wider spread of color. Particularly, the color ""2"" spreads out more than ""1"".

In Example 2, we can also see that the ""2""s and ""1""s expand, but with more complex interactions around the edges. This time, the ""1""s extend out more, filling the spaces below the initial row of ""1""s and spreading out to fill gaps near ""2""s.

In Example 3, the same kind of expansion occurs, with an even more complex interaction, especially noticeable in the middle column where the ""1""s and ""2""s meet. Here, ""1""s and ""2""s spread out and interact, with ""1""s filling the space below and ""2""s surrounding them.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves expanding the presence of each non-zero number vertically and horizontally, while maintaining the shape. When two different numbers interact, the numbers usually fill the gaps between them, but sometimes the expansion is not symmetric or uniform, favoring one type over the other based on their density or initial position in the grid.

For the Test Case, we need to apply the same rule:

Based on our analysis, we expand the presence of non-zero numbers outward. ""1""s and ""2""s should spread outwards from their initial positions.

### Example 1:
**Input:**

[
[1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 2, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

- We see that all `1`s in the first row have been incremented by `1` to become `2`, except when they are followed directly by another `1` or at the end of the row. The second `1` remains unchanged.
- The third and fourth rows have a similar pattern where the first `1` is incremented by `1` but any following `1`s remain unchanged.

- In this example, starting from the leftmost `1`, we see that the `1`s in the first and fifth rows are incremented by `1` until a `0` is encountered or the end of the row is reached. Then the next `1` starts a new sequence of incrementations.

- Here, the `1`s in the second and third rows are both incremented by `1` up until the next `0`. When a `0` is encountered, the next `1` starts a new sequence of incrementations.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- For each row, starting from the leftmost `1` in the row, every subsequent `1` gets incremented by `1`, until a `0` is encountered, after which the next `1` starts again from `1`.

### Test Case Solution:
**Input:**
```
[
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

- Applying the rule, the first row starts with `1`, and it is incremented by `1` until the next `0` is seen or the end of the row is met.
- The second row has no `1`s, so it remains unchanged.
- The third row starts incrementing its `1`s from `1`.
- Rows without `1`s are unchanged.

Therefore, the solution would be as follows:

0ca9ddb6,"To figure out the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. In each example, we observe that cells adjacent to non-zero (color) cells get modified.
2. Each non-zero cell appears to have a '4' and/or '7' inserted in cells immediately surrounding it. 
3. Specifically, '4' seems to be placed directly above and below the cell, while '7' seems to be placed directly to the left and right.

Let's apply this rule to the Test Case:

Input:

```

Following the identified pattern where '4' is inserted above and below, and '7' is inserted to the left and right of each non-zero cell:

- For the cell with value '1', place '4' in the cell above and below it, and '7' on its left and right.
- For the cell with value '2', place '4' in the cell above and below it, and '7' on its left and right.
- Place '4' above and below the value '8', and '7' to the left and right of the value '8'.
- Do the same for the other '2' and the '6'.

7447852a,"To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

**Observations:**

1. In each row of the grid, where there is a sequence of two consecutive `2`s in the input, there appears a single `4` in the output.
2. The number `4` seems to be the sum of two neighboring `2`s.
3. There are no changes made to any other numbers.

Given these observations, I conclude that the transformation rule is as follows: 
- If two adjacent cells in a row contain the integer `2`, they are replaced by a single cell with the integer `4`.
- This rule is applied from left to right, across each row independently.

Let's apply this rule to the Test Case.

Test Case:
[
[2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2],
[0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]]

Applying the rule:
- For the first row, every pair of adjacent `2`s will be replaced by a `4`, leading to a new grid: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2]`
- For the second row, every pair of adjacent `2`s will be replaced by a `4`, leading to a new grid: `[4, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 4, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 4, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 4, 2, 0, 2]`.
- For the third row, every pair of adjacent `2`s would remain `2`, since there is no adjacent pair. Therefore, it remains unchanged: `[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]`.

Putting all the rows together, we have:

Answer: ```[[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2], [4, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 4, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 4, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 4, 2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]]```",,False,False,0.0
53b68214,"To figure out the transformation rule applied in each of the examples, let's analyze what changes occur from the input to the output:

- In Example 1, the input grid was extended vertically (added rows) with columns that contain the same color patterns as those present in the input grid, starting from the base of the non-zero value clusters.
- In Example 2, the input grid was filled out to a complete 10x10 grid by copying the pattern and repeating the last row until the grid size is completed.
- In Example 3, similarly to Example 2, the input grid was extended to a 10x10 grid by copying the initial pattern and appending the last row repeatedly.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves extending the input grid to a fixed size (in this case, 10 rows) by appending copies of the last row until the grid reaches that size.

Applying this rule to the Test case:
The Test case input grid has 8 rows, so we need to add 2 more rows at the bottom to make it 10 rows total. We should copy the last row (which contains the pattern [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) twice to extend the grid.

Therefore, the solution for the test case will be:

28e73c20,"Upon examining the provided examples, I noticed that the transformation rule involves setting the border cells and certain interior cells to the color 3 while keeping other cells as 0. For each example, the top and bottom rows, along with the leftmost and rightmost columns, are set to 3. Additionally, within the grid, there's a pattern emerging where cells in specific positions are also assigned the value 3.

In order to discern this pattern, let's closely look at the placement of 3s in the middle section of each grid:

- Example 1: There are no interior cells with 3.
- Example 2: Interior cells are set to 3 in a staggered pattern starting from the second row, moving down two rows each time, and alternating between the first and second column on each row.
- Example 3: Similar to Example 2, but the alternating pattern starts one column further to the right in each subsequent row.
- Example 4: Similar to Example 2, but starts alternating from the third column instead.
- Example 5: Starts the alternating pattern from the fifth column.

It appears that the interior 3s follow a zig-zag pattern, where they start from slightly different columns depending on the size of the grid and move down two rows each time while advancing one column to the right every alternate row.

For the test case, we have a grid of size 18x18. Based on the pattern observed, we can infer that the 3s will start from the 1st column (same as Example 1) and proceed in a similar manner.

Using this rule for the given test case:
The top and bottom rows are filled with 3s and the rest of the border cells.
Then, we place 3s in the interior following the pattern observed in larger grids.

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```

The `2`s at the bottom rows spread upwards through direct connections to `1`s, changing them to `2`s while maintaining the gaps created by `0`s.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
Let's apply this rule to the provided test case:

#### Input:
```
[
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0]
]
```

- First, identify the `2`s and their positions.
- Start from these positions and move upwards, turning `1`s into `2`s if they are directly above a `2` or are connected through the existing `1`s without interruption by `0`s.

#### Applying the spread upward:
- From the third row, second-to-last column, `2` spreads to the second row, second-to-last column. 
- It continues to spread to the first row, second-to-last column.
- From the fifth row, fourth column and sixth column, `2`s spread upward to the adjacent `1`s in the fourth row.

So the transformed grid would be:
```
[
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1],

[0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0]

5521c0d9,"To determine the transformation rule used in these examples, let's analyze the changes from the inputs to the outputs:

1. In Example 1, the color ""1"" in the 12th row spreads up to include rows 8 through 11, and the color ""2"" in the 13th and 14th rows moves down to position 11 and below.
2. In Example 2, the color ""4"" in rows 10 through 14 moves up to occupy the 4th through 7th rows, and the color ""2"" shifts to rows 9 and below. Similarly, the color ""1"" moves down from row 14 to the bottom rows.
3. In Example 3, the color ""1"" in the 12th row moves up to include up to the 7th row, while the color ""4"" in the 13th and 14th rows moves down to occupy rows 10 and below. The color ""2"" remains in the 14th row but appears in a new column.

From these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves moving non-zero values upwards and downwards based on their initial positions, filling the grid cells above with the uppermost value that was moved up, and the cells below with the lowest moved value. Essentially, colors in the input grid move up or down until they fill the top or bottom parts of the grid respectively.

Applying the same rule to the Test case:

- The color ""2"" in the 9th row should move upwards to fill all the rows above it (up to the first non-zero row).
- The color ""4"" in the 10th and 11th rows should move down to fill all rows below it (down to the last non-zero row).
- The color ""1"" in the 14th row should also move down, but only starting from its appearance.

Let us apply the rule to the test case:

- The color ""2"" moves up to rows 8, 7, 6, and 5.
- The color ""4"" moves down to rows 13, 12, and 11.
- The color ""1"" moves down to rows 15, 14, and 13.

The resulting grid would look like this:

### Example 1 Analysis:
- From input to output, all occurrences of `7` have been replaced with `5`.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- Similarly, again all occurrences of `7` have been replaced with `5` while other numbers remain unchanged.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- In this example, all instances of `7` are also replaced with `5`, while other numbers stay the same.

Therefore, the transformation rule seems to be replacing all `7`s in the grid with `5`s and keeping the rest of the numbers as they are.

508bd3b6,"To figure out the transformation rule applied to these grid puzzles, I'll analyze each example.

In Example 1, there's a column of 8s on the left side that is transformed into a pattern moving diagonally up to the right. It seems like each 8 is replaced by a 3, and this 3 moves one cell up and one cell to the right with each occurrence of an 8, starting from the bottom left corner of the column.

In Example 2, we see a similar pattern with 8s placed in different positions, but the rule remains the same - the 8 is replaced by a 3 and this new value 3 moves diagonally up to the right relative to its position in the input.

In Example 3, the 8s appear in different places again, and the same rule applies - the 8 is replaced by a 3 and this new value 3 moves one cell up and one cell to the right relative to its position.

Following these examples, we can infer that the transformation rule is to replace any occurrence of the number 8 with 3, and then move this 3 one cell up and one cell to the right until it hits the boundary of the grid, at which point it stops being propagated further.

With this rule in mind, let's apply it to the Test case:

The input grid has 8 appearing in two positions: 
1. At row 1, column 4
2. At row 2, column 5

Applying the rule:
- For the first 8, it gets replaced by a 3 and then propagates up and to the right, stopping at the edge of the grid.
- For the second 8, it also gets replaced by a 3 and moves up and to the right, similarly stopping at the boundary.

Thus, the resulting output grid would look like this after applying the rule:

1e0a9b12,"To find the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the outputs, let's analyze the provided examples.

In Example 1:
- The input grid has non-zero numbers in specific positions.
- The output grid seems to have moved the non-zero numbers from their original places to a new place in the grid, which appears to be towards the top-left corner while maintaining their relative order.

In Example 2:
- Again, non-zero numbers seem to be moved towards the top-left corner, preserving their order.

In Example 3:
- The numbers move similarly, with the first row's non-zero elements moving above the second row's non-zero elements, etc., still with priority towards the top-left corner.

Based on these observations, it seems that the rule is:
- For every non-zero number in the input grid, we place it in its original position but also copy it into the top-left most cell that doesn't yet contain a number smaller than itself. 

For the Test Case:

[0, 0, 6, 0, 0],

- Continue down and right, placing each non-zero number both in its original position and in the next available top-left free spot based on the order.

54d9e175,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes in the examples provided:

1. First, observe that all the 0's in the input are replaced with a number greater than 5 in the output.
2. Look at the numbers around the 5s in the input grid. Each group of numbers surrounding a 5 gets its own unique transformation pattern where the numbers change but the 5 stays the same.

Let's define the unique transformations for the groups around 5:
- Any block of 3 0's surrounding a 5 on one side (either left or right) gets transformed into 3 new numbers. For instance, in Example 1, the first three zeros before the number 5 become 6, and the last three zeros after the 5 also become 6.
- If there are two different sets of numbers around a 5 in the same row, they get distinct transformations. Example 2 shows that the sequence [0, 2, 0] becomes [7, 7, 7] while [0, 3, 0] becomes [8, 8, 8].
- The transformation seems to increment from the leftmost group of three to the rightmost group, using 6, 7, 8, and 9 sequentially.

Applying these observations to the test case:
- First row: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0] - This transforms into [7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9] (based on the second row which contains [0, 2, 0] and [0, 3, 0]).
- Second row: [0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0] - This implies the transformation of the two previous zeros (in the first row) as well as the next ones: [7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9].
- Third row: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0] - Based on the second row, it transforms into [7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9].
- Fourth row: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] - All 5's remain unchanged: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5].
- Fifth row: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0] - The fifth row follows the same logic as the fourth but is influenced by the sixth row, so it starts the transformation pattern again: [7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9].
- Sixth row: [0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0] - This row starts with [0, 1, 0], which would be [6, 6, 6]; followed by another [0, 1, 0] and [0, 3, 0]. Thus, it transforms into [6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 9, 9, 9].
- Seventh row: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0] - Following the sixth row's influence: [6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 9, 9, 9].

f15e1fac,"To solve this puzzle, I'll analyze the transformation rules applied in each of the provided examples.

In Example 1, we see that all non-zero patterns get repeated vertically downward until they reach the bottom of the grid, while maintaining their positions horizontally. Non-zero cells spread downwards from their original row to fill the subsequent rows accordingly.

Example 2 shows similar behavior where the non-zero patterns are also repeated vertically downwards, but there's an additional feature: the pattern starts to 'grow' or expand rightwards one cell at a time as it goes down, stopping when it hits the edge of the grid or another non-zero value.

In Example 3, the pattern starts to grow both rightwards and leftwards from the initial position, spreading the non-zero values (8) across until they meet in the middle, forming a symmetric pattern. The number '2' doesn't seem to follow this expansion rule but rather spreads horizontally in two directions from its starting point.

Based on these observations, the general rule seems to be that non-zero cells are replicated downwards, and for certain cells (like 8 in Example 3), they might also replicate horizontally if they have space. Additionally, specific numbers (such as 2) may behave differently and spread horizontally as well.

Given the Test case, we start from the top and see the first non-zero value (8) located at row 2, column 16. We will replicate and grow this pattern vertically and horizontally as described. The '2's will also spread horizontally. 

Let's apply these rules:

- The first '8' will expand both horizontally and vertically.

3eda0437,"Let's analyze the pattern in the provided examples.

In Example 1, there is a block of zeros at the end of the second row and the beginning of the third row, which are replaced with sixes.

In Example 2, there is a vertical strip of zeros that extends from the bottom to the top, which is also replaced with sixes.

In Example 3, the final column is a series of zeros except for one 1 at the top, which is transformed into sixes.

In Example 4, the pattern continues by transforming the final column into sixes, except for the cells where there's already a value other than zero.

The common transformation rule seems to be replacing the continuous sequences of zeros at the end of columns with sixes, without affecting any non-zero cells in those columns. So, we apply this rule to the test case:

For the test case, the last three columns starting from the bottom row contain zeros, these zeros should be transformed into sixes.

fafffa47,"To solve the problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grids into the output grids. Let's analyze the examples provided:

- In Example 1, we see that any '9' surrounded on all sides by '0's is transformed into a '0', while isolated '0's (not surrounded by '9's) remain '0'. However, if a '0' has a '9' neighbor above or to the left (considering the top-left corner of the output grid), it becomes a '2'.

- In Example 2, a similar rule applies. Any '9' that isn't adjacent to another '9' is transformed into '0', and '0's surrounded by '9's on the left and above become '2's.

- Example 3 follows the same principle. '9's in isolation or not adjacent to other '9's stay '0', whereas '0's surrounded by '9's on the left and/or above become '2'.

- Example 4 also shows the application of the identified rule: '9's surrounded by '0's on both sides horizontally or vertically are transformed into '0', and '0's surrounded by '9's on the left and/or above become '2'.

- Lastly, in Example 5, the rule continues consistently. Isolated '9's become '0', and '0's surrounded by '9's on the left and/or above become '2'.

Therefore, the rule seems to be: 
1. For every '0' in the input grid, if it has at least one '9' directly above it (in the row above) or to its left (in the column to the left), it changes to '2'.
2. All other '0's and '9's remain unchanged.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Input Grid:
```
[[9, 0, 9],
 [0, 0, 9],
 [9, 0, 9],
 [0, 1, 1],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 0]]
```

Analyzing row by row:

- First row: None of the '0's have a '9' above them, so they stay '0'.
- Second row: The first '0' has a '9' above it, so it changes to '2'. The second '0' stays '0' because no '9' is directly above it.
- Third row: The first '0' has a '9' above it, so it changes to '2'. The second '0' stays '0'.
- Fourth and fifth rows: No '0's have a '9' above them, so they stay '0'.
- Sixth row: The second '0' has a '9' above it, so it changes to '2'; the first '0' does not.

Thus, the resulting output grid should look like:

a65b410d,"To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

From the first example:
- We can see that a column with a non-zero value at a certain row gets all rows above that row filled with a descending pattern starting one less than the non-zero value found.
- When the non-zero value is `2`, the cells directly above it get `3` and the cells above those get `0`.

From the second example:
- A longer stretch of non-zero values (`2, 2, 2`) results in a similarly adjusted pattern, but now the pattern extends higher since there are more non-zero values in the original input.

From the third example:
- For `2, 2, 2, 2, 2`, the same rule applies - we start filling up with one less than the initial non-zero value and then continue to fill up with decreasing numbers until we run out of space or decrease to `0`.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:
- Start from the bottom of each column.
- If a non-zero value is found at position `i`, every cell from `i-1` up to the top of the grid should be assigned a color one lower than the initial non-zero value, and once the value hits `0`, it stays `0`.

Applying this rule to the test case:
```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

The non-zero value `2` appears in the third row and all columns from 0 to 4. Therefore:
- In column 0: `2` in row 2 => row 1 gets `3`, row 0 stays `0`.
- In columns 1 through 4: `2` in row 2 => row 1 gets `3`, row 0 gets `4`.
- Columns 5 through 8 remain unchanged as they have no non-zero values below them.

Thus, the resulting transformed grid would be:

5117e062,"To solve the test case, let's first understand the transformation rule applied to the previous examples.

1. In Example 1, the pattern of 3s and 4s in the input grid was transformed into a pattern of 4s in the output.
2. In Example 2, the pattern of 2s and 3s was transformed into a pattern where the central 2 became a 3, and its adjacent 2s remained as 3s.
3. In Example 3, the pattern of 1s and 7s was transformed into a pattern of 2s, with the central 1 becoming the top row and the adjacent 1 transforming to the middle row.

It appears that the transformation involves identifying specific patterns of numbers and converting them into a specific smaller pattern. However, these outputs are not simply repeating the exact numbers but are transforming the central number and possibly its surrounding numbers into a new configuration.

A closer inspection shows that:

- In Example 1, the central number in the pattern of 3s and 4s is 4, which becomes the central number in the output.
- In Example 2, the central number in the pattern of 2s and 3s is 3, which becomes the central number in the output.
- In Example 3, the central number in the pattern of 1s and 7s is 2, which becomes the central number in the output.

The rule seems to be that the output is a smaller grid (3x3) where the central number corresponds to the central number of a pattern found in the input, and the surrounding numbers represent the presence or absence of other elements around that center in the input grid. Specifically, the output has the central element from the input grid and the surrounding elements reflect the nearest adjacent non-zero elements.

For the Test Case:
- We have a pattern of 1s and 3s.
- The central 1 (which is surrounded by zeros on all sides) is not present in the pattern anymore, so we look at the closest surrounding non-zero element, which is a 3.

Thus, the transformation should create a 3x3 grid with the central number being 3 and the surrounding numbers representing the nearest adjacent elements around the central number, which in this case are all zeros since there are no adjacent elements to the central 3s within the range of the 3x3 grid.

Hence, the solution for the test case would be:

ba26e723,"Let's examine the pattern in each row of the provided examples:

In every example, we notice that the number '4' in the input is replaced with '6' in the output at specific positions. These positions seem to be where '4' is surrounded on both sides by zeros ('0') or where '4' is at the start or end of a row.

To determine the exact transformation rule, let's apply this observation to each row:

1. For the first row:
   - A '4' is changed to '6' if it's surrounded by '0', at the beginning or end of the row.
   
2. For the second row:
   - All '4's remain '4', except those that are followed by another '4' and preceded by a '4' where they get changed to '6'.
   
3. For the third row:
   - A '4' is changed to '6' if it's surrounded by '0', at the beginning or end of the row.

Now, let's apply this rule to the rows of the test case:

Input:
```
[
[0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0],

[4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4]
]

First row transformation (following the rule):
- '4' surrounded by '0': Change to '6'
- At the start or end of the row: Change to '6'

Output for the first row:
```python
[6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6]
```

Second row transformation (following the rule):
- Sequence of '4's not bordered by '0': No change
- Sequence ends at an edge: No change

Output for the second row:
```python
[6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6]
```

Third row transformation (following the rule):
- '4' surrounded by '0': Change to '6'
- At the start or end of the row: Change to '6'

Output for the third row:
```python
[6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6]

```
Output:
```

From these examples, we can observe that:
- In Example 1, all 4s in the input become 5s in the output.
- In Example 2, all 6s in the input become 5s in the output.
- In Example 3, both 2s and 4s in the input become 0s in the output, while all 9s become 5s.
- In Example 4, all 2s in the input become 0s in the output, and all 4s become 5s.

Based on the above observations, it seems there isn’t a consistent single transformation rule that applies to every number across different examples. However, the pattern seems to involve converting certain numbers to 0 and others to 5. The commonality is that the 4s and 2s are converted to 0s, whereas other numbers are sometimes converted to 5s based on their occurrence in other rows.

Let’s re-evaluate the conversion rules more specifically:
- If a number appears in the first row, it gets replaced by 0 if it appears in any other row.
- If a number does not appear in the first row but does appear in the second or third row, it gets replaced by 5 if it is the only number of its kind in that row.

Applying this reasoning to the test case:
Input:
```
[
[4, 4, 4],
[3, 2, 3],
[8, 8, 8]]
```

Following the identified logic:
- All 4s from the first row should be replaced with 0 because they also appear in the first row.
- Numbers 3 and 2 in the second row are replaced with 0 because they also appear in other rows (3 appears in the third row, 2 appears in the first row).
- All 8s in the third row should be replaced with 5 because it is the only row that contains 8s.

Therefore, the output should be:
```

[0, 0, 0],

From Example 1:
- The vertical strip of 2's remains unchanged.
- The horizontal strip of 1's gets its middle column modified by replacing some 1's with 8's.
- The single block of 3's at the bottom gets its middle row modified by replacing some 3's with 8's.

From Example 2:
- The vertical strip of 2's gets its middle row modified by replacing some 2's with 8's.
- The horizontal strip of 1's gets its middle three columns modified by replacing some 1's with 8's.
- The single block of 3's remains mostly unchanged, but its middle column and rows get modified by replacing some 3's with 8's.

From Example 3:
- The vertical strip of 1's gets its middle three columns modified by replacing some 1's with 8's.
- The single block of 2's in the center gets its middle two rows and columns modified by replacing some 2's with 8's.
- The single block of 3's gets its middle column and rows modified by replacing some 3's with 8's.

The common pattern seems to be that any contiguous block of numbers (vertically or horizontally) that is more than one number wide has its middle row/column (or rows/columns if the width/height is more than two) replaced with 8's. For squares, the central cross (row and column) is replaced.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- The vertical strip of 1's gets its middle three columns modified by replacing some 1's with 8's.
- The horizontal strip of 2's remains unchanged.
- The single block of 3's at the bottom right gets its middle row and column modified by replacing some 3's with 8's.

952a094c,"Let's analyze the transformation rule by observing the differences between the provided input and output grids:

In all examples, we note that the outermost rows and columns that contain any non-zero value are being flipped into the corners of the grid with specific patterns. We'll break down each example:

**Example 1:**
- Input has a pattern of '8' forming a rectangle in the middle.
- In the output, the first and last row have non-zero values only at positions corresponding to where the '8' was on the edges of the original rectangle.
- The first column has non-zero values corresponding to the left edge of the original rectangle, and the last column corresponds to the right edge.

**Example 2:**
- The input has '7' forming a rectangle in the middle.
- The output shows a similar flipping mechanism, with the pattern of '7' being reflected on the edges of the grid in the corners and side edges.

**Example 3:**
- Here, '1' forms a rectangle in the middle.
- The non-zero values in the input are spread on the edges of the rectangle, which in the output are placed in the corners and along the edges.

Based on these observations, the general rule seems to be:
- For the first and last row, if there is a non-zero value in the middle rectangle, place that value in the corresponding corner or edge position of the first and last row.
- For the first and last column, do the same based on the middle rectangle's edge values.

In the test case:
- There is a rectangle of '3' in the middle.
- The surrounding rows and columns should be filled based on the edge values of the rectangle.

Given this, let's apply the pattern to the test case:
- The first and last row will have '3' in the third and seventh positions.
- The first and last column will have '3' in the fourth, fifth, sixth, and eighth positions.

Therefore, the grid after applying the rule will look like this:
```python
[
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],

c3e719e8,"To figure out the rule being applied here, let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples step-by-step:

1. We can see that the output grid increases in size relative to the input grid. For instance, in Example 1, the original 3x3 grid is expanded into a 9x9 grid.
2. The numbers in the input grid are repeated three times horizontally in the output grid.
3. After repeating the numbers horizontally, the entire row is padded with zeros to make the width of the row equal to nine (the width of the larger grid).
4. This process is repeated vertically, meaning that each set of these zero-padded rows is replicated three times, filling up the rest of the 9x9 grid.

Given this information, we can apply this transformation to the test case. Here’s how we do it step by step:

- The input is a 3x3 grid:
  [
  [1, 1, 7],
  [7, 4, 1],
  [5, 1, 7]]
  
- Repeat each row three times and pad with zeros to achieve a length of nine:
  [
  [1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7],
  [7, 4, 1, 7, 4, 1, 7, 4, 1],
  [5, 1, 7, 5, 1, 7, 5, 1, 7]]

- Now replicate each of those lines three times:
  [
  [1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7],
  [1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7],
  [1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7],
  [7, 4, 1, 7, 4, 1, 7, 4, 1],
  [7, 4, 1, 7, 4, 1, 7, 4, 1],
  [7, 4, 1, 7, 4, 1, 7, 4, 1],
  [5, 1, 7, 5, 1, 7, 5, 1, 7],
  [5, 1, 7, 5, 1, 7, 5, 1, 7],
  [5, 1, 7, 5, 1, 7, 5, 1, 7]]

Following the pattern described above, the result should be:

623ea044,"To understand the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's analyze the provided examples.

In Example 1, there is a single color '2' in the middle of the input grid. In the output grid, '2' appears symmetrically about the central row and column, forming a cross pattern with the '2' at its center.

In Example 2, there is a single color '7' in the sixth row and seventh column of the input grid. In the output grid, '7' appears symmetrically about the central row and column, mirroring itself across the grid.

In Example 3, there is a single color '8' in the eighth row and seventh column. Similar to the previous examples, the output grid has '8' appearing symmetrically across the central points, creating a pattern that mirrors the original position.

From these examples, we can infer that the transformation rule is:

- Identify the first non-zero value in the input grid.
- Create a symmetrical pattern in the output grid around the central point of the grid where this value was located, spreading out to each quadrant.
- The number identified spreads to all positions at an equal distance from the center as the original position but in a mirrored fashion.

Given the test case, there is a single color '6' in the eighth row and eighth column. Applying the above rule, the number '6' will appear symmetrically around the central point of the grid, which is also the eighth row and eighth column in this case since the grid size is even.

Let's transform the test case grid based on the identified rule.

a5f85a15,"To determine the rule transforming the input grids to their respective outputs, we should closely examine the changes made in each example.

### Example 1 Analysis
- In the first row, the `2` remains the same because it is not directly above or below another `2`.
- In the second row, the `2` is replaced with a `4`. This `2` is directly above another `2` in the third row.
- In the third row, the `2` remains the same because there's no corresponding `2` above it.

### Example 2 Analysis
- Each `9` that has another `9` directly above it is replaced by `4`.

### Example 3 Analysis
- Each `3` that has another `3` directly above it is replaced by `4`.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:
- If an element in the input grid is `X` (where `X` is any color), and there is also an `X` directly above it within the same column, then the `X` in the output grid is incremented by `2` modulo `10` (resulting in `4` when `X=2`, `4` when `X=4`, etc.).

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case
We apply this rule to the test case. We increment the color of each element that has another same-colored element directly above it by `2`, taking into account the modulo `10` operation if necessary.

Let's break down the test case:

- The first occurrence of `6` does not change as there is no `6` above it in the same column.
- The second row contains a `6` which directly follows another `6` in the first row; hence, the `6` gets transformed to `8`.
- The third row contains `6` which directly follows another `6` in the second row; hence, the `6` gets transformed to `8`.
- The fourth row contains `6` which directly follows another `6` in the third row; hence, the `6` gets transformed to `8`.
- And so on...

Given this pattern, we need to modify the elements in the rows where the previous element in the same column is the same.

#### Applying the Transformation
The test case is:
```

[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

5c0a986e,"To figure out the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids, I'll carefully analyze the differences between the inputs and outputs in all three examples.

Observation:
- In Example 1, the color 1 is spread across the top two rows.
- In Example 2, the color 1 appears diagonally from the second row to the eighth row, filling gaps in the left side of the color 2 block.
- In Example 3, the color 1 is placed one row above and one column to the left of the first occurrence of color 2 within the grid, spreading upwards and to the left in a similar diagonal fashion to that seen in Example 2.

Based on these observations, we can deduce a pattern:
The transformation rule seems to involve placing the value 1 in locations directly above and to the left of any non-zero value (any color other than 0) in the input grid, spreading in a diagonal from the top-left towards the bottom-right.

Let's apply this rule to the Test Case:

In Example 1, we see that the input grid is:
```
[
[0, 7, 7],
[7, 7, 7],
[0, 7, 7]]
```
And the output grid is:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7],

We can observe that the input grid has been expanded into a 9x9 grid and certain patterns emerge based on the original color placements.

In Example 2, the pattern is similar:

```

From these examples, we can deduce that the transformation consists of repeating each row twice horizontally and stacking two copies of the entire 3-row grid vertically, resulting in a 9x9 grid. Additionally, when an element is repeated across the new row, if there was a zero in the original position, zeros are added around it in the new row.

Considering the Test case:
Input
```
[
[7, 0, 7],
[7, 0, 7],
[7, 7, 0]]
```

We follow the transformation rules:

1. **Repeat each row twice horizontally:**
   - Row 1: `[7, 0, 7]` becomes `[7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7]`
   - Row 2: `[7, 0, 7]` becomes `[7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7]`
   - Row 3: `[7, 7, 0]` becomes `[7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]`

2. **Stack these rows twice vertically:**
   - Rows 1-3 duplicated become rows 4-6.
   - Rows 1-3 again duplicated become rows 7-9.

Thus, the output grid would be:
```

017c7c7b,"The pattern observed in the transformations is that each row in the output corresponds to two rows in the input: the first value of each input row remains the same, but if there's a '1' in an input row, it is replaced with a '2' in the output. If the input consists of a single row with all '1's, it would be doubled in the output, maintaining the replacement rule. 

Given the test case input:
[
[1, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0],
[1, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0]]

Applying the transformation rule:
- Each '1' in the input becomes a '2' in the output.
- Each row is duplicated.

The output should therefore look like:
[
[1, 2, 1],
[0, 2, 0],
[1, 2, 1],
[0, 2, 0],
[1, 2, 1],
[0, 2, 0],
[0, 2, 0],
[1, 2, 1],
[0, 2, 0],
[0, 2, 0],
[1, 2, 1],
[0, 2, 0],
[0, 2, 0],
[1, 2, 1],
[0, 2, 0]]

However, it seems I made an error in my reasoning. Based on the provided examples, every '1' in the input gets replaced with '2' in the output while every '0' remains unchanged, and the input rows get duplicated in pairs rather than doubling each row individually. So the correct transformation for the test case would involve duplicating each row and replacing '1' with '2'.

Let's fix this and correctly apply the transformation rule:

Test Case Transformation:
[
[1, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0],
[1, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0]]

Each '1' becomes '2', and each row is duplicated:
[
[1, 2, 1],
[0, 2, 0],
[1, 2, 1],
[0, 2, 0],
[1, 2, 1],

[0, 2, 0],

f25fbde4,"To understand the transformation rule from the inputs to the outputs provided in the examples, let's analyze what changes occur in each case:

1. In Example 1, the original input has a block of '4' surrounded by zeros. In the output, the block of '4' is expanded horizontally to fill up the space between the first and last non-zero columns and vertically to fill the space between the first and last non-zero rows where a '4' was present.

2. In Example 2, there are two separate blocks of '4' in the input. Each block is expanded similarly to Example 1, such that they fill their respective spaces, but remain separate from one another.

3. In Example 3, there is an elongated 'L'-shaped block of '4' in the input. This block is also expanded to fill its respective spaces in the output grid, maintaining the 'L' shape.

Based on these observations, it seems the rule is to take any contiguous block of '4' and expand it to fill all the cells in the rectangle defined by the block's outermost cells. Blocks of '4' are treated separately if they are not connected.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

The test case has two separate '4' blocks - one vertical and one horizontal. Let's expand these blocks independently.

- The vertical '4' block is located at columns 4 and 6, rows 2 and 3 through 4.
- The horizontal '4' block is located at row 5, columns 3 through 6.

Expanding these blocks according to the rule gives us:

Answer: ```[[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]]```","[[0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0]

9af7a82c,"To figure out the transformation rule, let's analyze the relationship between the input and output grids in the provided examples:

1. In Example 1, we see that the first column of numbers in the input becomes the first two columns of numbers in the output, shifted up and filled with zeros below. The second column becomes the third and fourth columns, also shifted up and filled with zeros. The final column in the input is repeated as the fifth column in the output.

2. Similar patterns are observed in Example 2 and Example 3:
   - Example 2: The first column shifts up and has zeros added below, and so on for other columns.
   - Example 3: The output starts with the third column, then the second, followed by the first, and finally adds two additional zero-filled columns.

3. In Example 4, the pattern remains consistent where each column of the input is transformed into two columns in the output starting from the leftmost column, moving rightward, and each pair of new columns contains the old column shifted up and padded with zeros at the bottom.

From the examples above, it appears that the transformation rule involves duplicating each column in the input grid as two columns in the output grid, with the first new column containing the original column values shifted up and the second new column being filled with zeros below the original values. If there aren't enough rows to create pairs of columns, remaining columns are extended with zeros until they fill the required number of rows.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:

Input:
```
[
[8, 8, 2, 2],
[1, 8, 8, 2],
[1, 3, 3, 4],
[1, 1, 1, 1]]
```

We duplicate each column and shift the top values upwards in the new grid, filling the rest with zeros. This results in:

Output:
```
[
[1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8],
[1, 3, 3, 4, 8, 8],
[1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 2],
[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2],
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

However, upon closer inspection of the rules from the examples, it seems that each original column in the input is turned into two columns in the output without the bottom rows extending beyond the original rows' count, padding only within the necessary context.

Therefore, applying the rule correctly and ensuring that the zero-padding does not extend beyond the necessary rows, the output would actually look like this:
```

ec883f72,"To figure out the pattern in these transformations, we need to analyze how the outputs change relative to their respective inputs.

### Observations:
- In **Example 1**, the color `3` appears at the bottom two rows, first column.
- In **Example 2**, the color `6` appears in the middle row, first and last columns.
- In **Example 3**, the color `2` appears along the rightmost column and in the third row.
- In **Example 4**, the color `4` appears in the top four rows, in diagonal positions starting from the end of those rows.

### Hypothesis:
From these examples, it looks like the transformation involves adding an extension of specific color at the edges of the grid starting from any non-zero value found within the grid, moving outward towards the corners.

### Rule Determination:
The new value added to the edge seems to be the color of the lowest non-zero value in the input grid that is not already on the edge. Then, that color spreads diagonally or horizontally/vertically from that spot until it reaches the corners.

Let's apply this to the Test Case:

#### Step-by-step process for the Test Case:
1. **Identify the lowest non-zero value in the grid**: In the test case, the lowest non-zero value is `3` (there are also `4`, but `3` comes before `4`).
2. **Locate the position of the `3` inside the grid**:
   - The value `3` appears in several places, starting from the fifth row upwards.

3. **Apply the transformation rule**:
   - Since `3` is the lowest non-zero value, we place `3` in the first row and the last column of the grid, then spread it diagonally towards the top-right corner.
   - We add `3`s to the first row's last three columns and to the last column's first three rows.

4. **Final output**:
   - The `3`s appear in the first row's last three columns and the last column's first three rows.
   - The rest of the input grid remains unchanged.

First, observe the structure of the input and output grids in both examples. Both inputs have a 3x3 structure, while the outputs are consistently 9x9 in size.

6c434453,"To determine the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's examine the changes closely:

In Example 1:
- Every occurrence of '1' in the input becomes either '0' or '2' in the output.
- It appears that '1's on the boundaries or at the outer edges of contiguous blocks of '1's change to '0', while those surrounded by '1's change to '2'.
- Other numbers (mainly '0') remain unchanged.

In Example 2:
- We observe similar behavior where '1's are replaced by '0' or '2' based on their positions within the structure.
- Again, '0's remain unchanged.

Let's apply these rules to the Test case:

[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],

[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]]

Step-by-step transformation:
1. First, identify all '1's that are surrounded by other '1's. These '1's should become '2'.
2. Second, identify all '1's that are on the edge of a contiguous block or isolated. These '1's should become '0'.
3. Finally, keep all '0's as they are.

Based on these observations:
- The first column and row have only one '1' which are on the boundary and should transform to '0'.
- In the center cluster of '1's, the ones that are not on the edge (surrounded by others) should transform to '2'.
- Isolated '1's (like the single '1' in the first row) should also become '0'.

Therefore, the transformed grid should look like this:

d22278a0,"To determine the transformation rule, we can observe patterns in the output grids based on the inputs:

1. The non-zero numbers in the first row of the input seem to dictate a pattern that affects all rows below.
2. In the outputs, the first number in the input's first row repeats throughout the columns.
3. After the first instance of the second number (if present) in the input's first row, the pattern changes.
4. Rows below the first one get modified according to these rules, with zeros often becoming a mix of the first and second numbers or staying zero based on their position relative to the previous pattern.

Using this logic, let's apply the observed pattern to the test case:

Input has [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] in the first row. Then followed by many rows of zeros until the last row which includes an 8 at the start, a zero in the middle, and a 1 at the end.

From the first row's pattern:
- Replace all zeros with 4s initially.
- When the 8 is encountered in the last row, replace zeros starting from the column after 8 with 8, while keeping the pattern of 4s before the 8.
- Finally, when the 1 is encountered at the last column, replace the zeros leading up to the final column with 1s.

Applying this rule to the test case would make the grid look like this:

1f642eb9,"To identify the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's examine the changes in each example:

### Example 1
- In row 4, color `8` is adjacent to color `9`. It turns into `9`.
- In row 5, color `8` remains unchanged.
- In row 6, the first `8` turns into `6`, while the second `8` remains unchanged.
- In row 7, the first color `8` turns to `6`. 
- In row 10, color `4` remains unchanged.

From these observations, I can propose that the rule is:
- If a cell with value `X` has a non-zero neighbor on the left, the cell value becomes the value of the neighbor (left precedence).
- If a cell with value `X` has no non-zero neighbors on the left but does have a non-zero neighbor directly above it, the cell value becomes the value of the top neighbor.
- Otherwise, the cell value remains unchanged.

### Example 2
- In row 4, the first `8` turns into `6`, while the rest remain the same.
- In row 5, the first `8` turns into `3`.
- In row 8, the first `8` turns into `3`.
- In row 9, the first `8` turns into `7`.

This seems consistent with the rule proposed:

### Example 3
- The transformation is similar. Row 4 sees the first `8` becoming `4` because it has a `4` to its left,
- Row 5 sees the first `8` becoming `3` because it has a `3` to its left.
- Row 7 sees the first `8` becoming `2` due to the `2` to its left,
- Row 8 sees the first `8` becoming `7` due to the `7` to its left.

Based on these patterns, we can deduce that the transformation is replacing a cell's color with the color of its nearest non-zero left or top neighbor if such a neighbor exists, otherwise leaving the cell unchanged.

### Applying to Test Case
Let's apply the identified rule to the test case:

1. Row 4, column 4: `8` is replaced by `9` (nearest non-zero left neighbor).
2. Row 4, column 5: First `8` is replaced by `9`, remaining `8`s stay the same.
3. Row 5, column 4: `8` is replaced by `9` (nearest non-zero top neighbor).
4. Row 5, column 5: Same `8` pattern, the first one is replaced by `9`.
5. Row 6, column 4: `8` is replaced by `3` (nearest non-zero top neighbor).
6. Row 6, column 5: Also `3`.
7. Row 7, column 4: `8` is replaced by `4` (nearest non-zero top neighbor).
8. Row 7, column 5: Also `4`.
9. Row 10, column 6: `6` remains the same as it has no non-zero neighbors to the left or above.
10. Row 10, column 9: `0` remains the same.

The result would be:

ae4f1146,"To figure out the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids, let's first analyze the provided examples:

1. In Example 1, there's a pattern of color blocks that get condensed and transformed into smaller, specific arrangements.
2. In Example 2, a similar condensation occurs, but note that certain patterns might result in different values appearing in the output.
3. In Example 3, the same block pattern appears again, yielding a familiar output despite the initial grid's different positioning of zeroes.
4. In Example 4, another distinct pattern gives us an output with a different arrangement.

Upon closer inspection, the output of these transformations seems to be a 3x3 grid where all instances of 8 appear as 8, and all instances of 1 appear as 1, regardless of their positioning in the input grid. It appears that the rule involves keeping only the 8s and 1s in a central 3x3 area of the input grid while discarding everything else.

Following this reasoning, the output should consist of extracting the central 3x3 part from the input grid and retaining only the digits 8 and 1.

Now, let's apply the same rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8], 
 [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 1], 
 [1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8], 
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8]]
```

The central 3x3 grid (with the 8s and 1s retained) would be:
```
[[8, 1, 8], 
 [1, 8, 1], 
 [0, 0, 1]]
```

However, since the output only contains 8s and 1s, we change any other value (like 0) to nothing or ensure they do not appear in the final grid. So the final output should be:
```
[[8, 1, 8], 
 [1, 8, 1], 
 [0, 0, 1]] -> [[8, 1, 8], 
                [1, 8, 1], 
                [0, 0, 1]] (after removing 0s not next to 8 or 1)
```

After analyzing, the cleanest output, removing unnecessary zeroes, would be:
```
[[8, 1, 8],

a68b268e,"To figure out the transformation rule applied to the input grids to generate the output grids, let's first analyze the pattern between each corresponding input and output:

1. **Observation on Input/Output Transformation**:
    - Each output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid (from a 9x9 grid to a 4x4 grid).
    - The transformation seems to involve focusing on specific areas within the input grid that contain the color '1'.
    - We need to understand what determines the values in the output grid.

2. **Identifying the Pattern**:
    - Looking at the provided examples, we notice that the output grid consists of the values present in certain rows and columns of the input grid.
    - Particularly, the output grid seems to be composed of the intersection points of the rows and columns where color '1' appears in the middle row and column of the input grid (rows and columns 4 and 5, if indexing starts from 0).

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
    - In Example 1, the output focuses on the elements from rows 0 to 3 and columns 0 to 8 where there is a '1', but especially around the column 4.
    - In Example 2, similar logic applies with respect to rows 0 to 3 and columns 0 to 8.
    - This rule is consistent across all examples.

4. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**:
    - For the Test case, consider the input grid and focus on the intersection of rows 0 to 3 and columns 0 to 8.
    - Take the relevant values from these positions to form the output grid.

Following these observations, here is how the Test case input would be transformed:

Input Grid:
```

 [7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0],
 [0, 7, 7, 0, 1, 4, 4, 0, 4],

 [8, 0, 8, 0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6],
 [0, 8, 0, 8, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0]
]
```

The output grid would be formed by extracting the elements from these rows and columns where '1' appears, particularly around row 4 and column 4:

```
[
 [7, 7, 7, 0],  # row 0
 [0, 7, 7, 0],  # row 1
 [7, 7, 7, 7],  # row 2

```

So, the solution for the Test case according to the identified transformation rule is:

85c4e7cd,"To find the transformation rule from the inputs to the outputs, let's analyze the given examples:

Example 1: It seems that each number in the output grid is one less than its corresponding number in the input grid, except the outermost layer which has 4 in the input and 8 in the output.

Example 2: Similarly, each interior number in the output grid is one less than its corresponding number in the input grid, while the outermost layer changes from 2 to 6.

Example 3: Each interior number decreases by one in the output, and the exterior layer changes from 8 to 4.

Example 4: The pattern continues with the outermost layer changing from 8 to 3 and each interior number decreasing by one in value.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following rule:
- If a cell contains the value 1 in the input, transform it to 2 in the output.
- Otherwise, for non-border cells (cells not at the edge of the grid), decrease their value by 1.
- For border cells, change their value to a specific number determined by the size of the color block around them. In particular, the outermost layer's value is replaced by whatever number would be left if all other rules were applied, but adjusted to fit the outermost position.

For the test case, applying the above rule:
The input grid is symmetrical and consists of concentric layers. Each inner layer's color is decreased by one for its corresponding output layer's color, until reaching the innermost layer of color 8, where 8 becomes 7, and so on. The exterior layer of 8s should become 6s since the next smaller layer's values are all 7.

d06dbe63,"To determine the transformation rule from input to output, we'll analyze the two training examples provided:

In Example 1, there is a single ""8"" at the center of the grid in the fifth row and fourth column. The output shows that the color '5' has been spread outwards from this point symmetrically in a pattern that resembles a cross or plus sign centered at the location of the ""8"". 

Similarly, in Example 2, there is an ""8"" located in the seventh row and seventh column. The output again depicts a symmetrical cross or plus sign around this point with the digit '5'.

From these observations, it can be concluded that the transformation rule is to replace the number ""8"" with '5' and fill the adjacent cells symmetrically with numbers '5', creating a cross shape centered on the original position of the ""8"".

Given the Test case with an ""8"" located in the sixth row and sixth column:
- A cross pattern should be formed by filling the surrounding cells with '5'.
- The cross pattern would extend two cells left (4th column) and right (8th column), as well as upwards (rows 4 through 6) and downwards (rows 6 through 8), including the central cell.

Thus, the transformation for the Test case is as follows:

ea786f4a,"To find the transformation rule, let's examine the patterns in the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the center of the grid (which is a 3x3 square) has its central value (0) preserved while the surrounding values (1) are transformed to 0, except for the cells adjacent diagonally to the central cell.

2. In Example 2, a similar pattern is followed. The center of the grid is a 5x5 square with an empty spot (0) in the middle. All the cells around that empty spot are 2, but when we look at the output, these cells are replaced by alternating 0s and 2s, starting with a 0 at the corners and ending with a 0 at the opposite corners.

3. In Example 3, the pattern continues with a 7x7 grid. The single empty value (0) in the center retains its position but is surrounded by alternating 0s and 3s, again starting with a 0 at the corners.

From these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves alternating the surrounding numbers (keeping their original number but interspersing them with 0s). The alternating pattern begins at the outermost layer and moves inward, always starting and ending with 0s in the corners of the sub-grid formed by the surrounding numbers.

Applying the same rule to the test case:
- We have a 11x11 grid.
- The center contains a single 0.
- Surrounding this center, the numbers form a 9x9 grid of 6s.

The alternating pattern should start from the outside of this 9x9 grid and move inward. As per the examples, it starts with 0s at the corners, and alternates 0s and 6s until reaching the central 0. Thus, we get:

Based on these examples, the transformation rule seems to be transposing the grid, meaning swapping rows with columns.

So, let's transpose the Test Case grid:

Test Case Input:
```
[
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Transposing the grid, we swap the positions of the rows and columns. Here's how it works out:

- The first row becomes the first column.
- The second row becomes the second column.
- And so forth.

Applying this rule, the output is:

Upon careful observation, it seems that the value at position [0][0] (the top-left corner) moves down one row and to the right one column in each subsequent transformation. After reaching the bottom-right corner or an equivalent position, it wraps around back to the top-left corner.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Test Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0],
[5, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 5]
]
```
Since the top-left corner (position [0][0]) has a '0', it will move down to [1][1], where the current value is already '5'. According to the pattern observed, the '0' should replace the '5' at [1][1].

Therefore, the transformed test output should be:

72ca375d,"To solve the transformation rule from input to output, let's analyze the provided examples.

In Example 1, the input features color 2 and 7. The output contains only color 6. This implies that the output color is derived solely based on the presence of certain colors in the input, rather than their positions or sequence directly.
- All instances of color 2 and 7 have been replaced with color 6 in the output while maintaining the structure of continuous blocks of the same color.

In Example 2, the input features color 4, 8, and 2. The output contains only the first instance of color 4. 
- There is no color 6 in the output despite its presence in the input, which suggests that color 6 is not carried over into the output grid. Instead, the output seems to select color 4 and maintain its block's shape in the smallest possible form.

In Example 3, the output consists of color 5 and color 8.
- Color 5 appears in the output where it was present in the input grid, even if surrounded by other colors.
- Color 8 appears similarly, but it's worth noting that the output grid includes only the largest contiguous block of color 8 found in the input.

Based on these patterns, it appears the transformation rule selects the largest contiguous block of the highest color number found in the input grid and represents it in a compact form in the output grid.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- Highest color is 9, and the largest contiguous block of 9 spans four columns across rows 2 to 4.
- The second highest color is 3 and 4, both spanning in different directions, but since we're interested in the largest contiguous block of the highest color, we'll focus on the block of 9.
- The output should then be a compact representation of the largest contiguous block of 9s.

The largest contiguous block of 9s forms a rectangle of size 3x2.

Therefore, the answer should be:

The color '8' in the Input grid is replaced with '2' in the Output grid when surrounded by at least one '0', and color '8' is replaced with '1' where '8' is enclosed by other '8's.

We will replace '8's surrounded by '0's with '2's, and those surrounded by other '8's with '1's:

```
[
[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], # '8's in positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,7) ... are surrounded by other '8's
[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], # '8' in position (2,3) is surrounded by '0's
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], # '8' in position (4,4) is surrounded by '0's
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

The transformation rule here is that the pattern in the input grid is also shifted down by one row, but only within the bounds of the grid. If a color at the edge of the grid needs to shift past the edge, it simply wraps around to the top of the grid instead.

Based on these patterns, we can now apply the transformation rule to the test case.

60b61512,"To determine the transformation rule from the given examples, let's analyze the changes that occur in each of them.

In Example 1:
- The pattern of 4s in row 2 shifts to the right in row 3.
- In row 3, the first column becomes 7, and the third column remains 4.
- For row 4, the first two columns become 7, and the third column remains 4.
- Similarly, for row 5, the fourth and fifth columns shift down into rows 6 and 7, with the fifth column becoming 7 in row 6 and the fourth column becoming 7 in row 7.

In Example 2:
- The pattern of 4s in row 2 also shifts to the right in row 3.
- For row 3, the second column becomes 7, and the third column remains 4.
- The pattern of 4s in row 5 shifts down into rows 6 and 7, with the sixth column becoming 7 in row 7 and row 6.

From these observations, we can infer that the rule involves replacing a '4' in a cell if that cell has another '4' immediately to its left or above it with a '7'. However, cells at the far left and topmost positions (without a '4' to their immediate left or above) are unaffected.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:

The pattern starts with a single '4' in the middle of row 2. It moves to the right in row 3, where the '4' in the third column changes to a '7'. Row 4 has no change since there's no '4' to its immediate left in row 3.

Row 5 onwards contains isolated '4's that do not have a '4' to their immediate left or above; hence, they remain unchanged. 

For row 8, there are three consecutive '4's. Applying the rule, every '4' in row 8 becomes '7', except the last one which remains a '4'.

So, the Test Case would look like this after applying the rule:

67e8384a,"To figure out the transformation rule that turns the input into the output, let's examine the patterns in the provided examples.

In all cases, the output doubles the horizontal and vertical size of the input grid while maintaining symmetry. This can be achieved by mirroring the grid along both its vertical and horizontal axes.

Let's break down the process using the first training example:

Input:
```
[
[5, 3, 4],
[3, 4, 5],
[3, 4, 4]]
```

We begin by adding a mirrored version horizontally and vertically:
- Horizontally mirror the grid.
- Then add a mirrored version along the vertical axis on the right side.

The horizontally mirrored version would look like:
```
[
[4, 3, 5],
[5, 4, 3],
[4, 4, 3]]
```

Now we add this horizontally mirrored version next to the original grid:
```
[
[5, 3, 4, 4, 3, 5],
[3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3],
[3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3]]
```

Then we vertically mirror the whole new grid (including the horizontally mirrored part) and append it below the current grid:
```
[
[5, 3, 4, 4, 3, 5],
[3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3],
[3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3],
[3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3],
[3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3],
[5, 3, 4, 4, 3, 5]]
```

Following this rule, let's apply the transformation to the test case input.

Test Case Input:
```
[
[1, 6, 6],
[5, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2]]
```

Horizontally Mirrored:
```
[
[6, 6, 1],
[2, 2, 5],
[2, 2, 2]]
```

Adding horizontally mirrored version next to the original:
```
[
[1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1],
[5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]
```

Vertically mirroring the whole grid:
```
[
[1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1],
[5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5],

e8dc4411,"To figure out the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the provided inputs and outputs:

1. **Grid Expansion Rule:** The first observation is that in all cases, the output grid expands the area around any 0 (which seems to act as a seed) in all directions until the edge of the original non-0 border is reached.

2. **Color Propagation Rule:** The 0 value is replaced by the closest non-zero value horizontally or vertically (if there is one), propagating this color outward from the central zero region.

Let's apply these rules to the test case:

- We start with a grid where all cells have the value 3 except for certain cells containing 6 and 0.

- The propagation starts from the cells containing 0 and looks at their neighboring cells to find the nearest non-zero value, which is 3.

- In the example, we see that wherever there is a 0, it gets replaced by 3, and this 3 spreads outward in all directions until it reaches the edge defined by another number (in this case, it's the constant 3 borders).

- After examining the pattern carefully, it seems the propagation also respects other non-3 numbers, spreading them out but stopping at an edge if another non-0 number is found.

Given these observations, we can create the output grid for the test case:

- Cells with 0 will be replaced by 3.
- Cells around those 0s will also change to 3, spreading outwards in all directions until they encounter other non-zero cells.

Applying this to the test case:

3428a4f5,"To solve the puzzle, we need to identify the rule that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the provided examples.

Analyzing the transformations:
- From Example 1 and subsequent examples, it seems that whenever there is a '2' in the input grid, the corresponding cell in the output grid gets a '3'.
- However, there's also an interesting pattern where some cells containing '2' do not get transformed when surrounded by other '2' cells in certain configurations.
- Specifically, if a '2' is surrounded completely by itself ('2') in a 3x3 area centered around that cell, it does not get changed to '3'. This includes diagonals; for instance, if the top-left, top-center, top-right, center-left, center-center, bottom-left, bottom-center, and/or bottom-right cells are all '2', the original '2' does not change.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
``` 
[
[2, 0, 2, 2, 0],
[2, 0, 0, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 0, 0],

[0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
[2, 0, 2, 2, 0],
[2, 0, 2, 2, 2]
]
```

Applying the rule:
- We scan through the input grid and check each '2' along with its surrounding grid cells (if such cells exist).
- If a '2' is not fully surrounded by '2' in a 3x3 pattern, it is replaced by '3'.

After checking every '2' in the grid for the surrounding pattern, the output looks like this:

Output:
```

From these observations, the rule seems to be replacing every contiguous horizontal block of '2's with a vertical block of '9's. Let's apply this rule to the test case to see if we get a consistent result:

The test case has several horizontal blocks of '2's.
- The first row has three '2's at the beginning of the row forming a horizontal block.
- The second row has another horizontal '2' block in the middle.
- The third row has no such horizontal blocks.
- The fourth row has a horizontal '2' block in the middle.
- The fifth row has no such horizontal blocks.
- The sixth row has a horizontal '2' block in the middle and a single '2' at the end.
- The seventh row has a horizontal '2' block in the middle and a single '2' at the end.
- The eighth row has a horizontal '2' block in the middle.
- The ninth and tenth rows have no horizontal blocks of '2's.

Based on the rule, we would replace each of those horizontal blocks with a vertical block of '9's. Therefore, the output should look like this:

99b1bc43,"To determine the rule that transforms the input grids into their respective outputs, let's analyze the provided examples.

In each example, there is an array of numbers below the main grid that looks like [4, 4, 4, 4] which might serve as a separator between different groups of rows. We should focus on the part of the grid above this separator to derive the pattern. Observing the examples closely, we can see that the output grids only contain two values: 0 and 3, where 3 seems to be replacing certain sequences or patterns in the input. In the examples, the color 3 appears in various positions and patterns without any apparent repetition in position but with some consistency in its appearance based on the input configuration surrounding the separator row.

Let's look at the transformations step by step:

### Example 1:
Input:
```
[
[0, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 1],
[1, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 1],
[4, 4, 4, 4],
[0, 2, 0, 2],
[0, 0, 0, 2],
[2, 0, 0, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 0]
]
```

Output:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 3]
]
```

The value `3` appears only after the row consisting entirely of `4`s, indicating a specific change below the separator.
### Example 2:
Input:
```
[
[1, 1, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 1, 0],
[1, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 1, 1, 0],
[4, 4, 4, 4],
[0, 2, 2, 2],
[2, 0, 2, 0],
[2, 2, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 2]
]
```

Output:
```
[
[3, 0, 3, 3],
[0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 0],
[3, 0, 0, 3]
]
```

Similarly, `3` appears in the positions based on the configuration of the rows before the row of `4`s.
### Example 3:
Input:
```
[
[0, 1, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 0],
[4, 4, 4, 4],
[0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 2, 0, 2],
[2, 2, 0, 2],
[0, 2, 0, 0]
]
```

Output:
```
[
[0, 3, 0, 0],
[3, 3, 3, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 3],
[3, 0, 3, 0]
]
```

Again, `3` appears in the output based on the configuration of the input rows.
### Example 4:
Input:
```
[
[1, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 1],
[1, 1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 1],
[4, 4, 4, 4],
[2, 2, 0, 2],
[0, 2, 2, 0],
[2, 0, 2, 2],
[0, 2, 0, 2]
]
```

Output:
```
[
[3, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 3, 3, 0],
[0, 3, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 0, 0]
]
```

From these observations, we can deduce that the rule is transforming some colors (likely 1 and 2) into `3`, based on their arrangement in the rows before the line of `4`s. Let's try to identify the rule further.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that:
- Colors `1` and `2` are being replaced by `3`.
- There's an alternating or neighboring presence of numbers that dictates where `3` appears.
  
For the Test Case:
Given Input:
```python
[
[1, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 1, 1],
[0, 0, 1, 0],
[1, 0, 1, 1],
[4, 4, 4, 4],
[2, 2, 0, 2],
[0, 0, 2, 0],
[2, 0, 0, 2],
[0, 2, 0, 2]
]
```

The rows before [4, 4, 4, 4] show a mix of `1` and `0`, followed by another mix of `2` and `0`. Therefore, according to the observed pattern, the transformations would replace `1` and `2` with `3` as follows:
```python
[
[3, 0, 3, 3],
[0, 3, 3, 3],
[0, 0, 3, 0],
[3, 0, 3, 3],
[0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

We can see that the first four rows contain either `1` or `2` which are directly translated to `3` in the output, while `0` remains unchanged. Rows containing `4`s are ignored, and rows following them are likely used to influence the pattern but not directly translated.

Therefore, the output would be:
Answer: ```[[3, 0, 3, 3], [0, 3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 3, 0], [3, 0, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0]]```","[[3 0 3 3]

 [0 0 0 0]]",True,False,0.0
bc1d5164,"To deduce the transformation rule from the provided training examples, let's analyze how each input grid becomes an output grid:

1. In Example 1, the transformation retains the leftmost and rightmost columns that have the number 8, while also capturing the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners as well as the center row with the number 8.
   
2. In Example 2, the transformation retains the leftmost and rightmost columns with the number 2, and the middle column where 2 appears in the original input.

3. In Example 3, the output consists of the first and last columns where 4 appears along with the third column where there is a 4 in any row.

4. In Example 4, the output includes only the first and last columns with the number 4 and the second column where the 4 appears.

5. In Example 5, the output retains the first and last columns with the number 3 and the middle column where 3 appears as well.

Based on these observations, the pattern seems consistent: the output grid includes the first and last columns of the input grid where non-zero numbers are present, along with the column(s) that contain the non-zero number(s) in between. If there is more than one such column, they all get included if they contain the specific number.

Applying the rule to the test case:
- The first and last columns both contain 1.
- The sixth column also contains 1, which means we should include the sixth column in our output.

Therefore, the transformation of the test input grid should yield:

Answer: ```[[0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1]]```","[[0 0 1]

d364b489,"To understand the transformation from the inputs to the outputs in the given examples, I'll analyze the differences between them:

- Both examples have zeroes replaced with a sequence of numbers in the output.
- When there's a '1' in the input, it seems to be surrounded or followed by a pattern of numbers in the output.
- In the first row where a '1' appears in the input, the output replaces the '1' with '2', and the surrounding numbers follow a specific pattern based on their relative positions to '1'.

Let's observe how the pattern evolves around the '1' in Example 1 more closely.

1. In the row above the '1', the output has '7 6', and in the row below it has '8'.
2. In the row with the '1', the output has '2'.
3. In the row below where the '2' should be, the output places '7 6'. 

A similar pattern happens for other '1's in different rows and columns but shifted according to their locations.

Applying this to the test input:

Starting with the first visible '1' at position [0][1] and [0][9]:
- Surrounding numbers around [0][1]: [1][-1] = 2, [1][0] = 7, [1][1] = 6, [1][2] = 8.
- Surrounding numbers around [0][9]: [1][8] = 6, [1][9] = 7, [1][-2] = 8, [1][-1] = 2.

Next, for the '1' at position [3][3]:
- Surrounding numbers: [2][3] = 7, [4][3] = 8, [3][2] = 6, [3][4] = 2.

And for the '1' at position [7][0] and [9][4]:
- Surrounding numbers around [7][0]: [6][0] = 2, [6][-1] = 8, [8][0] = 7, [8][-1] = 6.
- Surrounding numbers around [9][4]: [8][4] = 2, [8][5] = 6, [9][3] = 7, [9][5] = 8.

Using these observations to fill out the test case:

178fcbfb,"From the examples provided, it appears that the transformation rule applied to the grids involves two steps:

1. Locate the first non-zero element in the grid.
2. Fill the entire grid with the value of this element, but only in the rows and columns containing the first non-zero element.

Let's verify this rule using the training examples:

- Example 1: The first non-zero number in the input grid is 2, located at row 2, column 3. Then, all elements in row 2 and column 3 are changed to 2. Similarly, for the number 3 found at row 5, column 8, all elements in row 5 and column 8 are filled with 3. For the number 1 found at row 7, column 4, all elements in row 7 and column 4 are filled with 1, while also filling the other rows and columns that were previously filled with 2 or 3.

- Example 2: The first non-zero number is 3, located at row 2, column 2. This fills the entire second column and the second row with 3s. The next non-zero numbers are 1 and 2, which fill their respective rows and columns accordingly, resulting in different sections being filled with 1s, and 2s respectively.

- Example 3: Follows the same principle where the first non-zero number (1) is found at row 2, column 2, and it fills the second row and second column with 1s. Then numbers 2 and 3 come into play, affecting their respective rows and columns.

Given this understanding, we can apply it to the test case:
The first non-zero number is 3, located at row 1, column 4. We'll fill the entire fourth column and the first row with 3s. 

Next, the number 2 is found at row 2, column 11, so we'll fill the eleventh column and the second row with 2s.

Lastly, the number 1 is located at row 8, column 2, so we'll fill the second column and the eighth row with 1s.

Applying these transformations gives us this output for the test case:

6855a6e4,"To understand the transformation rule applied to the given examples, let's analyze each one.

In Example 1, the main observable changes are that the 5s in the input grid are moved down to the row just above the last row containing 2s, and any 5s that were not affected by this vertical movement remain unchanged. This suggests that the rule might involve moving all specific values (in this case, 5) as far down as possible within certain constraints.

In Example 2, we see 5s being pushed up into gaps created by 2s but only when there are 2s present both above and below the 5s, indicating that 5s are only moved if they can fit into spaces caused by 2s above them, and do so by moving as close to the top as possible while ensuring no overlap with other 2s. Also, 5s are only moved if there are 2s both above and below it.

In Example 3, the 5s are again moved up and to the left or right if there are 2s present on those positions, suggesting the same rule applies: move 5s vertically upwards into available spots among 2s only if surrounded by 2s.

Therefore, the common rule appears to be:
- If a 5 is surrounded by 2s (either above and below or below), it moves up to an empty spot until it either reaches the top row or encounters a row where there are no more 2s directly above or below it.
- If a 5 is not surrounded by 2s, it remains in its original position.
- Any other colors besides 5 and 2 are unaffected.

Applying this rule to the test case:

1. The first 5 at the top is not surrounded by 2s and remains in place.
2. The 5s in the middle rows are surrounded by 2s above and below them, and should move vertically upwards into available spots among 2s.
   - The first set of 5s (rows [1,2]) would move up into the gap created in row [4] by 2s.
   - The second set of 5s (row [14]) would move up into the gap created in row [10] by 2s.

67a3c6ac,"To figure out the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided pairs of input and output grids. What stands out is that there seems to be a consistent operation applied to each element in the input grid.

Upon closer inspection, it looks like the transformation involves swapping certain color codes: specifically, it appears that the number `6` is being swapped with `2`, and `7` is being swapped with `1`. All other numbers stay the same.

Let's confirm this rule with the examples:

- In Example 1:
    - Input has `6`s and `2`s which are swapped in the output.
    - Input has `1`s and `7`s which are swapped in the output.

- In Example 2:
    - Similar swap patterns for `6` and `2`, and `7` and `1`.

445eab21,"Firstly, I'll analyze the transformation process by comparing the input and output pairs provided.

In Example 1, we have two distinct blocks of color: one block of 7s in the center and another of 8s below the middle. However, only the 8s are represented in the output. This pattern continues in Example 2 and Example 3 where colors 6 and 7, and 4 and 2 respectively, are present in the input, but only one type of color (which seems to be the one appearing more continuously or distinctly) is represented in the output.

Looking at the inputs closely:
- In Example 1, 7s form a cross-like shape which is not represented in the output.
- In Example 2, 6s also form a cross-like shape and do not show up in the output.
- In Example 3, 4s make an elongated cross-like shape but only 4s appear in the output.
- In all these cases, the output contains the continuous blocks that span horizontally across the entire width of the grid and are uninterrupted by any other numbers.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be that:
1. Each row in the input grid is analyzed to see if there's a continuous horizontal block spanning the entire width of the grid.
2. If such a block exists (uninterrupted by any zero), its value is included in the output grid.
3. The output grid consists of the values of these continuous horizontal blocks stacked vertically, with the topmost row in the output corresponding to the first such row found in the input.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:
- Row 0 has a continuous block of 3s.
- Row 1 does not have a continuous block of the same color across the whole row.
- Row 2 does not have a continuous block of the same color across the whole row.
- Row 3 does not have a continuous block of the same color across the whole row.
- Row 4 does not have a continuous block of the same color across the whole row.
- Row 5 does not have a continuous block of the same color across the whole row.
- Row 6 does not have a continuous block of the same color across the whole row.
- Row 7 does not have a continuous block of the same color across the whole row.
- Row 8 has a continuous block of 3s again.
- Row 9 has a continuous block of 9s.

Therefore, the output should consist of the rows containing uninterrupted horizontal blocks of 3s and 9s:

6d0160f0,"To figure out the transformation rule applied to the examples, let's analyze each one individually:

1. In Example 1, every number except 5 has been replaced with 0.

2. Similarly, in Example 2, every number except 5 has also been replaced with 0.

3. In Example 3, every number except 5 and 7 has been replaced with 0. However, note that in the output, all instances of 7 have been removed.

4. In Example 4, every number except 5 has been replaced with 0.

Based on these observations, it appears that the rule involves replacing all numbers other than 5 with 0, and if there are any specific numbers present outside the central column that should not be included in the solution, those are also removed. Specifically, in Example 3, the number 7 was completely removed from the output.

Let's apply this rule to the Test Case:
Firstly, replace all numbers other than 5 with 0.
Secondly, check if there's a specific number that needs to be excluded; in the provided examples, only 7 from Example 3 had such treatment.

d43fd935,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's closely examine the differences between the input and output of the provided examples.

### Example 1 Analysis
- **Input**: The color `1` appears in column 0 and row 4, while color `6` appears in row 1 and 7-9.
- **Output**: Colors `1` and `6` spread diagonally across the grid. The color `1` spreads into the adjacent columns on rows 3 and 4, while `6` spreads across the adjacent rows starting from rows 1 to 9.

### Example 2 Analysis
- **Input**: Colors `7`, `8`, and `3` appear scattered across the matrix.
- **Output**: The colors `7` and `8` spread horizontally or vertically to fill adjacent empty spaces, while `3` remains unchanged or spreads only in its vicinity similarly to the previous example.

### Example 3 Analysis
- **Input**: Color `1` is present in specific cells and color `3` in the center.
- **Output**: The color `1` fills the entire vertical column and horizontal row where it appears with some exceptions if the neighboring color also influences the spread.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves spreading certain colors to adjacent cells depending on their positions and neighboring non-zero values.

### Transformation Rule
The rule seems to be:
- If a number (color) exists at the edge of a cluster and has an adjacent cell (either vertically or horizontally) which is 0, it spreads to fill that adjacent cell.
- When two clusters of different numbers are close enough, they may prevent mutual spread, leaving some cells unchanged.

### Solving the Test Case
Let's apply this rule to the test case:

#### Test Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],
[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Applying the rule:
- The `2` on row 1, column 0 spreads to the left and right (columns 1 and 8).
- The `2` on row 3, columns 8 spreads to the left (column 7).
- The `6` on row 4, column 7 spreads down to column 7 on row 9.
- The `3`s on row 7, columns 3 and 4 spread horizontally to the left and right filling columns 2 and 4, respectively, and vertically up and down to rows 6 and 8.

So the transformed grid would be:

228f6490,"To find the transformation rule, let's look at the changes in the grids provided in the examples:

### Example 1:
- **Input:** A row with 6s adjacent to 5s had 6s replaced by 0s.
- **Observation:** In the row [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5], the 6s became 0s, but there were no 6s in that row, so other changes are needed to be observed.
- **Conclusion:** If a number (other than zero) is surrounded on both sides by a different number, it becomes zero.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** Adjacent 3s and 9s are present and need to be examined.
- **Output:** All single 3s that were surrounded by 5s turned into 0s, and all single 9s that were surrounded by 5s turned into 0s too.
- **Observation:** The middle 3 in the input [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9] was changed to an 8.
- **Conclusion:** If a number (other than zero) is surrounded on both sides by a different number, it gets replaced by a specific color. From the examples, it seems like the replacement color is determined based on the colors around it.

### Example 3:
- **Input:** There are 2s surrounded by 5s.
- **Output:** All such 2s turned into 0s except when they were directly surrounded by two 5s in which case they turned into 8s.
- **Observation:** This confirms the earlier conclusion that numbers surrounded by different numbers on both sides become zeros, except specific cases where they get replaced by another number.

### Analysis of Test Case:
Let's apply the identified rules to the test case:

1. Identify cells surrounded by different colors on both sides.
2. Replace those cells with zero if they don't fall into any special case.
3. Apply the special case rules observed in the examples.

#### Applying the Rules:
For each cell, if it is surrounded by different numbers on both sides, it will be replaced by zero. For special cases (like 2s surrounded by 5s), we replace them with an 8.

- Row 1 and Row 2: No replacements are needed here because no number meets the criteria to change.
- Row 3: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4] - The middle 0 surrounded by 5s on both sides should stay 0.
- Row 4: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0] - No replacements here.
- Row 5: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2] - The 2 at the end is not fully surrounded so it stays.
- Row 6: [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0] - The 2s are surrounded by 7 and 0, so they become 0.
- Row 7: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - No replacements here.
- Row 8: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] - No replacements here.
- Row 9: [0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5] - The middle 2 surrounded by 5s should be replaced by an 8.
- Row 10: [2, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] - The first 2 is not fully surrounded so it stays.

Applying these transformations, we get:

```python
[
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2],
[2, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4],

22eb0ac0,"To deduce the transformation rule, I'll analyze the provided examples.

In Example 1, we observe that the digit '4' in the input grid has been replaced with '4' repeated across the entire row in the output grid.
Similarly, in Example 2, the digit '8' in the input grid has been replaced by '8' across its whole row in the output grid.
In Example 3, no replacement happened as there was only one digit in each row and it was already spreading through the row.

The rule appears to be: Replace all zeros in a row with the original non-zero value if that non-zero value is at either end of the row. Otherwise, leave the row unchanged.

Applying this rule to our test case:

- Row 1 and Row 3 to Row 10 have no digits or only zeros, so they remain unchanged.
- Row 2 has a '4' at both ends, which would replace all zeros with '4'.
- Row 4 has a '3' at both ends, which would replace all zeros with '3'.
- Row 6 has a '2' and '9' at the ends, but the rule specifies replacing only if the same digit is at both ends; hence, it remains unchanged.
- Row 8 has '6' at both ends, so it would replace all zeros with '6'.

### Example 1 Analysis:
- **Input**: 
  - The '2' and '3' patterns are surrounded by zeros on all sides.
- **Output**: 
  - The '2' and '3' patterns remain the same, but all zeros directly above and below these patterns become zeros in a new row that is either immediately above or below the original pattern.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input**: 
  - The '3' patterns form a vertical line with '2' patterns surrounding them on two sides.
- **Output**: 
  - All zero rows that do not contain the '2' or '3' patterns are removed.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- **Input**: 
  - The '2' and '3' patterns form different shapes within the grid.
- **Output**: 
  - Only the rows containing '2' and '3' patterns are retained, while all other rows are replaced with zeros.

From these observations, we can deduce the following general rule:

**Transformation Rule:** 
Remove all rows that do not contain any non-zero elements ('2' or '3' in this context) and move the remaining non-zero patterns up to the top, filling the empty spaces at the bottom with zeros if necessary.

### Applying the Rule to Test Case:
For the test case provided:
- We have a pattern of '2' and '3' in rows 4 and 5, respectively.
- Rows 1, 2, and 3 are completely filled with zeros and should be removed.
- Row 6 is also completely filled with zeros and should be removed.
- Row 7 should be converted to a row filled with zeros.

Thus, the output for the test case will retain rows 4 and 5 at the top, and fill in a zero row at the bottom.

1. In each example, when a '1' appears in the input grid, an '8' appears around it in the output.
2. The '8' fills the immediate neighboring cells in all directions (up, down, left, right) but not diagonally.

Thus, the rule seems to be that whenever there is a '1' in the input grid, the surrounding cells (adjacent horizontally and vertically) are filled with '8' in the output grid, while leaving other cells unchanged.

Applying this rule to the test grid:
- We identify all '1's in the test grid.
- For each '1', we fill its immediate neighbors (horizontally and vertically) with '8'.
- All other cells remain '0'.

22233c11,"To understand the transformation rule between the input and output grids, let's analyze the changes in each example:

**Example 1 Analysis**
- In the input, there is a single '3' at positions (3,2) and (6,7).
- In the output, '8' appears at the top-left corner (0,2), and also in positions where the '3' was present plus the cells immediately surrounding them (up, down, left, right).

**Example 2 Analysis**
- In the input, there is a block of '3's starting from position (3,3) to (5,4).
- In the output, '8's appear surrounding the block including the first row (0,0-1), and the last column (7,8-9), which were directly influenced by the presence of the '3' block.

**Example 3 Analysis**
- In the input, there is a vertical line of '3's starting from position (3,3) to (4,3).
- In the output, '8's are placed in the cells surrounding the vertical line of '3's, but only one cell per row (left or right depending on the row).

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves:
- Replacing any '3' with '0'.
- Placing an '8' in all the cells directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of any '3', unless those cells are out of bounds.

Let's apply this rule to the Test Case:

The '3's in the test case form a symmetrical block starting from (2,2) to (7,6). We'll replace all '3's with '0', and fill '8's in all adjacent cells not out of bounds.

41e4d17e,"To determine the transformation rule from the given input and output examples, we need to analyze the changes made in the grids.

In both Example 1 and Example 2, the transformation seems to be focused on changing the numbers in the grid based on their surroundings. Specifically, when a '1' is surrounded by '8's on both sides horizontally or vertically, the '1's get changed to '6's. This can be observed in rows 4 through 7 of Example 1, and rows 4 through 12 of Example 2.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

According to the rule, in this pattern,
- All '1's which are surrounded by '8's horizontally or vertically will be turned into '6's.
- Rows where only central part has '1's will change these parts surrounded by '8's to '6's.

Let's apply this to the test case:

The first block of 1's in the test case (rows 2 to 6) will have its '1's transformed to '6's if they are surrounded by '8's. This gives us new rows:
- Row 2: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]
- Row 3: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]
- Row 4: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]
- Row 5: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]
- Row 6: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The second block of 1's in the test case (rows 10 to 14) follows the identical transformation:

- Row 10: [8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
- Row 11: [8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
- Row 12: [8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
- Row 13: [8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
- Row 14: [8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Rows 7, 8, and 9 remain unchanged as they contain no '1's that are completely surrounded by '8's.

So our final output should look like:

48d8fb45,"To figure out the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples.

The general pattern observed in each example is that the outputs are smaller matrices that represent the presence of the number 1 (in Example 1), 4 (in Example 2), and 3 (in Example 3) in the input grids. It seems these numbers are being condensed into small grids where each row corresponds to a 'slice' of the larger grid, and each value represents whether the number (1, 4, or 3) was present in the respective column of that slice.

In each test example, the output grid's size is 3x3.

Let's apply this rule to the provided test case where the target number is 3:

- Check columns for row 0 to 2 (first 'slice') and see if there's at least one 3 present.
- Check columns for row 3 to 5 (second 'slice').
- Check columns for row 6 to 8 (third 'slice').

For each slice, we'll fill the output grid with 3 if any of the rows in that slice contain a 3, otherwise we'll put 0.

First Slice (rows 0 to 2):
- Columns 0 to 2: no 3s.
- Columns 3 to 5: no 3s.
- Columns 6 to 9: contains a 3 in row 0.

Second Slice (rows 3 to 5):
- Columns 0 to 2: no 3s.
- Columns 3 to 5: no 3s.
- Columns 6 to 9: contains 3s in rows 3 and 4.

Third Slice (rows 6 to 8):
- Columns 0 to 2: no 3s.
- Columns 3 to 5: no 3s.
- Columns 6 to 9: contains 3s in rows 6, 7, and 8.

7ddcd7ec,"Upon examining the transformations from the input to the output in the provided examples, I noticed a pattern: the color (non-zero value) in the input appears in the upper left corner and then spreads out diagonally across the grid towards the lower right corner.

In Example 1, the '3' starts from row 2 column 3 and moves diagonally down-right.
In Example 2, the '4' starts from row 2 column 7 and moves diagonally down-right.
In Example 3, the '7' starts from row 3 column 7 and moves diagonally down-right.

Given the rules, we can apply the same logic to the test case. Here, the '8' appears first at row 4 column 5. It will spread out diagonally down-right.

760b3cac,"To discover the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes in the provided examples:

- In Example 1, a single 8 in the middle column of the first three rows has been duplicated on both sides.
- In Example 2, the pattern seems to be similar, but the duplication occurs not just horizontally, but also vertically when there are consecutive 8s in a row. Additionally, an existing 8 in a row above another 8 gets filled in with additional 8s in the columns where 8s appear below.
- In Example 3, the 8 in the first row gets duplicated to the neighboring positions horizontally and also fills out the blank space directly below it.

From these observations, we can infer that the rule involves spreading the number 8 outwards to adjacent cells horizontally if there is an 8 directly next to it or in the row directly above it (if there is another 8 directly below).

Applying this rule to the test case:

1. The 8 in [0][3] duplicates itself to [0][2] and [0][4].
2. The 8 in [0][5] duplicates itself to [0][4] and [0][6].
3. The 8 in [1][4] duplicates itself to [1][3] and [1][5], and since there's already an 8 in the row above [1][3] and [1][5], the 8 spreads into those positions as well.
4. The 8 in [2][3] duplicates itself to [2][2] and [2][4] because there are 8s directly below it in [3][3] and [4][3].

Therefore, the output should look like:

36d67576,"To find the transformation rule from the input grids to the output grids, we should compare the input and output grids in detail:

Upon close inspection of all training examples, we notice that the output grids have additional color placements compared to the input grids, specifically with numbers 1, 2, and 3 appearing where they did not before. The pattern seems to be:

- In Example 1, the number 3 appears right below any occurrence of the number 4, if there's no other number already present.
- In Example 2, the number 1 appears to the left and right of the 4, if there's no other number already present.
- In Example 3, the number 3 appears directly underneath any '2' at the end of a block of 4s, and the number 1 appears above any standalone '4' or at the beginning/end of a block of '4's, if there's no other number already present.

From these observations, we can conclude that the rule involves adding certain numbers (1, 2, 3) to specific positions around existing numbers. Specifically, it adds these numbers when:
- A '4' is found, a '3' is added right beneath it if there's no other number below.
- A '2' is found at the end of a block of '4's (or alone), a '1' is added both above and to the left and right (if no other numbers are present).
- A '4' is found at the start or end of a block, a '1' is added above it if no other number is already in that position.

Applying this rule to the test case:

The test case has some '4's and '2's which should trigger the transformation rules described above. We need to add '3's beneath '4's, and '1's around '2's and the ends of blocks of '4's. Let's apply the transformations step by step:

- There are '4's on row 3, column 2 and 4. Since there's no number right beneath them, we add '3's below them in row 4.
- The '2' in row 3, column 5, triggers the addition of '1's above and to its left and right if those positions weren't occupied in the first place.
- Row 4 has a block of '4's from columns 3 to 4, followed by another '4', column 12 sees an isolated '4'. Thus, '1's should be placed before and after the block ('4's) and directly above the isolated '4'.
- Row 6 contains a block of '4's from columns 4 to 12, ending with a '2'. So, '1's should be placed at the start of the block, immediately above the '2', and to the left and right of the '2'.

Now, let's put these rules into practice for the test case:

68b16354,"By examining the provided training examples, we can observe that the transformation rule applied is a rotation of the grid 180 degrees around its center. This means each row is flipped upside down so that the first row becomes the last row, the second row becomes the second-to-last row, and so on.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Input:

[3, 2, 8, 4, 1, 8, 4],
[1, 4, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]]
```

To rotate the grid 180 degrees, we reverse the order of rows and also reverse the order of elements within each row.

First, reversing the order of rows gives us:
```
[
[1, 4, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4],
[3, 2, 8, 4, 1, 8, 4],
[4, 1, 1, 1, 7, 8, 4],

[4, 4, 1, 1, 4, 3, 4],
[2, 8, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1]]
```

Then, we reverse the elements in each row to obtain the final result.

Therefore, the solution for the test case is:

After reviewing the pattern again, I noticed that my step of flipping elements within each row was incorrect in the context of a 180-degree rotation.

bb43febb,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the grid from input to output, let's analyze the given examples:

In Example 1, the rule seems to change any '5' surrounded vertically and horizontally by '5' and '0' to '2'. 
Looking at the row with index 3 (0-based), column 6 to 8, the cell at [3][6] had '5' surrounded by '5' to the left and right, and '0' above and below, so it turned into '2'.
The same applies to cells at [4][7], [5][7], and [6][4].

In Example 2, the same rule is applied.
At row 2 (0-based) and columns 2 to 6, there's a vertical strip of '5' surrounded by another vertical strip of '5' on the left and '0' on the right, which causes the second strip to transform into '2'.
Similarly, at row 8 (0-based) and columns 5 to 7, the '5' cells were changed to '2' because they were surrounded by '5' above and below, and '0' to the sides.

So, the rule is when a '5' has at least one '0' and at least one '5' adjacent to it (vertically or horizontally), it changes to '2'.

Applying that rule to the test case:

- In the first three rows, the '5' surrounded by '5' on the left and '0' on the right will all turn into '2'.
- In the fifth row, the '5' in the middle surrounded by '5' above and below and '0' on the right will turn into '2'.
- In the following rows (6th to 9th), the '5' in the middle surrounded by '5' both vertically and horizontally but also '0' on the right side will turn into '2'.

In Example 1:
- The first row [3, 3, 8] was transformed into [0, 0, 5].
- The second row [3, 7, 0] was transformed into [0, 7, 3].
- The third row [5, 0, 0] was transformed into [8, 3, 3].

The pattern here is that the numbers in the first row of the output grid are the numbers from the last row of the input grid read from right-to-left, and similarly, the numbers in the second row of the output grid are from the middle row of the input grid read from right-to-left. We can observe the same pattern for the subsequent rows.

In Example 2:
- The first row [5, 5, 2] was transformed into [0, 0, 0].
- The second row [1, 0, 0] was transformed into [0, 0, 1].
- The third row [0, 0, 0] was transformed into [2, 5, 5].

Again, we see the numbers in each row are being reversed and taken from the bottom-up order of the original grid.

Applying this transformation rule to the Test Case:
- The first row should be the reverse of the third row of the input grid: [0, 0, 4].

From the examples, we can deduce that the transformation involves replacing zeroes in each row of the input with the number from the previous row's last column. If a zero is in the first row, it remains as zero since there is no row above it.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Test Case:
Input:
```
[
[4, 0, 8],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 7, 0]
]
```

- In the first row, zeros are replaced with 8 (the last number in the row).
- In the second row, zeros are replaced with 8 (the last number in the first row).
- In the third row, zeros are replaced with 0 (the last number in the second row) except the first zero which gets replaced by 7 (the last number in the second row).

Thus, the transformed grid would be:
```
[
[4, 8, 8],
[8, 8, 8],

e179c5f4,"To determine the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's analyze them step by step:

In all three training examples, we notice that the transformation rule seems to change the value at coordinates where the original input grid changes from 0 to 1 (or vice versa). Specifically:

- Example 1 has a single '1' in the bottom row. The output grid mirrors this pattern with alternating 8s and 1s.
- Example 2 has a single '1' in the third column of its bottom row. The output grid places 1s in a diagonal pattern starting from this position, while the other positions get 8s.
- Example 3 has a single '1' in the fourth column of its bottom row. Similar to Example 2, the output grid follows this with a corresponding diamond-like arrangement of 1s.

From these observations, it appears that the output grid is generated by placing 1s around the position of the first '1' in the input grid, starting from the bottom row, and expanding upwards and downwards symmetrically. The rest of the positions are filled with 8s.

Applying this transformation rule to the Test case:

The Test case has a single '1' in the first column of its bottom row. So, we expect 1s arranged symmetrically around this position. We'll have 1s in the first column of the top and bottom rows, and 1s in the columns adjacent to the first one in the rows above and below the bottom row. 

So the output should look like:

1bfc4729,"To determine the transformation rule applied in the examples, let's analyze how the inputs are changed into their respective outputs.

In Example 1:
- There is a single non-zero value, '6', in row 3.
- The output has replaced all the zeros around it with '6' to form a border and filled the central rows with '6'.
- The single '7' in row 8 of the input has been transformed to fill its entire row and column.

In Example 2:
- There is a single '1' in row 3.
- The value '1' is used to fill a border around it and the central rows with '1'.
- The single '4' in row 8 has similarly been transformed to fill its entire row and column.

From these observations, we can infer that:
- If there is a color present in the middle rows, it fills up all adjacent cells horizontally and vertically to create a border, and also fills the central rows (if not already filled) with that color.
- Additionally, if any cell in a row contains a color, the entire row and column of that cell are filled with that color.

Using this rule, we'll apply the transformation to the Test case:

- In the Test case, there is a '2' in row 5, column 5.
- This would fill the cell horizontally and vertically to form a border of '2'.
- Rows 3, 4, and 6 would be filled with '2'.
- Similarly, there is an '8' in row 8, column 7.
- This '8' fills its row and column with '8'.
- Row 8 and column 7 would be filled with '8'.

Let's write out the final grid according to this rule.

From the input grid, we can see that the output grid contains only the numbers 8, 2, and 1. It appears that these numbers are collected from the bottom rows of the input grid where they first appear.

Again, the output grid contains only the numbers from the bottom of the input grid where they first appear. We also observe that the order of the numbers in the output seems to follow their appearance from left to right and top to bottom.

### Test Case Solution:
For the test case input, we need to find the first occurrence of each number from the bottom up and place them in the order they appear in the output grid. This means:
- Starting from the bottom row, we find the first 6, 8, 1, and 3 from left to right.
- Each number appears exactly once.
- Since the test case does not have any number appearing more than once in the output (as per the rules observed), the output should collect these numbers into the smallest possible square.

Let's do this step-by-step:
1. The first 6 appears at (2, 3).
2. The first 8 appears at (2, 10) and (2, 11).
3. The first 1 appears at (7, 6) and (7, 7).
4. The first 3 appears at (10, 3).

Thus, the output grid should be:
```
[
[6, 8, 8, 1],
[6, 1, 1, 3],
[3, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

In this arrangement, the numbers are placed in the order they are found, and the output fits into a 4x4 grid.

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Each non-zero cell in the input grid is expanded into a square block of the same color in the output grid, with the size of the block being 2x2.

In Example 2:
Input:
```
[[0, 4, 0],
 [0, 0, 8],
 [6, 0, 0]]
```
Output:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],

 [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Again, each non-zero cell is expanded into a square block of the same color, but now the size of the blocks is larger. The block sizes appear consistent at a 3x3 size for the given numbers 4, 6, and 8.

In Example 3:
Input:

[[0, 6, 9],
 [3, 0, 2],
 [0, 7, 0]]

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

We can see that the output is still generated by expanding non-zero cells into blocks, where the size of these blocks increases as the number of rows or columns increases. Each non-zero value in the input creates a square block of the same value in the output, which has sides equal to its row index plus one and column index plus one.

Given this pattern, let's apply the rule to the test input.

Test Input:
```
[[1, 0, 0],
 [0, 9, 6],
 [8, 0, 0]]
```

Let's expand each non-zero cell in the test input into a block based on the rule described above:
- For `1` in row 0, column 0: The block is 1x1.
- For `9` in row 1, column 1: The block is 2x2.
- For `6` in row 1, column 2: The block is 2x1.
- For `8` in row 2, column 0: The block is 3x1.

Putting it all together, we get:

From Example 1:
- The input has a '1' at positions (4,1) and (4,7).
- In the output, there is a '3' filling the cells directly above, below, left, and right of each '1', while the original '1's remain unchanged.
  
From Example 2:
- The input has '1's at positions (3,3) and (8,3).
- Similar to Example 1, the output has '3's filling the cells adjacent to these '1's, including vertically and horizontally but not diagonally.

Based on this observation, we see that the rule appears to be: 
- When a '1' is present in a cell, the numbers '3' are filled in all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).

Applying this rule to the test case:
- There is a '1' at positions (3,3) and (3,11) in the test case.

Therefore, the output should add '3's to all cells adjacent to these '1's.

d687bc17,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids, let's analyze each training example:

1. In Example 1, we observe that the color 4 was propagated horizontally in the first row and vertically in the second column, while the color 7 was only retained in its initial position.
2. In Example 2, the color 1 was propagated vertically from the second to the third row and horizontally in the 5th column. The color 7 was propagated vertically across all rows where it appeared.
3. In Example 3, the color 6 was propagated horizontally in the first row, and the color 8 was propagated vertically in the last column. The color 3 was only retained where it already existed.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves propagating colors horizontally and vertically from their initial positions, but only if they have adjacent cells with the same color. This propagation stops at boundaries or when different colors meet.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- We will start from the edges (where non-zero numbers exist) and propagate those colors inward.

For the test case, the colors that need attention are:
- Color 4 in the first row needs to propagate horizontally.
- Color 1 in the second row needs to propagate horizontally and vertically (upwards).
- Color 2 in the second row needs to propagate horizontally.
- Colors 8 and 1 in the last two columns need to propagate vertically.
- Colors 6, 7, and 4 in the middle rows need to propagate vertically or horizontally if possible.

Step-by-step transformation:
- Propagate 4s on the first row to fill the entire row between 0s.
- Propagate 1s vertically upwards from the second row to fill the cells above them up to the first row.
- Propagate 2s horizontally on the second row to fill the cells right until the boundary or until another color appears. 
- Propagate 8s vertically downwards from the last column starting from the second row.
- Propagate 1s vertically downwards from the last column starting from the second row.
- Propagate 6s and 7s vertically downwards where they are located.

b94a9452,"To solve the given problem, let's analyze the provided examples step-by-step to understand the transformation rule.

Firstly, notice the structure of the input and output grids. Each output grid contains only part of the information from the corresponding input grid, specifically focusing on the smallest rectangle that encompasses all the non-zero elements. This rectangle is trimmed from the edges where there are zero-valued cells.

For Example 1:
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Output:
```
[
[4, 4, 4, 4],
[4, 2, 2, 4],
[4, 2, 2, 4],
[4, 4, 4, 4]]
```
The smallest rectangle containing non-zero elements in the input is the one centered around the middle rows and columns with the numbers 2 and 4. It is trimmed down to a 4x4 grid, where the outer layer (cells adjacent to the zeros) of the original non-zero rectangle are replaced with the value present at those edges.

For Example 2:
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Output:
```
[
[3, 3, 3],
[3, 1, 3],
[3, 3, 3]]
```
Again, observe the smallest rectangle which includes the numbers 1 and 3, and is trimmed into a 3x3 grid. The outer layer of this smaller rectangle is filled with the number 3.

For Example 3:
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Output:
```
[
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
[6, 4, 4, 4, 6],
[6, 4, 6, 4, 6],
[6, 4, 4, 4, 6],
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]
```
Notice the smallest rectangle including numbers 4 and 6 has been trimmed to a 5x5 grid, and its outer layer is replaced with the number 6.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
The smallest rectangle containing the non-zero elements is a 5x2 rectangle with the numbers 3 and 8. We trim this to a 3x2 grid by removing the extra zeros.

Then we replace the outer layer with the surrounding non-zero color. In this case, the surrounding non-zero color is 3.

So, the output should be:
```
[
[3, 3],
[3, 8, 8],
[3, 3]]
```

6430c8c4,"To determine the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs.

In all the examples, the first few rows contain the number 7. The transformation seems to be based on the presence of 7s in those rows.

- If there are four 7s in the first row, the output for that row will have zeros everywhere.
- If there are three 7s in the first row, the output will have one zero and two threes, where the threes appear in the positions where there weren't 7s in the input.
- If there are two 7s in the first row, the output will have two zeros and two threes, alternating with the position of the 7s.
- If there is only one 7 in the first row, the output will have three zeros and one three where the 7 was.
- The second row follows a similar pattern based on the number of 7s in it.
- Rows below the first few rows seem to get simplified in the output to just zeros or certain patterns of zeros and threes depending on the configuration of 7s in the preceding rows.
- The fourth row in the output usually reflects the number of 7s in the third row of the input, but inverted in terms of zeros and threes placement compared to the first two rows.
- All remaining rows after the first few are entirely zeros in the output, except the fourth row which gets populated based on patterns above.

For the test case:

Input rows have different configurations of 7s:
- First row has four 7s, so according to the observed pattern, the output for the first row should be all zeros.
- Second row has three 7s, so it should have one zero and two threes. Since the single non-7 is in the fourth position, the first three positions will become 3s and the fourth 0.
- Third row has one 7, so it will have three zeros and one three in its output; the three should replace the 7's position, and the rest should be zeros.
- Fourth row will reflect the pattern based on the third row, hence zeros except in the position where there was a 7, making it a three.
- All other remaining input rows are ignored, and their corresponding output rows are filled with zeros.

Thus, the output for the test case should look like this:

Answer: ```
[[0, 0, 0, 0],
 [3, 3, 3, 0],

46442a0e,"To determine the transformation rule that converts the input grids into the output grids, let's analyze each training example in detail:

### Example 1:
Input:
```
[
 [8, 6],
 [6, 8]
]
```
Output:
```
[
 [8, 6, 6, 8],
 [6, 8, 8, 6],
 [6, 8, 8, 6],
 [8, 6, 6, 8]
]
```
- The input is a 2x2 grid.
- The resulting output is a 4x4 grid.

The transformation seems to involve mirroring the grid both horizontally and vertically and then combining it with the original grid, essentially making a grid that looks like:
```
[
 [a, b, b, a],
 [b, a, a, b],
 [b, a, a, b],
 [a, b, b, a]
]
```
where `a` and `b` are the elements of the original 2x2 grid.

### Example 2:
Input:
```
[
 [7, 7, 8],
 [7, 7, 8],
 [8, 8, 8]
]
```
Output:
```
[
 [7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 7],
 [7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 7],
 [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
 [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
 [7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 7],
 [7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 7]
]
```
- The input is a 3x3 grid.
- The resulting output is a 6x6 grid.

The output maintains a pattern where each row and column of the original grid is mirrored across its center and then combined with the original rows and columns. This results in the grid being extended symmetrically on both axes.

### Example 3:
Input:
```
[
 [6, 9, 9],
 [6, 4, 4],
 [6, 4, 4]]
```
Output:
```
[
 [6, 9, 9, 6, 6, 6],
 [6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9],
 [6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9],
 [9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6],
 [9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6],
 [6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 6]
]
```
- The input is a 3x3 grid.
- The resulting output is a 6x6 grid.

Again, we see the mirrored extension pattern where the output grid is created by mirroring both horizontally and vertically and adding the mirrored versions to the original grid.

### Test Case
Given the input:
```
[
 [1, 4, 1],
 [4, 9, 4],
 [9, 1, 9]
]
```

We should follow the same transformation rule used in the previous examples, which involves creating a mirrored version of the grid along both the horizontal and vertical axes, and then appending these mirrored versions to the original grid.

Let's apply the rule:

1. Mirror the grid horizontally (rows).
2. Mirror the grid vertically (columns).
3. Combine the grid with its horizontal mirror image on the right.
4. Append the vertical mirror image below the combined grid.

So,
Horizontal and vertical mirrors of the input:
```
Horizontal mirror:
[
 [1, 4, 1],
 [4, 9, 4],
 [9, 1, 9]
]

Vertical mirror:
[
 [1, 4, 1],
 [4, 9, 4],
 [9, 1, 9]
]
```
Because in this particular case, the input grid is symmetrical along both axes. Therefore, the result will be the grid repeated twice in all directions:
```
[
 [1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1],
 [4, 9, 4, 4, 9, 4],
 [1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1],
 [4, 9, 4, 4, 9, 4],
 [1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1],
 [4, 9, 4, 4, 9, 4]

444801d8,"To solve the puzzle, let's analyze the transformation rule applied in the provided examples:

In Example 1, the color '2' appears at the center of the rectangle formed by '1's. Each '1' that borders a '2' or is part of the same row or column within the rectangle gets replaced by '2'.

In Example 2, the same principle applies but there are two different regions of interest: one centered around '2' and another around '3'. The '3' replaces all surrounding '1's in a similar rectangle pattern.

In Example 3, the pattern continues with colors '6' and '8', replacing all neighboring '1's within their respective rectangles.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:
- If any value other than '0' is surrounded completely by '1's in a horizontal or vertical line, then all '1's that surround or are part of the rectangle containing that value get replaced by that value.

Let's apply the rule to the test case:
- We have '4' at the center of a rectangle formed by '1's.
- We have '7' similarly at the center of another rectangle of '1's.

Therefore, we transform the grid accordingly:

- The 5th row has all 8s, so every value in that row becomes 8.
- All other non-zero rows have some combination of 0 and 8, which is replaced with 5 and 8 respectively, except for the last column which remains unchanged if there was an 8 in any previous row at that position.

- The 6th row has all 1s, so every value in that row becomes 1.
- For the rows before the 6th row, wherever there is a 0, it becomes 5, unless there is a 1 above or below that position, in which case it fills up to those positions.
- The columns containing 1s have been filled with 1s starting from the row where the first 1 appears.

```

From Example 3, we can see:
- The 4th row has all 2s, so every value in that row becomes 2.
- For all other rows, wherever there is zero, it changes to 5 unless there is a 2 above or below that position, in which case it will change to 2 up to that point.

### Test Case

```

Following the rule identified, the solution would be:
- The 1st and 10th rows both contain all 4s, so they become completely filled with 4s.
- Other rows fill up to 4 with 5s, unless they contain another 4 directly above or below, in which case those positions also become 4s.

Therefore, the output for the test case should be:

fcc82909,"To identify the transformation rule applied from input to output, let's analyze each training example:

### Example 1 Analysis:
- **Input** has two rows with colors `6` and `9`.
- **Output** adds a row of `3`s above and below each color block.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input** has a color block consisting of `4`, `8`, `9`, and `2`.
- **Output** surrounds each block of these colors with `3`s.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- **Input** has two rows with colors `6` and `7`, and a single `7` and `6`.
- **Output** adds `3`s around each block of these colors.

From these examples, we can deduce that the rule:
- Inserts a row of `3`s just above and just below any non-zero blocks in the input grid.
- If a non-zero value is directly adjacent to an existing `3`, the `3` remains in those positions.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:
- The non-zero blocks in the test case occur at positions:
    - Row 1: `[1, 1]`, `[2, 9]`
    - Row 2: `[2, 1]`, `[1, 6]`
    - Row 3: `[4, 7]`
    - Row 4: `[8, 4]`

Given this observation, let's create the output grid accordingly:
1. Keep the original non-zero blocks.
2. Add rows of `3`s above and below each non-zero block.
3. Adjust the `3`s if they are in direct adjacency to ensure no gaps are left unaccounted.

Let's construct the solution step-by-step:

- Row 1: `[1, 1]` and `[2, 9]` blocks should have `3`s added above and below.
- Row 2: `[2, 1]` and `[1, 6]` blocks should have `3`s added above and below.
- Row 3: `[4, 7]` block should have `3`s added above and below.
- Row 4: `[8, 4]` block should have `3`s added above and below.

Since there is no overlap or adjacency issues between different blocks, we simply add `3`s as identified:

44f52bb0,"To determine the rule that transforms the input grids into their respective outputs, let's analyze the examples provided:

- In Example 1, the input grid contains a pattern where 2s and 0s alternate around the central column and row. The result is a single-color grid with the color 1.
- Example 2 shows a tilted pattern (2, 0, 0) repeated twice vertically, with a single 2 in the middle. Again, the output is a single-color grid with the color 7.
- Example 3 repeats the pattern from Example 1 in a larger scale, but still results in a single-color grid with the color 1. 
- Example 4 has only the central row being a pattern similar to Example 1, yet the output is a single-color grid with the color 1.
- Example 5 and 6 have patterns that extend vertically from a central point and also result in a single-color grid with the color 7.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is based on symmetry around the center. If the input grid is symmetric both horizontally and vertically around its center, then the output is a single-color grid with the number 1. If there is vertical symmetry with respect to the central column but not horizontal symmetry around the center, or if there is symmetry extending vertically but not horizontal across all rows, then the output is a single-color grid with the number 7.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:
The Test Case is:
[
[2, 0, 2],
[2, 2, 2],
[2, 0, 2]]

We see that the grid has perfect symmetry around its vertical center (each column mirrored with respect to the second column), and symmetry extending vertically but not horizontally around the center (the top and bottom rows mirror each other, and the middle row is completely filled with 2s).

Because it meets the criteria of vertical symmetry with respect to the center and symmetry extending vertically without complete horizontal symmetry around the center, the solution should be:

ded97339,"Let's break down the transformation rule based on the provided examples:

In Example 1, we see that when there is an '8' in the input grid, it appears in the output grid with all the cells directly horizontally adjacent filled with '8' as well. This applies to the '8' at positions (4, 8), (7, 5), and (9, 6) in the input grid, which in the output grid have their direct horizontal neighbors filled with '8'.

Following the same pattern in Example 2, the '8' at positions (1, 8) and (7, 6) and (7, 9) are similarly extended to fill their entire row segments where they occur.

In Example 3, the '8's at various positions extend horizontally as well, following the same pattern.

From these observations, the rule seems clear: any '8' in a cell extends itself horizontally to fill the entire row segment it occurs in, up to the nearest '0' or edge of the row.

Applying this rule to the test case:

ff28f65a,"Let's analyze the provided training examples to find the transformation rule:

- In Example 1, the top two rows both contain color `2`. The resulting output shows that only the first row of the output grid has a `1` in the positions where `2` was found.
- In Example 2, the middle two rows have color `2` in their second and third columns. The output grid contains a `1` at the start and end of the grid, indicating presence of `2` in the input grid at the corresponding positions.
- In Example 3, the pattern of `2` appears twice, once from rows 2 to 3 and once in rows 4 to 5. The output reflects `1` in the first and third position of the first row.
- In Example 4, similar to Example 2, there are blocks of `2` in the middle and right side of the grid, with the output showing a `1` where these blocks begin and end along the horizontal axis.
- In Example 5, `2` appears in a block spanning across rows 2 to 3. The output correctly reflects `2`'s presence with `1`'s in the first row's first and last column.
- In Example 6, there are several blocks of `2`, and in the output, `1`s appear in the first and third columns, while a `1` in the middle column reflects the second block of `2`.
- In Example 7, similar to Example 6, but now there are three distinct blocks of `2` horizontally, which results in three `1`s in the first row of the output grid.
- In Example 8, the output correctly identifies the presence of the first block of `2` starting on the left in the top two rows, and another block starting from the third column in the fourth row.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:

- Identify all horizontal blocks of color `2` in the input grid.
- Create an output grid of size 3 x N where N is the number of distinct horizontal blocks of `2` found in the input grid.
- For each block of `2` found in the input, place a `1` in the first row of the output grid in the column that corresponds to the start and end of such a block.
- If a block spans more than one starting or ending column, the `1` should be placed in the corresponding columns in the output grid.

The rule places a `1` in the first row of the output grid to indicate the presence of a block of `2` in the input grid, regardless of the block's exact span. It also reduces the height of the grid to 3 rows and keeps the width equivalent to the input grid's width.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:

- We see that color `2` appears in two distinct blocks in the Test Input grid: one starting from the 4th column and extending to the 5th column across the top two rows, and another starting from the 3rd column and extending to the 5th column in the rows below.

Thus, the output should be:

- For smaller isolated 5s segments that are not directly connected to the larger ones vertically, they stay as 5 but any space below them is filled with '6' if they have another 5 directly below.

### Example 2:
- Similar to Example 1, the vertical lines of 5s get filled with '8' or '7', starting from the top with '8'.
- Smaller isolated segments also see their immediate lower cells filled with '6' if they form a direct vertical connection.

### Example 3:
- Consecutive vertical line segments of 5s fill up with '8' or '7' in the same pattern as before.
- For smaller isolated 5s segments that don't connect vertically with others, the cells below them that touch other 5s horizontally are filled with '7'.

### Patterns observed:
- When there's a vertical line of 5s, the rule fills it up with '8' or '7', depending on the starting point.
- When a single 5 is surrounded by 0s but connected vertically to another 5 below it, the cell below gets '6'.
- Horizontally connected 5s that are isolated vertically do not affect non-connected cells below them unless they are part of a vertical line.

### Applying the observed rules to the Test Case:
Let's apply these observations to the test case:

- The top two rows and the first column of the third row form a vertical segment of 5s. This segment would be filled in as follows:
  - Top row: Unchanged
  - Second row: Unchanged
  - Third row: 5 -> 8
  - Fourth row: 5 -> 7
  - Fifth row: 5 -> 8
  - Sixth row: 5 -> 7
  - Seventh row: Unchanged

- The middle section from rows 4 to 6 has a vertical segment of 5s that starts at an isolated position and connects to another 5 below in the same column. These should be filled with '6' immediately below each individual 5.

The rest of the 5s remain unchanged because they do not form a continuous vertical line or they are not connected to another 5 vertically.

Putting this all together:

a1570a43,"To discern the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids, let's analyze the pattern observed in the provided examples.

In Example 1, it seems that the middle rows and columns with the color '2' are effectively shifted diagonally towards the center, while maintaining any '3' at the edge in their respective positions.

In Example 2, we notice that colors '2' are moved towards the diagonal center, while colors '3' remain unchanged when they're at the edges.

In Example 3, we can see a similar transformation where '2's form a new diagonal pattern centered within the grid.

In Example 4, there's again a centralization of the '2's into a more pronounced diagonal shape, leaving other elements untouched if they're not part of this central movement.

Based on these observations, it appears that the transformation rule involves:
1. Identifying all '2's.
2. Moving them to the closest position along the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) without overlapping.
3. Keeping all other numbers in their original positions unless displaced by the moving '2's.

For the test case, we'll apply the same logic:
- Identify the '2's and move them along the diagonal.
- Any '3's at the edges will stay in place, and any other '0's will not change unless necessary due to the movement of '2's.

The test case grid contains '2's forming a diagonal line and '3's in the outermost layer. The '2's already form a diagonal shape, so no movement of '2's should occur here. The '0's fill the rest of the space and do not need adjustment.

From Example 1:
Input grid has 3, 3, 8, 2 in certain patterns, and the output lists only the unique color numbers found in the input grid in descending order of their first appearance. In this case, 3 appears first, followed by 2, then 8.

From Example 2:
Similarly, the input grid contains 1, 7, 2. The output lists these numbers in descending order based on their first appearance, with 1 coming first, then 7, and finally 2.

From Example 3:
The input grid has 4, 2, 1 appearing in certain patterns. The output again lists them in descending order of their first appearance.

In all examples, the output consists of a list of the unique colors present in the grid, ordered from the largest number first to the smallest number last, considering the first occurrence of each unique color number in the input grid.

For the Test Case:
- We have the colors 3, 1, 6 appearing in the grid.
- Based on their first appearances, 3 comes first, followed by 1, and then 6.

Therefore, we can conclude that the output should be a list with these colors, in the order of their first appearance:

The pattern here seems to involve the '7' from the input being surrounded or replaced with '2's in the output. Specifically, if there's a '7' in the input, the surrounding cells (horizontally and vertically adjacent) become '2' in the output.

In this example, the '8' in the input is surrounded by '6's in the output. This confirms the rule that when a specific color (in this case, '7' and '8') appears in the input, the surrounding cells get filled with another color ('2' for '7', '6' for '8').

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
Given the test case:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

We can see that '3's appear in the test case. Based on the patterns observed in the examples, '3' should have its surrounding cells filled with '4' in the output.

Thus, the transformation involves changing any '3' to '4', and filling the horizontally and vertically adjacent cells of any '3' with '4'. There is no mention of '4' transforming into any other number, so we'll leave those unchanged.

The output for the test case will be:

In Example 1, the input grid has 3 rows and 9 columns while the output grid has 3 rows and 3 columns. For each row in the input, every third value is kept, and the rest are discarded.
Similarly, in Example 2, the input grid has 4 rows and 12 columns while the output grid has 4 rows and 4 columns. For each row in the input, every fourth value is kept, and the rest are discarded.
Finally, Example 3 features an input grid with 2 rows and 8 columns and an output grid having 2 rows and 4 columns. Again, every second value in each row of the input is kept in the output.

Thus, the transformation rule appears to be: take the first value in each row and keep every nth value from there on, where n is the number of columns divided by the number of columns in the output grid.

Given the test case has 5 rows and 15 columns, we expect the output grid to have 5 rows and 5 columns. We need to keep every 3rd value from each row (since 15/5 = 3).

Let's apply this to the test case:
Input:
```

[1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0]

We'll keep the following values:
- First row: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4]

Observing these patterns, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves changing the number 0 to 3 or 4, and the number 5 to 2 or 4 in a structured manner.

The key rule seems to be based on the position of the number 5 relative to the 0s in the row and column. Wherever there is a single 5 surrounded by 0s, the 5 in the output becomes 4. When all the elements in a row or column are either 0 or 5, the corresponding row or column in the output becomes filled with the smallest surrounding value among the possible outputs, which is 3 for rows/columns filled only with 0s and 4 for rows/columns mixed with 0s and 5s. 

For the Test Case, the input is:
```
[0, 0, 5]
[5, 0, 0]
[0, 5, 0]
```

The first row has a 5 at the end, and 0s in the other positions, so it should become [3, 3, 4].
The second row starts with a 5, followed by 0s, so it should become [4, 3, 3].
The third row has a 5 in the middle, flanked by 0s, so it should become [3, 4, 3].

Therefore, the output should be:
```
[3, 3, 4]
[4, 3, 3]
[3, 4, 3]
```

1b60fb0c,"To determine the transformation rule, I'll examine the differences between the input and output grids in the provided examples.

**Example 1 Input and Output Analysis:**
- In the output grid, all areas where there are three consecutive '1's in the 5th row (starting from the left) become '2'.
- This pattern also occurs similarly in rows 6 and 7, but only where they overlap with the 5th row horizontally ('1' columns).

**Example 2 Input and Output Analysis:**
- Here, every time there are five consecutive '1's in any horizontal line, those positions are changed to '2'.
- Additionally, the areas where the '1's are spread vertically and form a column are also replaced by '2' up to 4 cells high if they directly connect horizontally to the five '1's pattern.

**Example 3 Input and Output Analysis:**
- Again, when there are five consecutive '1's in any horizontal or vertical line, those positions are marked with '2'.
- However, now we can observe that even if there's a single break in the horizontal sequence of '1's, the vertical connections still get filled with '2'.

From these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:
- Any horizontal segment of at least five consecutive '1's should have the outer two positions in that segment changed to '2', while keeping the middle '1's unchanged.
- Any vertical segments of '1's connected directly to the horizontal five '1's segment should extend the '2's up to four positions vertically.

Applying the rule to the Test Case:

The fifth row has a continuous segment of '1's: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
- This should turn the first and last '1' in this segment into '2': [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2].

Rows 3, 4, 6, and 8 contain '1's that connect vertically to this row's segment of '1's.
- These vertical connections should be marked with '2' up to four cells high if they connect to the five ‘1’s pattern.

So the result after applying the transformation rule would be:

63613498,"To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in each training example.

In Example 1:
- The number 6 in the 6th row was changed to 5.
- The number 6 in the 7th row was changed to 5.
- The number 9 in the 8th row was changed to 5.
- The number 9 in the 9th row was changed to 5.

In Example 2:
- The number 6 in the 7th row was changed to 5.
- The number 9 in the 8th row was changed to 5.
- The number 9 in the 9th row was changed to 5.

In Example 3:
- The number 1 in the 7th row was changed to 5.
- The number 1 in the 8th row was changed to 5.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves changing all occurrences of certain numbers to the number 5. In the cases provided, the numbers that get transformed into 5 are 6, 8, 9, and 1.

To apply this transformation rule to the test case:
- We need to change all instances of the numbers 6, 8, 9, and 1 into the number 5.
  
Let's do this:

Input

Applying the transformation rule:
- All 6s become 5s.
- All 8s become 5s.
- All 9s become 5s.
- All 1s become 5s.

Since there are no 1s and 9s in the test case, only the 6s and 8s are transformed into 5s.

b8cdaf2b,"To identify the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's first analyze the changes in the provided examples:

- In Example 1, the number '2' is surrounded by '0's, so the adjacent cells on its sides are changed to '4'.
- In Example 2, there's a vertical line of '8's with '0's above and below. The cells directly above the middle of this vertical line become '3', while the cells directly right and left become '3' too.
- In Example 3, we see a horizontal line of '6's, with '0's on both sides. The cell directly above the middle of this horizontal line becomes '1', and the cells directly to the right and left of that top '1' also become '1'.
- In Example 4, there's a combination of vertical and horizontal lines, with '2's forming a vertical line and '4's forming a horizontal line. The cells directly above and below the middle of the '2's vertical line are '4', and the cells directly right and left of the middle of the '4's horizontal line are '4'.

From these observations, we can infer the following rules:

1. If there's a single number (like '2' or '4') surrounded by '0's in the input grid, the adjacent cells ('0's) are changed to the number itself in the output grid.
2. For continuous sequences of numbers (horizontal or vertical lines), the change is made in the cells surrounding the sequence but only if they are '0's. Specifically:
   - For a vertical line, the cells directly above and below the middle of the line are filled with the number from the line.
   - For a horizontal line, the cells directly to the left and right of the middle of the line are filled with the number from the line.

Applying this rule to the test case, we have a horizontal line of '8's in the middle row and a vertical line of '2's on the far-right column. We'll change the cells around these lines according to the observed pattern.

694f12f3,"To determine the transformation rule, I'll compare the input and output grids in the training examples:

In Example 1:
- The central 4 blocks ('4' in row index 3 and column index 2-4) became '1'.
- The outer edges of the central '4' block area ('4' in row index 7 and column index 3-7) became '2'.

In Example 2:
- The middle 2 blocks ('4' in row index 3 and column index 2-5) became '2'.
- The outer edges of the central '4' block area ('4' in row index 4 and column index 2-6) and ('4' in row index 8 and column index 2-6) became '1'.

Based on these observations, a possible transformation rule could involve changing the innermost blocks to a new color (say '1') while the next layer of blocks around them changes to another new color (say '2'). This transformation only affects continuous blocks of '4's that are surrounded by '0's.

For the Test Case:
The input starts with a large block of '4's in rows 1-4, columns 1-6, followed by an isolated horizontal line of '4's at the bottom.

Applying the transformation rule we identified:
- The large block's inner part (rows 2-3, columns 2-5) would change to '1':

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]

- Then the immediate outer block of the large block (rows 1-4, columns 1, 7-6) changes to '2':

- In Example 1, we see that wherever there was a 4 or 3 in the input, those positions were replaced by 6s in the output, with some padding of zeros.
- In Example 2, again 4s and 3s are converted into 6s but also notice that the second row retains its pattern without changing the zero in the middle.
- Example 3 shows that only the places where 4 and 3 occur are changed to 6. The presence of zeros does not affect the conversion of other digits to 6.
- Example 4 follows the same pattern, converting 4s and 3s to 6s while maintaining zeros.
- In Example 5, we once more observe that all occurrences of 4 and 3 become 6, and zeros stay as they are.

From these observations, we can conclude the transformation rule:

**Rule:** Replace all instances of the number 4 and the number 3 in the input grid with the number 6 in the output grid. Zeros remain unchanged, and the structure of the grid is preserved.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

2. In Example 2, all '5's are replaced by '1's and '2's based on their positions; the leftmost '5's become '1' while the rightmost '5's turn into '2'.
3. In Example 3, similar to Example 2, '5' is replaced by different values ('1' or '2') depending on their location within the grid, with the rule that the left side '5's turn into '1' and the right side '5's turn into '2'.

The rule seems to be:
- All '5's are replaced with '1' if they are on the left half of the grid (when considering the vertical axis) and '2' if they are on the right half.

Now we apply this rule to the test case provided:

Upon scrutinizing the data, we can observe that the number '5' in the inputs is being replaced by '3' in the outputs, except when '5' is the only non-zero value in its row or column. In this latter scenario, '5' remains unchanged.

Let's apply this reasoning to the test case:

1. Examine each cell in the test case grid.
2. Replace all occurrences of '5' with '3', unless it is the only non-zero value in its row or column.

Following these steps:

- First row has a pattern of [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0]
    - Only the first '5' should remain unchanged because it is the sole non-zero value in its column.
    - All other '5's should be changed to '3'.
- Second row has a pattern of [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0].
    - The first '5' should remain unchanged because it is the sole non-zero value in its column.
    - All other '5's should be changed to '3'.
- Third row has a pattern of [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5].
    - Each '5' in the third row seems to be surrounded by zeros, which means that none of them are the sole non-zero value in their columns. Therefore, they should all be converted to '3'.

The resulting grid after applying the transformation rule would be:

In all three training examples, the rule seems to involve mirroring or duplicating non-zero elements in certain sections.

For Example 1:
- The first four rows have their non-zero elements duplicated to the right.
- The fifth row remains unchanged but the sixth to eighth rows duplicate their non-zero elements to the right.
- The ninth row has its non-zero elements duplicated to the right.

For Example 2:
- The structure follows the same pattern as Example 1, with the non-zero elements of the first three rows being mirrored to the right, followed by the rest of the rows having their non-zero elements similarly mirrored.

For Example 3:
- The process continues to mirror non-zero elements in the same manner as observed in Examples 1 and 2.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:
The test case also seems to follow the same duplication (mirroring) pattern as mentioned above.

93b581b8,"To determine the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's analyze the changes from each input to its corresponding output.

In Example 1, the color '9' in the center of the input grid remains unchanged in the output grid. However, the colors directly adjacent to '9' (which are '3' and '7') are mirrored around '9', filling the space above and below it.

Example 2 shows similar behavior with the numbers '2', '1', '4', and '6'. The numbers '2' and '1' at the center are surrounded by '4' on one side and '6' on the other, and these numbers get reflected vertically around the center pair.

Example 3 exhibits a consistent pattern again with numbers '3', '6', '5', and '2' mirroring each other in the same way as seen in previous examples.

From the analysis, the transformation appears to:

1. Identify all non-zero elements in the central row(s) and column(s).
2. Reflect the non-zero elements symmetrically around their positions but only fill in the areas beyond the central line, leaving the original central non-zero elements untouched.
3. If there are any empty rows or columns above or below the central row with non-zero elements, fill them with the reflected pattern accordingly.

Therefore, the rule seems to involve mirroring the non-zero elements around their central position and populating the surrounding regions based on that reflection. 

Applying this rule to the Test Case:
- The central non-zero elements are '3' and '1' (in the 4th row) and '2' and '5' (in the 5th row).
- We'll mirror '1' and '3' from the 4th row upwards, and '2' and '5' from the 5th row upwards and downwards.

Let's apply the transformation rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Following the identified pattern, we'll reflect the values symmetrically:
```
[

[1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3],

150deff5,"To figure out the transformation rule applied in the examples, I'll analyze the changes row by row:

In Example 1:
- The first instance of a group of 5s (two 5s) got changed to two 8s and one 2.
- Following instances of groups of 5s (three or more) got transformed into a 2 at the start and an 8 at the end, with the middle elements remaining as 5s.

In Example 2:
- Similar rule applies here. For the initial group of five 5s, two 8s and three 2s are placed.
- For the smaller groups of 5s that follow, they got transformed into a starting 2 and ending 8 while keeping the rest as 5s.

In Example 3:
- The rule holds true for this example as well. Any group of 5s gets its first element turned into 2 and last element turned into 8, while all other elements remain 5s.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:
- We can see the first row has two groups of 5s. The first group (first two 5s) would become [8, 8, 2] but since there are only two 5s, we just replace them with [2, 8].
- The second row has a group of two 5s replaced with [2, 8].
- The third row has a group of six 5s which will transform into [2, 5, 5, 5, 8].
- The fourth and subsequent rows contain similar patterns of 5s that can be similarly transformed.

3e980e27,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples step-by-step.

In Example 1, it looks like the color 2 in row 4 and column 5, and color 1 in row 4 and columns 6-7, have been spread out below them in the output. Similarly, the color 2 in row 9 and column 7, and color 1 in row 9 and columns 8-9, have also been spread out below them.

In Example 2, we observe that colors 2 and 4 in row 8 and column 7 have been mirrored downwards into row 8 and column 10, and the colors 3 and 4 in row 9 and columns 2-3, and 8, have been mirrored downwards into row 9 and columns 11-12.

In Example 3, there are several instances where patterns have been mirrored downwards. For instance, the 2 in row 4 and column 4 has been mirrored down into row 10 and column 10; the 2 in row 8 and column 9 has been mirrored down into row 9 and column 3; and the colors from row 3 and columns 4-5 have been mirrored down, spreading across row 4, column 4; row 5, column 5; and so on.

In Example 4, similar to the previous one, we see that the pattern of colors 1, 3, and 4 have been mirrored downwards to the rows directly below them, filling those rows with the same pattern.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to involve mirroring or duplicating the non-zero value patterns from each row to the next set of rows immediately below them until all non-zero values are propagated downwards through the entire matrix while maintaining their relative positions.

Applying this rule to the test case, we would mirror the non-zero value patterns in each row of the input grid to the rows directly below them, continuing until all such values are propagated downwards. 

Let's apply it:

Starting from the top, the first row of non-zero values appears at row 2. We copy the pattern `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]` from row 2, to row 3, and so on.

The second non-zero row is row 3 with the pattern `[0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. We propagate this pattern down through the rows.

The third non-zero row is row 6, with the pattern `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]`, which we propagate downward.

The fourth non-zero row is row 7 with the pattern `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0]`, and we propagate this pattern downward.

The fifth non-zero row is row 8 with the pattern `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, but since it's full of zeros, no further change happens.

The sixth non-zero row is row 10 with the pattern `[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

The seventh non-zero row is row 11 with the pattern `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

Finally, the eighth non-zero row is row 12 with the pattern `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, again, nothing changes due to all zeros.

We would continue this process until all non-zero patterns are propagated to the bottom of the matrix.

Given this rule, the output for the test case should look like:

bda2d7a6,"To uncover the transformation rule, let's analyze what changes occur in each of the provided training examples.

In Example 1, the number '3' at the border of the input grid becomes '0' in the output grid, while '0' within the central part of the grid gets replaced by the border color '3'.

In Example 2, similar patterns can be observed: '7' at the border turns into '6', and '6' in the center transforms to '0', with '0' at the center turning into the new border color '7'.

In Example 3, the pattern holds true again: '8' at the border changes to '5', '5' in the center changes to '0', and '0' in the center switches to '8'.

Therefore, it appears that there's a uniform shift of colors where the outermost layer (border) of the grid is changed to a new color, which subsequently replaces all instances of the original center color in the central area. At the same time, the original border color fills in the central area wherever the center color previously was. 

Applying this pattern to the test case:

- The border color '9' should be replaced by a different color, which we deduce to be '1' based on the center pattern.
- All '9' within the grid except for the border should be replaced by '1'.
- All '0' within the grid except for the border should be replaced by '9'.
- The original '1' in the central area remains unchanged.

a48eeaf7,"To solve these puzzles, I need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid.

Analyzing the provided examples:
- In Example 1, the color '5' in the input appears in the fourth row and shifts downward in the output.
- In Example 2, the color '5' in the first row and ninth row moves down to the second and eighth rows respectively. The '2's in the third and fourth rows remain unchanged but influence the movement of '5' further down below.
- For the test case, the color '5' appears in the first and second rows initially and should similarly move downwards. Additionally, the '2's in the seventh and eighth rows will also influence the placement of '5'.

The general pattern seems to be that any non-zero value moves down one row if there is no non-zero value directly below it. If there are non-zero values directly below, the movement stops at the first occurrence of a non-zero value.

Applying this pattern to the test case:
```

```

The '5' on the first row will move to the second row because the third row has no non-zero value.
The '5' on the second row will move to the third row since the third row has no non-zero value.
The '5' on the seventh row will stop moving when it hits the non-zero values ('2') on the eighth row.
The '5' on the tenth row will move upwards to the ninth row because there are no non-zero values directly above it until the seventh and eighth rows which contain '2', so it cannot move further up.

ea32f347,"To determine the transformation rule that changes the input grids into their respective outputs, let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples.

In Example 1 and Example 2, we see that the first occurrence of '5' in any vertical or horizontal run is replaced with '1', the second with '4', and the third or further occurrences with '2'. This applies even across different runs of '5's.

In Example 3, the first run of five consecutive '5's from top to bottom is replaced with '1' for the first '5', '4' for the middle ones, and back to '1' for the last one. The next run of three consecutive '5's from left to right changes the first one into '2', the rest into '4'.

Similarly, in Example 4, the first run of four consecutive '5's from left to right changes the first '5' to '2', the rest to '4'. The following single '5' remains unchanged as '1'. The run of five consecutive '5's from left to right changes the first '5' to '4', the rest to '2'.

From these observations, we can hypothesize that:

- The first '5' in any distinct run becomes '1'.
- The second '5' (if present) in the same run becomes '4'.
- For more than two '5's in a row, the pattern continues with '1' for the first, '4' for the second, and so on.

We apply this rule to the test case:

The input grid contains several runs of '5':
- First run: Second column, fourth row (one '5')
- Second run: Fourth column, second to fourth rows (three '5's)
- Third run: Fifth to eighth columns, sixth row (six '5's)

Applying the rule:
- In the first run: the '5' at [3][1] becomes '1'.
- In the second run: the '5' at [1][3] becomes '1', the '5' at [2][3] becomes '4', the '5' at [3][3] becomes '1'.
- In the third run: the '5' at [5][5] becomes '1', the '5' at [5][6] becomes '4', the '5' at [5][7] becomes '1', the '5' at [5][8] becomes '4', and so on until all six '5's are converted according to the pattern.

We notice that the first three rows and the last three rows of the output grid correspond to the last three rows and the first three rows respectively of the input grid. It seems that the middle row containing all 5s remains unchanged. The rest of the rows in the output have been shifted up by 3 positions.

Here, we see the same pattern of shifting the first 3 rows to the last and the last 3 rows to the beginning, with the middle 5s row untouched.

  ```

In Example 3, the initial and last three rows are also swapped, with other rows appropriately shifted.

### Conclusion:
From these examples, we deduce that the transformation involves moving the bottom three rows to the top and the top three rows to the bottom, while keeping the middle 5s row in its place.

### Test Case Solution:
Following the rule for the test case:
- Original bottom three rows: `[[6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
- Original top three rows: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`

Thus, the output should be:
- Top three rows:
  ```
  [[6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
   [6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
   ```
- Middle row with 5s remains unchanged.
- Bottom three rows:
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7],
   [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```

Putting them together, the solution for the test case would look like this:

In all three examples, we observe that:
- The output grid is smaller than the input grid, specifically a [10, 4] grid instead of a [10, 9] grid.
- Each row in the output grid contains only the first four elements of the corresponding input row.

Therefore, the transformation rule involves taking the first four elements from each row of the input grid to form the output grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input Test Case:

94f9d214,"To identify the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's analyze the changes made from the inputs to the outputs.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Color Change**:
   - In every example, color `3` from the input grid is replaced by `2` in the output grid.
   
2. **Grid Restructuring**:
   - The output grids are smaller in size compared to their respective inputs. All outputs have a height of `4`, regardless of the input height. This suggests that only the top four rows of the input are considered for transformation.

3. **Color Preservation**:
   - Only specific cells containing `3` are transformed into `2` in the output. This implies that there must be a condition that dictates which `3`s are preserved and which are changed.

4. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - In the transformed grids, `2` appears only where a `3` was present in the input and where there are no other `3`s directly adjacent horizontally or vertically in the input (with the exception of being surrounded by `0`s).

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:

Input grid:
```
[
[0, 3, 0, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 0, 0]
]
```

1. **First Row**:
    - `[0, 3, 0, 3]`: The first two `3`s are not isolated; hence, they remain as `0`s. But the isolated `3` at the end gets replaced by `2`.
    - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 2]`

2. **Second Row**:
    - `[3, 3, 3, 0]`: All `3`s are part of a continuous sequence. Hence, all `3`s are replaced by `0`s.
    - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0]`

3. **Third Row**:
    - `[0, 0, 0, 3]`: There is an isolated `3`. So, it gets replaced by `2`.
    - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 2]`

4. **Fourth Row**:
    - `[3, 3, 3, 0]`: Similar to the second row, all `3`s are part of a continuous sequence. Hence, all `3`s are replaced by `0`s.
    - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0]`

Since we only need the top four rows according to our observations:

Output grid:

[
[0, 0, 0, 2],
[0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 2],
[0, 0, 0, 0]

Therefore, the answer following the identified pattern is:

e48d4e1a,"To find the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's analyze the changes made in each:

1. Example 1:
- We see that when there is a row with all '2's, it remains unchanged.
- The '2' from the fourth column of the first six rows has been moved to the first column, and the rest of the row has been filled with zeros.

2. Example 2:
- Similarly, when there is a row filled with '4's, it also remains unchanged.
- All other rows where '4' appeared have their '4' shifted to the first column, while the rest becomes zero.

3. Example 3:
- The row filled entirely with '6's remains unchanged.
- Elsewhere, any occurrence of '6' is moved to the first column, and its position is replaced by zeros.

4. Example 4:
- The row filled entirely with '3's remains unchanged.
- In other places, the '3' moves to the first column, while the rest of the row gets filled with zeros.

From these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves moving the first non-zero element of every row (which is not a full row of the same number) to the first column of that row, while turning the rest of the row into zeros. Rows that are completely filled with the same non-zero number remain unchanged.

Let's apply this rule to the Test Case:

For each row, if it contains a single color (not including rows of zeros), move the first instance of that color to the first column and fill the rest of the row with zeros. If a row has no non-zero values or is uniformly filled with a non-zero value, it stays the same.

Given the Test input, the only row fully filled with a non-zero color ('8') is the fourth row. Other rows should be transformed accordingly.

Test Case:
- First three rows contain '8' in the sixth column.
- Fourth row is filled with '8'.
- Last six rows contain '8' in the sixth column.

Transforming the test case using the rule:
- For the first three rows, move '8' to the first column and fill the rest with zeros.
- Fourth row remains as is since it is completely filled with '8'.
- For the remaining rows, move '8' to the first column and fill the rest with zeros.

56dc2b01,"To determine the transformation rule used in the given example pairs, let's analyze each one:

In Example 1:
The input grid contains a cluster of numbers 3 and 2 that form a specific pattern.
The output shows that all instances of number 3 have been moved downwards towards the bottom of the grid, and all instances of number 2 remain at their original positions but are followed by a line filled with 8s.

In Example 2:
Similar behavior is seen where the cluster of 2s found near the bottom of the input grid gets moved upwards to the top and replaced with a new pattern of 8s at the bottom of the grid while retaining the original position of 3s.

In Example 3:
Again, we observe that clusters of 2s get moved upwards, and after them, a row of 8s appears at the bottom of the grid. Also, the patterns involving 3s stay intact and do not move while the pattern of 2s moves up.

Based on these observed behaviors, the transformation rule seems to be:
- When there is a cluster of 2s in the input grid, that cluster gets moved upwards to the topmost available non-zero row and a new row of 8s is added at the bottom of the grid.
- The rest of the elements, including the 3s, stay in their original positions.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:
The test case has a cluster of 2s near the right end. This cluster will be moved upward to the topmost non-zero positions, and 8s will be added to the bottom rows.

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Output:
```
[
 [1, 0, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1]]
```
The output contains only the color `1`. It seems that the output is also a reduction of the positions where `1` was present into a smaller grid where each `1` is maintained in its relative position.

### Example 3:
Input:
```
[
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Output:
```
[
 [0, 8, 0, 8, 0],
 [8, 8, 8, 8, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 8]]
```
In this case, the output contains both `8` and `6`. Here, `8` and `6` are kept in the same relative positions.

### Generalizing the Rule
From these examples, we can deduce that:
- The transformation involves reducing the dimensions of the input grid.
- Only non-zero values are considered in the output, and they maintain their relative positions.
- We keep only the first occurrence of any color vertically and horizontally.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
Test Input:
```
[
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

We need to identify the smallest rectangle containing all `6`s and then extract that rectangle while maintaining the relative positions.

The minimum rectangle containing all `6`s is:
```
[
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]]
```

Extracting the smallest grid containing these `6`s:
```
[
 [6, 6, 6, 6],
 [6, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 6, 0, 0],
 [6, 6, 6, 6]]
```

Simplifying it further based on first occurrences:
```
[
 [6, 6, 6, 6],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 6, 0, 0],
 [0, 6, 6, 6]]
```

Finally, removing the redundant zeros and keeping the minimal representation:
```
[
 [6, 6, 6, 6],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 6, 0, 0],
 [0, 6, 6, 6]]
```
But the final form should be simplified to have only the necessary rows and columns:
```
[
 [6, 6, 6, 6],
 [0, 6, 0, 6],
 [0, 6, 6, 6]]
```

Therefore, the transformed version of the test case is:

 [6, 6, 6, 6],

 [0, 6, 6, 6]]

97999447,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids, let's analyze the provided examples:

In Example 1, we see that in rows containing a single '2' or '6', those numbers are replaced with alternating sequences of the number itself and '5'.

In Example 2, a similar pattern occurs on a broader scale where individual instances of '2' and '6' are extended to entire rows if they are part of a row.

In Example 3, there is only one instance of a number ('8') which is also transformed into an alternating sequence with '5'.

The rule seems to apply when there is at least one non-zero entry in a row, replacing all entries in that row (including zeros) with an alternating sequence starting with the first non-zero number followed by '5' and continuing until the end of the row.

Thus, the rule is:
- If a row has any non-zero entry, replace all its entries with an alternating sequence of that non-zero value and '5'.
- Rows that have no non-zero entry remain unchanged.

Given this, let's apply the rule to the test case:

- Row 2 has '3', so it should become [0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 3, 5, 3].
- Row 3 has '4', so it should become [0, 0, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5].
- Row 5 has '8', so it should become [0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8].
- Row 7 has '2', so it should become [0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2].

Rows 1, 4, 6, and 8 contain no non-zero entries and therefore remain as they are.

Upon careful analysis, we observe that in the output grids, there are specific instances where the number 2 transforms into the number 1. This happens when there is a 2 that is surrounded on both sides horizontally or vertically by other 2s.

In Example 1, the 2 in the bottom row is changed to a 1 because it is surrounded by 2s on its sides.

In Example 2, the 2 in the last column of the third row and the 2 in the second column of the fourth row are changed to 1s because they are respectively surrounded on their vertical and horizontal sides by 2s.

In Example 3, the 2 in the fourth column of the third row is changed to a 1 because it is surrounded on both sides horizontally by other 2s.

In Example 4, the 2 in the third column of the second row and the 2 in the second column of the third row are changed to 1s due to being surrounded horizontally and vertically by 2s, respectively.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Test Case:
```
[
[2, 2, 0, 2],
[0, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0],
[2, 0, 0, 0],

```

The 2 in the first row at the fourth column is not changed since it is only surrounded horizontally by another 2 but not vertically by a 2.
The 2 in the fifth row at the third and fourth columns should transform into 1 because they are surrounded by 2s on both sides horizontally.
Thus, the solution becomes:

681b3aeb,"Upon analyzing the examples provided, we can derive a pattern that seems to be applied to the input grids to generate the corresponding output grids. Here's an explanation based on these examples:

Example 1:
- Input contains '3' and '7'.
- In the output, '3' appears at the top left and extends to the right and down.
- '7' appears at the bottom right and extends upward and to the left.

Example 2:
- Input contains '6' and '4'.
- In the output, '6' appears in the middle column and extends to the left and down.
- '4' appears on the far right and extends downward and to the left until it meets with '6'.

Example 3:
- Input contains '3' and '1'.
- In the output, '3' is in the middle and extends to the left and down.
- '1' is on the far left, extends downward and to the right until it meets '3'.

From these examples, we observe that the transformation rule involves taking the smallest color value from the bottom-right corner that is not zero, and expanding it up and to the left to fill the space. Similarly, the largest non-zero color value (from top-left) is expanded down and to the right. If two colors meet, they combine to form the final output.

Given the Test Case:
- The smallest non-zero value from the bottom-right is '8'.
- The largest non-zero value from the top-left is '2'.

So, '8' will expand to cover the bottom-right triangle, and '2' will cover the top-left triangle. They don't intersect in such a way that they need to combine.

Applying this rule to the test case:
```

c9e6f938,"The rule applied in each of the provided examples seems to be an expansion of patterns horizontally and vertically by duplicating them. Each row and column containing at least one '7' has its pattern extended by appending an additional copy of itself, maintaining the same sequence but doubling the horizontal dimensions of the grid. 

Let's apply the same rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[7, 7, 0],
[0, 7, 0],
[0, 0, 7]]
```

Firstly, we'll duplicate each row:
- The first row `[7, 7, 0]` becomes `[7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0]`.
- The second row `[0, 7, 0]` becomes `[0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]`.
- The third row `[0, 0, 7]` becomes `[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]`.

Then, similarly, we'll duplicate the entire grid vertically:

**Example 1:**

[0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

```

Output:
```

[0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
]
```

- The output consists of only three rows.
- There's a pattern where horizontal sequences of numbers (8 here) are condensed into a single row in the output while maintaining their relative positions.
- It appears that the output is created by horizontally merging all rows containing the number (8 in this case) within the input grid, removing any trailing zeros, and stacking the results vertically.

**Example 2:**
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0]
]
```

This example shows the same behavior as Example 1, but with the number 2 instead of 8. Again, the numbers are merged horizontally and stacked vertically after removing trailing zeros.

**Example 3:**
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

```

Output:
```
[
[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
]
```

Following the same analysis, we observe that the numbers (in this case, 1) are condensed into the output grid similarly.

**Test Case:**
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The numbers 3 are present in rows 5, 6, and 7. To get the output, we should:
1. Identify horizontal sequences of the number (3).
2. Merge these sequences while maintaining their positions.
3. Remove any trailing zeros.
4. Stack the resulting rows vertically.

Based on this logic, the output for the test case would be:

- In Example 1, the number 7 was present only in the middle column of the central part of the original grid. It was transformed into a vertical line of 7s that extends to the left and right sides of the columns where 7 originally appeared, but only within those columns.

- In Example 2, the pattern with numbers 6 and 3 was present in the central part of the grid. This time, the transformation involved extending the color horizontally, so the 3 was transformed into a horizontal line above and below the row where it was first found, and the 6 was extended to both its left and right, provided there was space and no other color obstructed it.

- Similarly, in Example 3, the number 8 was present in the central rows, and 9 was in the third and seventh columns. The 8s were extended vertically while the 9s were extended horizontally.

From these observations, we can determine the rule as follows:
If a non-zero value appears in a grid position surrounded by zeros, it will extend outward horizontally or vertically until it runs out of zeros or hits another non-zero value. If it is vertically centered (surrounded by zero rows above and below), it will extend vertically, otherwise horizontally (left or right).

With the rule established, we apply it to the test case:
The number 2 in the central part and the numbers 3 directly surrounding it vertically and horizontally will be extended as described. The 2 extends vertically and the 3s extend horizontally to the nearest borders of the grid or until they encounter another non-zero value.

Let's transform the test case based on this rule.

Test Case Transformation:
- The 2 located at [3][5] will extend vertically up and down.
- The 3 located at [3][2] and [3][4] will extend horizontally left and right.

Applying the rule, we get the following output grid:

e5062a87,"To determine the transformation rule applied to these grids, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids from the provided examples.

First, let's consider the transformation in Example 1:

- The first row remains unchanged.
- In subsequent rows, a pattern emerges where zeros adjacent to a '5' get replaced by '2'.

Now let's look at Example 2:

- Here again, the first row remains unaffected.
- Zeros that are directly next to any '5' in the rest of the rows are replaced with '2'.

In Example 3:

- First row remains untouched.
- Zeros next to '5' in other rows are changed to '2'.

The common transformation rule appears to be:

- Replace all zeros in the input grid with '2', except for those zeros in the first row and those which are not adjacent to a '5' in any other row.

Let's apply the same rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```[
[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0],
[5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5],
[5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5],
[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
]```

Applying the transformation rule:
- The first row stays unchanged.
- For the rest of the rows, any zero that has a '5' on its left or right will be replaced by '2'.
- Any zero without a '5' on either side remains '0'.

963e52fc,"To figure out the transformation rule that was applied to the grids in the training examples, let's examine the patterns:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has 6 columns, whereas the output grid has 12 columns. This suggests that each column in the input is being duplicated to form the output.
2. In Example 2, the input grid has 7 columns, and the output grid has 14 columns. Again, this indicates that each column is being duplicated.
3. In Example 3, the input grid has 8 columns, and the output grid has 16 columns. Once more, we see evidence that each column is being duplicated.

Given these observations, we can infer the general rule: 
Each column of the input grid is duplicated to create the output grid, thus doubling the number of columns in the output grid compared to the input grid.

Now, I'll apply this rule to the test case provided:
The test case has 9 columns. Doubling each column would result in 18 columns in the output grid.

Thus, the output should look like this:

e26a3af2,"To understand the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's analyze each example and their corresponding outputs.

In Example 1:
The input grid has various numbers scattered in different patterns.
- The first color that appears more frequently than any other in the entire grid is `1`.
- The second color that appears more frequently is `8`.
- Then it's `3`, followed by `2`, and `9` is the least frequent.
- In the output, only the most frequent number (`1`) is retained throughout the grid, while all others are replaced with `1`.

In Example 2:
Observing the input grid again, we see that `2` is the most frequent number.
- Similarly, the output replaces all other numbers with `2`.

In Example 3:
The most frequent numbers here are `7` and `8`. However, the rule seems to retain only the most frequent one which is `7` since there is an equal frequency of `7` and `8` but `7` appears first.
- All other numbers are replaced with `7`.

From these observations, we can conclude the transformation rule involves retaining the most frequent integer in the entire grid and replacing every other integer with that integer.

For the Test Case:
Let's first identify the most frequent integer:
- The numbers present are `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`
- Counting the occurrences: 
  - `1`: 28 times
  - `2`: 15 times
  - `3`: 11 times
  - `4`: 12 times
  - `5`: 5 times
  - `6`: 4 times
  - `7`: 3 times
  - `8`: 17 times
  - `9`: 8 times

The most frequent integer is `1`, appearing 28 times. So, we'll replace all other integers with `1`.

6a1e5592,"To determine the transformation rule, let's examine the changes made in the given training examples:

In Example 1, zeros are replaced with ones only if they are directly adjacent to a '2' (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally) in the input grid. It appears that every zero which was previously surrounded by '2's on at least one side has been transformed into a '1' in the output.

Example 2 also follows this pattern. Zeros are turned into ones when they are next to a '2', with ones appearing only where there is a direct adjacency of '2's.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:

1. Identify all zeros in the input grid.
2. Check if these zeros are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to '2's.
3. If so, change them to '1's.

Let's apply this rule step-by-step to the Test Case:

- The first row contains all '2's and does not change.
- In the second row, the first and last zeros are adjacent to '2's and should be changed to '1's. The middle zero is not adjacent to any '2' and remains as '0'.
- In the third row, the first two zeros are adjacent to '2's horizontally, thus they are changed to '1's. The middle zero is surrounded by '2's on both sides and is also changed to a '1'. The last zero is adjacent to a '2', and thus it changes to a '1' as well.
- For the rest of the rows, there are no '2's around any zeros, so the zeros remain as '0's.

Based on this analysis, the test case output would be:

```
Here, the non-zero numbers at the bottom are replicated upwards until they fill up the grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case
For the test case, we need to apply the same replication rule as seen in the third example. Non-zero elements at the bottom should replicate upwards in the columns where they appear.

**Test Input:**
```
[
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

We replicate the numbers 2, 1, 3, and 5 upwards:

- Column 4 has `2` and `2`, so all entries in column 4 below these will become `2`.
- Column 5 has `2` and `2`, so all entries in column 5 below these will become `2`.
- Column 3 has `1`, so all entries in column 3 below this will become `1`.
- Column 8 has `5`, so all entries in column 8 below this will become `5`.

Thus, the output should be:

23581191,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce their respective outputs, let's analyze the provided examples:

In Example 1:
- The central value 8 was replaced in its row with 8s, extending left and right.
- The central value 7 was replaced in its column with 7s, moving up and down.

In Example 2:
- There are two central values, an 8 and a 7.
- The 8 replaces all the values in its column with 8s, moving up and down.
- The 7 replaces all values in its row with 7s, extending left and right.

From these observations, the transformation rule seems to involve replacing all values in the same row and column as a non-zero value with that same value if there are no overlapping replacements, or mixing them if they do overlap.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:
- The '8' in the second row should replace all the values in that row with '8'.
- The '7' in the seventh row should replace all the values in that column with '7'.

The resulting grid should be:

f8b3ba0a,"To identify the transformation rule, let's analyze how the input grids are transformed into their corresponding outputs in the training examples.

In every example, we observe that the input grid contains sequences of three consecutive numbers in pairs surrounded by zeros. The output seems to consist of a list of integers where each integer corresponds to one of these unique sequences, represented only once and listed vertically in a single column.

Let's examine each example closely:

### Example 1 Transformation:
- **Input:** Sequences are [3, 3], [1, 1], and [4, 4]
- **Output:** Corresponds to the first occurrence of these sequences: 
  - First occurrence of [3, 3] -> 3
  - First occurrence of [1, 1] -> 1
  - First occurrence of [4, 4] -> 4

### Example 2 Transformation:
- **Input:** Sequences are [6, 6], [8, 8], and [1, 1]
- **Output:** Corresponds to the first occurrence of these sequences:
  - First occurrence of [6, 6] -> 6
  - First occurrence of [1, 1] -> 1
  - First occurrence of [8, 8] -> 2 (Not the first value but the second occurrence of 8)

### Example 3 Transformation:
- **Input:** Sequences are [3, 3], [8, 8], and [2, 2]
- **Output:** Corresponds to the first occurrence of these sequences:
  - First occurrence of [3, 3] -> 2 (Third occurrence of 3)
  - First occurrence of [8, 8] -> 8 (Second occurrence of 8)
  - First occurrence of [1, 1] -> 1 (Fourth occurrence of 1)

### Example 4 Transformation:
- **Input:** Sequences are [4, 4], [8, 8], [2, 2], [1, 1]
- **Output:** Corresponds to the first occurrence of these sequences:
  - First occurrence of [2, 2] -> 2 (Second occurrence of 2)
  - First occurrence of [4, 4] -> 4 (First occurrence of 4)
  - First occurrence of [8, 8] -> 8 (Third occurrence of 8)
  - First occurrence of [1, 1] -> 1 (Third occurrence of 1)

From this analysis, it looks like the output lists contain the first occurrences of unique number pairs in the input grid. Since the problem involves extracting the first occurrence of each type of pair, we should find all unique pairs (0-padding excluded) and list their first occurrence vertically.

### Test Case:
The test grid has the following sequences:
- [2, 2] first appears at row 2, column 2 (index 1, 1)
- [4, 4] first appears at row 6, column 2 (index 5, 1)
- [8, 8] first appears at row 10, column 2 (index 9, 1)

Therefore, the output for the test case would be:

6e82a1ae,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Observing the examples given, we can deduce the following:

1. **Color Replacement**: The color '5' in the input grid is replaced with different colors ('1', '2', '3') in the output grid.

2. **Cluster Identification**: The new colors in the output grid seem to correspond to separate clusters of '5's in the input grid. Clusters are defined as groups of adjacent '5's in any direction (up, down, left, right).

3. **Sequential Coloring**: Different clusters get assigned different new colors in a sequential manner starting from '1' for the first cluster found, '2' for the second, '3' for the third, etc.

Let's apply this reasoning to the test case:

- The first cluster of '5's is located at the far-right column on rows 0 through 2, which would be replaced by '1'.

- The second cluster of '5's is located directly below that at row 4, column 8, which would be replaced by '2'.

- The third cluster of '5's is located at row 6, all the way across row 9, replacing these '5's with '3'.

Thus, based on these observations, the test case should be transformed accordingly.

Here’s the transformation applied to the test case:

a3325580,"To determine the transformation rule from the given examples, let's observe what happens in each of them:

- In Example 1, the colors 8, 4, and 6 appear in the input, but only 4 and 6 are present in the output. The color 8 appears in a column that starts from row 2 and extends down to row 7 (8 columns), while 4 appears in the middle column starting from row 3 and going up to row 5, and 6 appears in two adjacent columns starting from row 4 and going up to row 6. However, since the rule seems to take into account the first occurrence of each color across the rows, the output includes only those colors that first appeared in the top half of the grid.
  
- In Example 2, the colors 0, 9, and 4 were present in the input, but only 9 and 4 are present in the output. Similarly, the first occurrence of color 9 is at row 2, which means all occurrences of 9 from row 2 and onwards are considered. As for color 4, it first appears at the beginning of row 2 and is subsequently included.

- Following these patterns, in Example 3, color 1 does not make it into the output because its first appearance is at the bottom of the grid. Color 2 and color 3 do make it in as they both show up early in the grid.

- In Example 4, color 8 and color 6 show up in the input, but the output only contains color 8 as it was the first one to appear and color 6 is below it.

- In Example 5, color 1 shows up at row 3 and color 3 at row 3, so their first appearances are at the 3rd row, and therefore both make it into the output. Color 2 shows up at row 5, but after color 1 and 3 already appeared, so it wouldn't be included even if it were earlier.

- In Example 6, the colors 1, 5, 8, 9, 2 appear in some order throughout the grid. However, only 1 and 5 appear in the first half of the grid, with their first appearance being at row 1 and row 2 respectively. Thus, the output should only include these colors based on their first appearance in the top half.

Taking this analysis into account, the transformation rule seems to be:
- Select only those colors (non-zero values) that first appear in the top half of the grid.
- List each unique color that meets the criteria in the output.
- The output consists of those selected colors arranged vertically in the same order as their first appearance in the grid.

Applying that rule to the provided test case:
- Color 1 first appears at row 1.
- Color 5 first appears at row 2.
- No other colors first appear in the top half of the grid.

Therefore, the output should have the colors 1 and 5 in the same order as they were first seen, producing a list with two elements per list item.

a87f7484,"To determine the transformation rule from the given examples, let's analyze them one by one:

Example 1: Input grid has a pattern with numbers 6, 0, 6 repeating and number 4 repeating as well, but the final output only contains the number 8. This suggests that all non-zero numbers in the input grid are being replaced with a single specific number in the output grid.

Example 2: In the input, there are several different numbers (2, 3, 7, 1), but the output only contains the number 7. This reinforces the idea that the output is selecting just one number from the input, and replacing all other numbers with zeros or itself, possibly based on some criteria.

Example 3: The input has a variety of numbers (3, 4, 2, 8, 1) but the output only contains the number 4. This again shows that the output picks out a dominant or perhaps the highest frequent unique number and uses it throughout.

Example 4: Here, the input also contains various numbers (0, 3, 2, 8, 5, 7) yet the output maintains only the number 0. However, considering the previous examples, we need a general rule applicable to all cases. 

From these examples, the transformation rule seems to be: 
- Identify the highest frequency non-zero number in the input grid.
- Replace every entry in the grid with this highest frequency non-zero number.
- If there's no non-zero number at all, keep the grid as is (though this doesn't apply to any of the examples provided).

Applying this rule to the test case:

The test case contains the numbers: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8. Among these, both the numbers 0 and 5 repeat three times consecutively, which is the most frequent pattern for non-zero numbers. Since 5 appears in more distinct rows than 0, the output should replace every number with 5.

Therefore, the solution for the test case would be:

95990924,"To determine the rule that transforms the input grids into the output grids, let's first observe the patterns in both the training examples and the test case.

In all the training examples, we see that a cluster of 2 adjacent cells with the same color (which appears to be '5' in each example) gets surrounded or flanked horizontally on the left and right by new numbers ('1', '2', '3', and '4') in a specific pattern. These new numbers replace the previous zeros in the vicinity of the clusters, but do not overwrite the original '5' cells.

Examining Example 1, where there is a horizontal line of two '5's at the center, we see:
- Two '5's surrounded by '1' and '2' above them and '3' and '4' below them.
Example 2 has similar patterns, but applied to multiple sets of '5's in different rows:
- Each set of '5's is similarly surrounded but the new numbers are placed in the closest possible zero cells to the left and right.
In Example 3, we notice the same pattern but with some '5' clusters spread across multiple rows, and the flanking numbers are placed as close as possible without touching any other clusters.

Applying the observed rule to the test case, we should look for clusters of '5' and insert '1', '2', '3', and '4' around those clusters in the closest zero-cells:
- First row: '5' forms a cluster surrounded by '1' and '2'.
- Second and third rows: '5' forms a cluster surrounded by '1' and '2' above and '3' and '4' below.
- Fifth and sixth rows: '5' forms a cluster surrounded by '1' and '2' above and '3' and '4' below.
- Eighth row: '5' forms a cluster surrounded by '1' and '2' above and '3' and '4' below.
- Eleventh and twelfth rows: '5' forms a cluster surrounded by '1' and '2' above and '3' and '4' below.
- Fourteenth and fifteenth rows: No action required, these rows have no '5' clusters.

f2829549,"To determine the transformation rule from the inputs to the outputs, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In every example, the output grid has three columns.
2. The values in the output grid seem to be derived based on the presence of certain numbers (specifically 7) in columns of the input grid.

Examining Example 1 closely:
- The number 7 appears in columns 1 and 2 of the input grid.
- As a result, the corresponding values in the first two columns of the output grid are all 0s except where the last row or column of 7s would appear, which is reflected in the third column of the output grid as 3s. 

In Example 2, 7 only shows up in the first and third columns:
- Thus, the second row of the output grid contains a 3 in its middle column, indicating that there was a continuous vertical line of 7s in the input.

For Example 3 and 4, we see similar patterns:
- The placement of 3s in the output grid corresponds to the detection of continuous vertical or horizontal sequences of 7s within their respective columns or rows.

In Example 5, the output grid reflects the absence of continuous lines of 7s leading to mostly 0s.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be as follows:
- For each column in the input grid, if any row in that column contains the number 7, the corresponding position in the output grid will have a 3. Otherwise, it will be 0.
- The output grid's columns represent the first, middle, and last columns of the input grid, respectively.

Applying this transformation to the test case:

[
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0],
[7, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0],
[7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5]]

We check for the number 7 in the first, middle, and last columns of the input grid:
- First column: There's a 7 in the second row.
- Middle column: There are 7s in the second and fourth rows.
- Last column: There's a 7 in the fourth row.

So, our output should place 3s in those positions:

543a7ed5,"To determine the transformation rule from input to output based on the provided examples, we need to examine how the color values (integers) change when moving from the input grid to the output grid.

In both example inputs, we see a pattern where the number 8 remains unchanged in most areas but changes to a new value (3 or 6) around the regions where 6 appears, particularly at the edges of the 6 patterns. Let's break down the observed transformations:

1. In the first example, the number 8 changes to 3 around the 6s.
2. In the second example, the number 8 also changes to 3 or 6 depending on its position relative to the 6s.
3. Inside the region of 6s, the number 6 changes to 4 if surrounded by 8s and 6s on all sides, otherwise, it remains 6.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

- For cells that contain 8 and are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a cell containing 6, the 8 changes to 3.
- Cells containing 6 that form a solid block surrounded by other 6s become 4.
- All other 8s remain unchanged.
- Cells containing 6 that aren't entirely surrounded by other 6s remain 6.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Let's iterate through the test case grid, checking each cell and applying the rule accordingly.

794b24be,"To figure out the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

- In Example 1, the single '1' is changed to '2', and all other '0's remain unchanged.
- In Example 2, the two '1's on the left side are turned into '2's with the rightmost '1' becoming '0'.
- In Example 3, the '1' at the top-right and bottom-left corners are both turned into '2', with the original top-right '1' turning the adjacent cells to '2' as well.
- In Example 4, the '1's form an L-shape where the corner gets changed to '2' and the rest of the '1's also get converted to '2's.
- In Example 5, the '1' on the right side remains '2', but the rest of the '0's stay the same.
- In Example 6, the '1's on the first and third columns form an upward-facing U shape, converting all those cells to '2'.
- In Example 7, the '1's form an upward-facing U shape again, changing all '1's and adjacent '0's to '2'.
- In Example 8, the '1's form an upward-facing U shape with another '1' below the middle one, which results in converting all those cells to '2', while the separate '1' at the bottom-right remains as '1' but does not affect any other cell.
- In Example 9, the '1's form an upward-facing U shape with an additional '1' on the second row, which also turns into '2', affecting all connected cells horizontally or vertically.
- In Example 10, the '1's are spread across the grid forming an upward-facing U shape plus a vertical line, resulting in converting all '1's and their adjacent cells to '2'.

The observations suggest that the rule applied to transform the input into the output involves checking the positions of '1's in the grid and converting them and their adjacent cells into '2's if they form a pattern similar to a U shape or an L shape that extends upwards or to the sides.

For the Test case:
Input
```
[
[0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0]]
```
The two '1's are in the central column, one in the middle and one at the bottom, forming a vertical line. According to the observed rules, only the '1's directly involved in forming a pattern get converted, without affecting other isolated '1's nearby. Here the '1's do not form a U or L shape extending upwards or to the sides, so only these '1's should turn into '2's.

3f7978a0,"To determine the transformation rule from the given inputs to their respective outputs, I observe the patterns closely. 

In Example 1, the input has dimensions 9x9, and the output is a 5x7 grid. 
The output seems to be a condensed version of the input where only the non-zero elements in certain columns are preserved.

In Example 2, the input is 11x9, while the output is a 5x7 grid. Again, the output retains the non-zero elements from specific columns of the input.

In Example 3, the input is 11x13, and the output is a 6x7 grid. Here, too, the output contains non-zero elements from some columns of the input.

Analyzing the test case:
- The dimensions of the input grid are 14x13.
- Similar to the previous examples, we need to extract non-zero elements from specific columns and condense them into a smaller grid.

From these examples, the pattern appears to be that the output grid is formed by taking every third column starting from the 2nd column and extracting any non-zero values from those columns. This is consistent across all examples.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Starting with the 2nd, 5th, 8th, ..., 13th columns, we look at every element and record only the non-zero ones.

Test Case Input:
```
[
[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[5, 0, 8, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],

[8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
]
```

We take every third column starting from the second one: the 2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th, and 13th columns.

From those columns, we take the non-zero values:
```
[
[8, 0, 0, 0, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 0, 0, 0, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 0, 8, 0, 8],
[0, 8, 0, 8, 0],
[8, 0, 0, 8, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 0, 0, 8, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
]

Removing the rows with all zeros, and keeping the order of non-zero rows, we get:
```python
[
[8, 0, 0, 0, 8],
[8, 0, 0, 0, 8],
[8, 0, 0, 0, 8],
[0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 0, 8, 0, 8],
[0, 8, 0, 8, 0],
[8, 0, 0, 8, 8],
[8, 0, 0, 8, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
]

This final grid matches the pattern seen in the outputs of the previous examples. Hence, this is our solution.

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

**Observations:** 
- The number 3 moves down two rows.
- The number 4 moves down one row.

### Example 7:
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 3],
[0, 0, 0],
[4, 0, 0]
]
```

Output:
```
[
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 3, 0],
[4, 0, 0]
]
```

**Observations:** 
- 3 moves down one row.
- 4 remains in its original position.

From these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- All non-zero numbers move down by one row.
- If a non-zero number reaches the bottom row, it stays there.

### Test Case:
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Based on the rule, the 3 in the third row moves down to the fourth row, and the 4 in the ninth row moves down to the tenth row.

Therefore, the output is:

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
[
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

**Output:**
```
[
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Analyzing this example, we can see that any color 2 in the input is kept as is in the output. However, where there is a transition from color 2 to color 1, the color 1 appears in all cells horizontally from the rightmost cell of color 2 until the end of the row. Color 1 does not move vertically or affect other rows.

### Example 2:
**Input:**

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

```

**Output:**

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

In this example, we notice the same pattern as in Example 1, but with colors 2 and 3 replaced by 3 and 2 respectively. Again, the color change happens horizontally to the right of the first occurrence of the new color (in this case, 2).

### Example 3:
**Input:**
```

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

 [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

**Output:**
```
[
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Here, we see that the color 4 spreads horizontally until it reaches a different value (color 8) on the same row.

Now, applying the identified rule to the test case:

### Test Case:
**Input:**
```
[
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Following the transformation rules observed:
- Any color 4 in the test case should spread horizontally to the right until it encounters another color.
- The first instance of color 4 is in row 11, column 5.
- From there, it spreads across the entire row, until it meets color 8 at column 5 in row 14.

So the solution would be:
```

42a50994,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's analyze the changes in the provided examples.

In Example 1, the color '8' appears in many cells, and in the output, '8' is only kept in certain positions which appear to maintain '8' in columns that have at least one '8' in them and removing '8' from all other cells. Similarly, in Example 2, the color '5' is removed from most cells except in columns with at least one '5'.

Example 3 shows that the color '4' also follows this pattern - it is kept in columns that contain at least one '4', and removed from others.

Following the identified pattern, we need to check which columns in the test case contain the color '3' and keep those values in the output while setting all other cells in these columns to zero.

Let's go through the test case:
- Column 1 contains '3'.
- Column 2 contains '3'.
- Column 5 contains '3'.
- Column 10 contains '3'.
- Column 11 contains '3'.
- Column 13 contains '3'.
- Column 14 contains '3'.

Thus, the output should keep cells containing '3' in these columns and set all other cells to 0.

The second and third rows with non-zero elements have been merged into two rows right below the first row. All other rows are cleared.

### Test Case Analysis
- **Input**:
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```

We need to identify the rows that have non-zero elements and combine them in the bottom of the grid. In the input grid, rows with non-zero elements are:

- Row 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`
- Row 2: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`
- Row 3: `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]`
- Row 4: `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Row 5: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Row 7: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Row 8: `[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Rows 1 and 2 have identical non-zero patterns, so they can be represented by a single row:
- Combined: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`
 
Rows 3 and 4 have different patterns but both contain `1` elements. They can be combined:
- Combined: `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]`

Row 5 has `1`:
- Combined: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Rows 6, 7, and 8 have `4` elements:
- Combined: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Thus, the resultant grid should have these unique patterns in the bottom rows and zeros in the top rows.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case
The output grid should contain the patterns found in unique non-zero rows, from bottom to top.

db3e9e38,"To deduce the transformation rule from the given examples, let's examine how the input grids are modified to produce the corresponding output grids:

### Example 1:
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Output:
```
[
[8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8],
[0, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 7, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

- **Observation:** In the output, all zeros immediately adjacent to a '7' horizontally or vertically are replaced with an alternating pattern of '8' and '7'.
- **Detail:** For every '7', its immediate neighbors in both directions change to '8' and '7' repeatedly going outwards.
  
### Example 2:
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

- **Observation:** Similar to Example 1, the '7' is surrounded by an alternating pattern of '8' and '7' in horizontal and vertical directions.

### Applying the Pattern to the Test Case:
Let's apply the observed transformation rule to the provided test case:
Test Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Applying the rule to each '7' and its surrounding cells, we get:
- The first '7' will have an alternating pattern around it going outwards until the edge.
- Since there's a single row with '7' in the middle, the pattern would stretch symmetrically on all sides where possible.

Thus, the output should look something like this:
```
[
[8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0],
[7, 8, 8, 7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 0],
[0, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
This pattern continues outwards from the '7's, changing zeros into an alternating sequence of '8' and '7'.

39a8645d,"To deduce the transformation rule from the examples provided, we need to notice that the output grids contain only the most prominent or frequent pattern of numbers in the larger input grids. In each example, there is a central pattern of numbers that has been extracted into a smaller grid:

- Example 1: The central pattern is the middle part of the input where the '8's form a cross shape.
- Example 2: The central pattern involves the '4's forming a diamond-like shape.
- Example 3: Here, the '3' and '2' numbers form a cross-like structure that was extracted.

The common rule seems to be extracting the innermost section that contains the core pattern (often symmetric) to a 3x3 grid centered around these patterns. Let's apply this rule to the test case:

```

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]
]

Let's identify the core pattern:
- It appears that the center (7th row and 7th column) and its surrounding area have the most significant patterns of '3' and '2' forming a cross-like structure.

If we extract the innermost 3x3 grid around the central area:
[
[0, 3, 0], 
[3, 8, 3], 
[0, 3, 0]
]

However, looking closely at the test data, the core pattern should focus on the '2' and '3' numbers since they form the primary symmetric structure. The correct innermost 3x3 should be:

[
[0, 2, 0],
[2, 2, 2],
[0, 2, 0]
]

Thus, the transformation rule can be summarized as identifying the central symmetrical pattern and then creating a 3x3 grid around it.

7e0986d6,"To determine the transformation rule applied from the input grids to the output grids, let's analyze the changes in each example.

### Example 1 Analysis:
- In the input grid, several `8`s and some `3`s are present.
- In the output grid, all `8`s have turned into `0`s, while the structure of the `3`s seems unchanged except for a few adjustments.
- Specifically, if we look at the `3`s:
  - Any `3` that was surrounded by `0`s or other `3`s and `8`s in such a way that it wasn't part of an unbroken horizontal or vertical chain of `3`s, was changed to `0`.
  - All remaining `3`s form a continuous, uninterrupted chain horizontally or vertically.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- This example showcases a similar pattern but with different numbers (`1`, `2`, and `0`).
- Again, numbers other than `0` (here, `1` and `2`) have been modified. All `1`s have been removed, and `2`s remain only when they are part of an unbroken chain horizontally or vertically.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:
- **Any number that does not form a continuous chain horizontally or vertically with its own kind** gets replaced by `0`.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
Given the test input:
```

```
We identify the continuous chains of colors (`4` and `5`):
- All `4`s and `5`s that are continuously chained horizontally or vertically should remain.
- Any `4` or `5` that doesn't form such a continuous chain should be set to `0`.

Let's apply this rule to generate the output:

    n_cols = len(color_grid[0])
    output_grid = [[0] * n_cols for _ in range(n_rows)]

[0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3]]
```

We observe that each row of the output grid is constructed by taking the elements of the corresponding row in the input grid and shifting them one position to the left for subsequent rows, filling the rightmost positions with zeros. Additionally, each element is repeated once in its original position and once in the next row before it shifts. This means we're essentially expanding each row by repeating its elements while shifting, and appending zeros at the end until the new grid has six rows and six columns.

Now we can apply this rule to the test case:

Test Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 3],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 4, 9]]
```

The output would be:
```
[
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 9],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]
```

Let's confirm the pattern:

- The first row is simply the input row with zeros appended.
- The second row starts with zeros followed by the first row's elements shifted one place to the left and adding a zero at the end.
- The third row follows the same pattern based on the second row's elements.
- And so forth, until all six rows are filled according to the described rule.

Therefore, the answer is:

99fa7670,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze each example:

- In Example 1, the number 2 in the second row was turned into 2 three times to its right, and the number 3 in the fourth row was turned into 3 three times below it.
- In Example 2, the number 6 in the second row is spread out to the right until it fills the row, and also moves down one row to the same column.
- In Example 3, the number 8 in the second row is spread out to the right and down to fill the second and third columns of the second row. Similarly, the number 5 spreads out to the right and down in its respective row-column position.
- In Example 4, the numbers 8, 7, and 6 follow the same pattern as seen in previous examples: spreading out to the right and down based on their initial positions.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that any non-zero integer n appears n times consecutively in the row to its immediate right and all the way to the end of the column where it first appears. This spreading happens both right and downwards.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The number 8 in the first row is spread out to the right in the second row, filling columns 4 through 8 with 8s, and also moved down to the same column in rows below.
- The number 7 in the third row is spread out similarly; it fills the fourth row's columns 3 through 7, and also continues to fill the same column in subsequent rows.
- The number 2 in the fifth row is spread only to the right because there's no more row after it to propagate downwards.

Therefore, the solution for the test case should look like this.

beb8660c,"To figure out the transformation rule from the input to the output in these examples, we need to look at the pattern that's applied to the numbers.

From the examples provided, we can observe the following:

1. In Example 1:
   - The row with color '5' moved up one row.
   - The column with color '3' moved right by one column.
   - The column with color '2' moved left by one column.
   
2. In Example 2:
   - The column with color '1' moved down one row.
   - The row with color '3' moved up one row.
   - The row with color '2' moved up two rows.
   
3. In Example 3:
   - The color '2' moved up one row.
   - The color '4' moved left by one column.
   - The color '8' remained unchanged, indicating no movement for certain colors.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to be moving the first occurrence of any non-zero number in its respective row or column to the edge of the grid (either topmost row, bottommost row, leftmost column, or rightmost column) while maintaining its orientation within the grid.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- The first occurrence of '6' in the first row moves to the leftmost row.
- The first occurrence of '1' in the second row moves to the bottommost row.
- The first occurrence of '4' in the fourth row moves to the topmost row.
- The first occurrence of '7' in the fifth row moves to the leftmost row.
- The first occurrence of '2' in the seventh row moves to the topmost row.
- The first occurrence of '3' in the eighth row moves to the bottommost row.
- The first occurrence of '9' in the ninth row moves to the leftmost row.
- The first occurrence of '8' in the eleventh row remains unchanged as it is already at the edge.

Therefore, the answer should reflect each non-zero number moving according to this rule:

6f8cd79b,"To solve this problem, let's figure out the pattern in the given examples.

In all examples, we can observe the following transformation rules:
1. If the grid has an odd number of rows, the center row remains unchanged.
2. All rows above and below the center row get their first and last column elements changed to 8, while keeping the other elements the same.
3. The first and last row get all elements changed to 8, except for the center element if there is one (which stays as 0).

Let's apply these rules to our test case:

The test case has 7 rows, which is an odd number.
- The 4th row would be the center row, so it remains the same.
- The elements in the 1st and 7th row would all be 8, except for the centers which stay 0.
- For the other rows (2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th), the first and last columns would be 8, while the rest would remain as they are, i.e., 0.

So, the solution would look like this:

d4f3cd78,"To figure out the transformation rule applied to the input grid to produce the output grid, I'll examine the differences between the two examples provided.

Comparing Example 1's input and output:
In both the upper and lower sections of the input grid where there are continuous segments of color 5, these segments become slightly modified in the output grid. In the middle row of the 5-segment block, all 5s are replaced with 8s, creating an inner frame of 8s around the main 5s block. Additionally, the rows directly above and below the middle section of the segment, which did not contain any 8s in the input, now have an 8 in the middle of their respective columns where the 5s start and end.

Comparing Example 2's input and output:
The same pattern applies here. The grid has been flipped vertically, but the rule remains consistent: the middle row of the 5s segment is replaced with 8s, and the rows immediately above and below that segment get an 8 centered within them.

With this insight, let's apply the same logic to the test case. The input grid contains a vertical column of 5s surrounded by zeros. According to the discovered pattern, we should replace the middle row's 5 with 8 and place 8s in the middle of the columns of the rows above and below it.

Here's the reasoning for each row in the test case:
- Rows containing only 0s remain unchanged.
- For rows with 5s, if they're not in the middle of the column, no changes occur.
- The middle row (4th row) should have its central 5 turned into an 8.
- The rows immediately above and below the 5s column also need to have an 8 placed centrally where the 5s begin and end.

4522001f,"The transformation applied in the examples appears to be expanding the non-zero elements horizontally and vertically to fill a larger 9x9 grid. The rule seems to be that if there is a non-zero value in the original grid, it extends to cover an entire row or column (depending on whether it's part of the first four columns or the last two rows) in the new 9x9 grid.

Let's analyze the examples:

**Example 1:** 
- In the input grid, the numbers 2 and 3 are present.
- The number 3 is spread across the entire top 4 rows (filling columns 1-4 with 3s), and the number 2 is spread across the bottom 2 rows (filling the fourth column of the bottom two rows with 2s).
- Notice that the '2' in the second row, second column results in the second column of the bottom two rows being filled with 2s while all other elements outside of these areas remain 0s.

**Example 2:**
- In the input grid, the numbers 2 and 3 are present.
- The number 3 fills the entire second and third column (covering rows 2-5), and the number 2 fills the fifth column of the rows 2-5.
- All other elements in the resulting 9x9 grid are 0s except where the non-zero elements from the original grid have expanded to fill their respective columns.

With this rule in mind, let's apply it to the test case:

**Test Case:**
- We see 0, 3, and 2 present within the input grid.
- The number 3 will fill the first and second column entirely.
- The number 2 will fill the third column entirely.
- The 0s in the first two rows do not affect the output grid.

1f0c79e5,"The rule applied in all the transformations appears to be that when any color value is found in the grid, it spreads outwards diagonally towards the edges of the grid. Let's break down the rule more concretely:

1. If there is a non-zero value, say X, in the grid, it will spread up-right, up-left, down-right, and down-left.
2. The spread stops when it hits a boundary or another non-zero value.
3. The spread happens in such a way that the color fills up the diagonal spaces, creating an expanding pattern centered on the initial position.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- First, we look for any non-zero value in the grid.
- We find the number 2 at positions (2, 5) and (3, 6).
- Then, we extend these values outward diagonally according to the rules above.

Starting with the center 2 at (2, 5):
- It would fill up-right to (1, 4), then (0, 3).
- It would fill up-left to (1, 6).
- It would fill down-right to (3, 4), then (4, 3).
- It would fill down-left to (3, 8).

Starting with the center 2 at (3, 6):
- This 2 has already been filled in from the other transformation.

Next, we look at the 8 at position (3, 6):
- It would fill up-right to (2, 5), which is already filled with 2, so it won't change.
- It would fill up-left to (2, 7).
- It would fill down-right to (4, 5).
- It would fill down-left to (4, 7), then (5, 8).

2bee17df,"To deduce the transformation rule applied to the input grids, let's analyze the changes made in each training example:

In Example 1, the input grid remains mostly unchanged except for positions where the number 0 is surrounded horizontally or vertically by at least two instances of 2 and one instance of 8 (either above or below the row containing 0s). In those cases, the 0 is replaced by a 3.

In Example 2, the same pattern applies. For any instance of 0 that is surrounded by at least two 2s and one 8, the 0 is changed to 3.

In Example 3, we see again that the rule applies to 0s that are bordered by 2s and 8s. 

The pattern holds in all three examples:
- If a 0 is surrounded by at least two 2s on either side and also has an adjacent 8 above it or below it, it gets replaced by 3.
- Otherwise, the value remains unchanged.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:

1. Check each position of the 0s to see if they're surrounded by at least two 2s and one 8.
2. Replace them with 3 if they meet the criteria; leave them as 0 otherwise.

Let's go through each row in the Test Case:

Row 2: There are no 0s that satisfy the condition.
Row 3: Second 0 is surrounded by two 8s and one 2 on its left but not two 2s on its right, so no change.
Row 4: Fifth 0 is surrounded by two 8s on top and bottom, and two 2s on right, so it transforms to 3.
Row 5: No 0 satisfies the condition.
Row 6: Second to fourth 0s are surrounded by two 8s and two 2s on their sides, and fifth 0 has two 2s on the left and one 8 on the right, so they transform to 3.
Row 7: No 0 satisfies the condition.
Row 8: No 0 satisfies the condition.
Row 9: No 0 satisfies the condition.
Row 10: No 0 satisfies the condition.
Row 11: No 0 satisfies the condition.
Row 12: Third to seventh 0s are surrounded by two 2s on their sides and one 8 either above or below them, so they transform to 3.
Row 13: First and third 0s are surrounded by two 2s, and one 8 above or below them, so they transform to 3.

Thus, the resulting transformed grid would look like this:

239be575,"To determine the transformation rule from the input grids to the output grids, let's examine the provided examples carefully.

From Example 1 to Example 4, we see that in some cases the output is a single value 0 and in others, it's a single value 8. This suggests that the transformation might depend on the majority color present in the input grid. Let's count the occurrences of each color in the inputs:

- In Example 1, the numbers are distributed such that there's no clear majority color. However, the number 0 appears more frequently than 2 or 8 in the context of the entire grid.
- In Example 2, the numbers are distributed so that 8 appears more frequently.

Given the outputs:
- If 0 is the most frequent number, the output is [0].
- If 8 is the most frequent number, the output is [8].

We need to check the frequency of numbers in the test case to determine the output.

Test Case Input:
```plaintext

Let's count the instances of each color:
- 0 appears 15 times
- 2 appears 10 times
- 8 appears 15 times

There is a tie between 0 and 8, but the rule seems to favor 0 when there is a tie based on the given examples. Therefore, the output should be [0].

d4469b4b,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples:

- In Example 1, the color '2' appears in a certain pattern, and in the output, that pattern is simplified into a smaller grid where '5' represents the presence of '2'.

- In Example 2, the color '1' appears and is similarly simplified into a smaller grid with '5' representing '1'. Notice that '5' seems to mark the positions where '1' was the most common color in the original grid.

- Example 3 follows the same principle, using '5' to indicate the positions where '3' was present.

- Example 4 shows an instance where two different colors ('1' and '0') are present, but only the '1' is marked with '5' in the output, indicating that if there are overlapping colors, the rule might prioritize one over the others.

- Example 5 and Example 6 both have the color '2' and show that the output places '5' based on the most significant presence of '2' across all rows.

- Lastly, Example 7 involves '3' and demonstrates similar behavior to previous examples.

The pattern suggests that the transformation involves condensing the grid to a 3x3 representation, where '5' symbolizes the most frequently occurring non-zero color value in the row and column of the condensed grid, and zeros are used wherever the majority or the dominant color does not appear.

Given the Test Case:
```
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]
```
If we look at the color '1', which appears most frequently, we can determine the output as follows:
- The first row has four '1's, so the top row of the output should contain '5'.
- The second, third, fourth, and fifth rows each have one '1', and they are aligned vertically in the middle column, resulting in the middle column having '5' in the output.

Putting this together, the most common color '1' appears in the first row and the middle column. So, the output should be:

90f3ed37,"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the transformation rules applied in the provided examples:

- **Example 1:** 
    - In the input, after the first instance of consecutive 8s, there are no more 8s until the end of the grid. Thus, the area below the first row with 8s gets filled with 1s starting from where the sequence of 8s ends.
    - Specifically, rows 9 and 10 get filled with 1s from columns 4 to 7.

- **Example 2:** 
    - In the input, we see a diagonal pattern of 8s followed by some isolated 8s. Below the initial block of 8s, each column beneath starts filling with 1s starting from the row directly below the topmost 8 in that column.
    - For example, the first block of 8s in row 2 fills the 4th column starting from row 7 with 1s, and so on.

- **Example 3:** 
    - This example shows two patterns: 
        - A checkerboard pattern with 8s, followed by an additional 8 appearing in the middle of the grid.
        - Below the initial checkerboard pattern, the next 8s appear to cause the following rows to fill with alternating 1s and 0s in the same positions where 8s appear.

From these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:
- After the first occurrence of the number 8, every cell directly below an 8 (in the same column) will be transformed to 1.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- The first row containing 8s is row 2.
- Rows directly underneath row 2 (rows 3 to 15) will have their columns 3 to 4 set to 1.
- Row 2 contains other 8s in columns 3 and 4.
- Rows directly under these columns (rows 3 to 15) will have their columns 3 and 4 set to 1.
- Column 3 in row 8 already has an 8, thus its corresponding positions down to row 15 should also be transformed into 1s.
- Column 4 in row 8 already has an 8, thus its corresponding positions down to row 15 should also be transformed into 1s.
- Additionally, column 9 in row 8 has an 8; thus, all cells below row 8 in column 9 should be transformed into 1s as well.

Let's apply these transformations to produce the output for the test case.

Examining Example 1:
- The input contains 8s only in the first three rows.
- In the output, the 8s are spread across all nine rows, with each 8 having four 8s in the same column and row diagonally above and below it within the 3x3 grid centered around the original position.

Examining Example 2:
- The input has 7s forming a vertical line in the middle, starting from the fourth row.
- In the output, the 7s have similarly been expanded into a cross pattern, spreading to the adjacent cells both vertically and horizontally.

Examining Example 3:
- The input has a 6 forming a plus sign, beginning in the third row and extending vertically and horizontally.
- In the output, the plus sign is expanded further out, with more 6s appearing in the cells that form a larger cross around the original plus sign.

From these examples, we can deduce a general rule: Each non-zero number (color) in the input grid expands to fill its own cell and the cells immediately up, down, left, right, and diagonally around it, ensuring no overflow outside the grid boundaries.

Applying this to the test case:
The input contains a 2 forming a vertical line, starting from the fourth row. It should expand to fill its own cell and the cells immediately up, down, left, right, and diagonally around it.

In all three examples, there appears to be a pattern where the non-zero numbers (other than the color 5) that are not in the central row get changed to the highest non-zero number present in that row.

- Example 1: In the first rows, 1s are replaced by 5s.
- Example 2: In the first rows, 2s are replaced by 5s.
- Example 3: In the last rows, 3s are replaced by 5s.

For the test case, I'll apply the same logic:

- The top row has 4s, which should be replaced by 5s.
- The second row has 4s, which should be replaced by 5s.
- Third row has 4s, which should be replaced by 5s.
- Fourth row has only 5s, so no change.
- Fifth row has 4s, which should be replaced by 5s.
- Sixth row has 4s, which should be replaced by 5s.
- Seventh row has only 5s, so no change.
- Eighth row has only 5s, so no change.
- Ninth row has 4s, which should be replaced by 5s.
- Tenth row has 4s, which should be replaced by 5s.
- Eleventh row has 4s, which should be replaced by 5s.

However, upon reviewing the examples again carefully, we can see that the transformation actually applies to columns instead of rows. The highest non-zero numbers in each column are expanded to cover the entire column except the middle row with color 5. Therefore, the correct solution should make the changes column-wise with respect to the non-zero numbers other than 5.

Let's examine the transformation rules that apply:

- In Example 1, the input grid [0, 8] is repeated twice on each side with an added row of zeros in between repetitions.
- In Example 2, the same approach applies where [2, 0] and [2, 2] are used with similar repetition and spacing.

For each example, the input grid is effectively surrounded by its own flipped version horizontally and vertically, while also being repeated. Additionally, there are added rows or columns of zeros to fill out the space needed to create a square grid if the input grid isn't already one. 

Given Test Input:

However, the examples show that the result is nine elements across and nine elements down, even though the middle part of the grid is smaller. Therefore, we'll add padding with zeros around the transformed grid to reach 9x9 dimensions.

The final result would thus be:

b548a754,"To understand the transformation rule applied in these examples, let's analyze them one by one:

In Example 1, we see that the initial 2x2 square of 2s gets expanded vertically downwards until it meets another color block (in this case, the 8 at the bottom) or the edge of the grid. There are no neighboring blocks of the same color to the left or right to expand horizontally.

In Example 2, similar to Example 1, the square of 3s expands downwards to fill the space to the edges or until it meets a different color block (like the number 8 at the end), again without horizontal expansion.

In Example 3, not only does the vertical expansion occur, but there is also a horizontal expansion of the 1s and 6s blocks to fill up the whole row, again stopping when they meet with a different color block.

From these observations, we can deduce that the rule is that any contiguous block of non-zero numbers in the input expands down until it meets another non-zero number in its column, and also expands rightwards until it meets another non-zero number in its row.

Applying this rule to the Test case:
The single 8 in the middle expands down to fill the empty cells below it until it reaches the rows with 6s. Similarly, the 6s on the right side expand upwards to fill the empty cells above them until they reach the 8 and also expand leftwards filling the cells until they hit the edge or another non-zero number. The 4s in the middle expand upwards and to the left until they meet a 6.

Here's the resulting output grid following our identified transformation rule:

1. **Example 1:** 
   - Input:

     [5, 0, 5],
     [0, 5, 0]

   - Output: 
     ```
     [

   This pattern has a central zero surrounded by non-zero elements. 

2. **Example 2:** 
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [8, 0, 8],
     [0, 8, 0],
     [8, 0, 8]
     ]
     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     [
     [2]
     ]
     ```
   Similar to Example 1, it has a central zero surrounded by non-zero elements, but the surrounding color (8) seems to map to a different output value (2).

3. **Example 3:** 
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [5, 0, 5],
     [0, 5, 0],
     [5, 0, 5]

     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     [
     [2]

     ```
   This also maps to output 2, despite a different arrangement of zeros and non-zeros compared to Example 2.

4. **Example 4:** 
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [0, 1, 1],
     [0, 1, 1],

   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [3]
     ]
     ```
   This pattern does not have a symmetric arrangement around the center, and still maps to output 3.

5. **Example 5:** 
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [0, 8, 8],
     [0, 8, 8],
     [8, 0, 0]

   - Output:
     ```

   Another non-symmetric pattern that maps to output 3.

6. **Example 6:**

     [6]
     ]
     ```
   This grid has a central non-zero element surrounded by zeros on top and bottom, and only two sides filled with non-zero elements, resulting in output 6.

Analyzing these examples reveals the following rules:
- The presence of a single central zero surrounded completely by the same non-zero number results in an output value.
- The exact output value depends on the specific configuration and the surrounding color:
  - Color 5 surrounded by other 5s produces output 1 or 2.
  - Color 8 surrounded by other 8s produces output 2 or 3.
  - Color 4 surrounded by other 4s produces output 1.
  - A color 5 in the middle with all surrounding cells being 5 gives output 6.

For the test case:
**Input:**
```
[
[0, 8, 0],
[8, 8, 8],
[0, 8, 0]
]
```

The pattern has a central zero surrounded by non-zero numbers (8), which matches the structure seen in Example 2. Therefore, the output should be:
```
[

```

So, the answer to the test case is:
Answer: ```[[2]]```",[[2]],True,True,0.0
cdecee7f,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze how the provided input grids are converted into their respective output grids.

Upon closer inspection of the examples:

- In Example 1, the non-zero values are taken from the 3rd row (index 2), 4th column (index 3), and 7th column (index 6) of the input grid. They are rearranged in a way that the first value comes from the 3rd row, the second from the 4th column, and the third from the 7th column.
- In Example 2, the non-zero values are taken from the 2nd row (index 1), 3rd column (index 2), and 6th column (index 5); then from the 7th row (index 6), 9th column (index 8), and 6th row (index 5), respectively.
- In Example 3, the non-zero values are taken from the 9th row (index 8), 4th column (index 3), and 7th column (index 6); then from the 3rd row (index 2), 2nd column (index 1), and 9th row (index 8), respectively.

The pattern seems to involve taking non-zero values from specific rows and columns and placing them in a new grid. The rows and columns involved seem to be picked such that there is at least one non-zero value in each selected row or column, and the order of values might follow a systematic arrangement based on their positions.

Based on these examples, we can formulate the rule: For each row (starting from the top and going to the bottom), take the leftmost non-zero digit if it exists, and move to the next row after finding all digits from the current row. Then, for each column (starting from the left), take the topmost non-zero digit if it exists, and move to the next column after finding all digits from the current column. Collect until you have exactly three non-zero digits.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

1. From the first row, there are no non-zero digits.
2. From the second row, the leftmost non-zero digit is 5.
3. From the third row, there are no non-zero digits.
4. From the fourth row, the leftmost non-zero digit is 2.
5. From the fifth row, there are no non-zero digits.
6. From the sixth row, the leftmost non-zero digit is 3.
7. From the seventh row, there are no non-zero digits.
8. From the eighth row, the leftmost non-zero digit is 5.
9. From the ninth row, the topmost non-zero digit is 1 (column index 9).
10. From the tenth row, there are no non-zero digits.

Collecting these digits (5, 2, 3, 5, 1):

- We need only three digits for each row in the output. Therefore, the first three digits we find will fill the first row, the next three will fill the second row, and so on.
- However, since we only have five found digits, we stop once we've filled two rows of the output grid with three digits each, and fill the remaining spots with zeros.

Thus, the output should be:

Answer: ``` [[5, 2, 3], [5, 1, 0]] ```","[[5 2 3]
 [5 1 0]]",True,False,0.0
b60334d2,"From the provided examples, we can infer that the transformation involves spreading colors horizontally and vertically with alternating patterns. When there is a '5' in the input, it seems to spread out in both directions (horizontally and vertically) until it encounters another '5' or the edge of the grid. In these cases, '5' is replaced by '1' in a checkerboard pattern.

Let's see if we can apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

To transform this into the output, we need to identify where the '5's are and propagate them according to the pattern described until they meet other '5's or reach the edges.

- First column: the '5' in the second row spreads up and down (but there's no other '5' to stop it), so it fills all cells in its column with a checkerboard pattern starting from itself.
- Second column: the '5' in the second row has already filled the first cell in this column, so it continues filling with a checkerboard pattern.
- Third column: starts with a '5' in the eighth row, so it propagates from the bottom upwards in a checkerboard pattern.
- Fourth column: the '5' in the fifth row spreads up and down.
- Eighth column: starts with a '5' in the sixth row, so it propagates from the bottom upwards in a checkerboard pattern.

By applying this logic, we get:

- We observe that the output grid is smaller than the input grid, reducing the size from a 9x9 to a 3x3.
- Each cell in the output corresponds to a 3x3 block in the input grid.
- The transformation seems to take the first non-zero number in each 3x3 block horizontally starting from left to right and moving to the next row after completing the current one.

### Example 2 Analysis:

- In the second row of the output, there's a single ""0"" which corresponds to the fourth 3x3 block in the input grid.

Let's apply the rule of taking the first non-zero number from each 3x3 block horizontally:

- For the first 3x3 block `[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]`, the first non-zero number is `4`.
- For the second 3x3 block `[0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]`, the first non-zero number is `5`.
- For the third 3x3 block `[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]`, the first non-zero number is `5` (since `4` was already taken).
- For the fourth 3x3 block `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, there is no non-zero value, resulting in `0`.
- For the fifth 3x3 block `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 3, 3, 3]`, the first non-zero value is `3`.
- For the sixth 3x3 block `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3]`, the first non-zero value is also `3`.
- For the seventh 3x3 block `[0, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]`, the first non-zero value is `5`.
- For the eighth 3x3 block `[0, 0, 0, 9, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0]`, the first non-zero value is `9`.
- For the ninth 3x3 block `[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]`, the first non-zero value is again `9`.

a740d043,"By analyzing the provided training examples, we can observe that the output grids seem to contain only the unique numbers found in the central part of the input grids, while maintaining the order from left to right and top to bottom. However, the exact rule applied isn't immediately clear based on this alone. A closer examination reveals that the output grids are formed by extracting the unique elements vertically from the central column, starting from the top until the first non-repeating sequence of colors is encountered, and horizontally from the central row, starting from the middle element.

Let's break down the process:

1. Identify the central row and column in the input grid.
    - For an odd number of rows/columns, the central row/column is the one in the middle.
    - For an even number of rows/columns, the central row/column would typically be considered as the one slightly above or to the left of the center, but with these examples all having odd dimensions, we don't need to consider that case.
2. Extract unique elements from the central row and column, starting from the most top/central position and moving horizontally and vertically respectively.
3. Form the output grid with these elements.

Applying this to the test case:

The input grid is:
```
[
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
```

Central column is: `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`. Unique elements going downwards from the center are: `1, 2, 1`.

Central row is: `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`. Unique elements going from the center to the right are: `1, 2, 1`.

Based on the above findings, the output should be constructed as follows:
- The vertical part (from the central column) forms the left-most column of the output.
- The horizontal part (from the central row) forms the rest of the output.

Thus, the output grid should look like:
``` 
[
 [1, 1, 1],
 [2, 2, 0],
 [1, 0, 0]
]
```
However, observing the structure of the previous examples, we see that the output contains no more zeros than necessary and stops when there are no new values to add. Therefore, we trim the output to only include the unique values starting from the center.

That gives us:
Answer: ```[[1, 2], [1]]```",,False,False,0.0
673ef223,"To deduce the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's closely examine how the inputs change into their respective outputs.

Each instance has the following characteristics:
- If there are consecutive 2s vertically, and a 8 below these 2s, the 8 gets replaced with a value of 4.
- If there are consecutive 8s horizontally, they get merged into a single larger block of 8s, and if a 2 is adjacent to this block on either side, the 2 gets replaced with a value of 4 at the edge where they meet.
- In some cases, the merging of blocks happens in a way that the 2s become surrounded or directly connected by 8s, also triggering the transformation of 2s to 4s.

Applying this logic to the test case:

The test case begins with a vertical sequence of 2s and a horizontal sequence of 8s below the vertical sequence. Based on the observations made from the training examples:
1. The sequence of vertical 2s will not affect the 8s until they touch.
2. The horizontal sequence of 8s will remain unchanged unless it is touching or surrounded by other numbers.
3. The 2s that are directly adjacent to the 8s horizontally should transform into 4s.

Given those rules, here's the step-by-step transformation for the test case:
- The first five rows have a vertical sequence of 2s followed by an isolated 8, which does not affect the 8 based on previous patterns.
- When we reach row 15, we see the first adjacent 2 and 8 horizontally, so the 2 should transform into a 4.
- This pattern continues in row 16 and 17, further transforming 2s into 4s at their meeting point with the 8s.

Let's apply the transformations:
- Rows 15 through 19 contain the horizontal sequence of 8s and the vertical sequence ending with 2s.
- Starting from the 2 in row 15, it gets changed into 4 where touching the 8s.
- All subsequent 2s that are horizontally adjacent to the 8s follow the same rule of changing into 4s.

Therefore, the output should look like this:

d631b094,"To determine the transformation rule applied to convert the input grids into the output grids, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [0, 0, 0],
     [1, 0, 0],
     [0, 1, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [1, 1]
     ]
     ```
   In this case, there are two '1's that are diagonally opposite to each other in a 3x3 grid. The output contains only one '1', suggesting that the output may be capturing the presence of any non-zero value but not maintaining their individual positions.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [0, 2, 0],
     [2, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [2, 2, 2]
     ]
     ```
   Here, the '2's form an X pattern across the 3x3 grid. The output lists all the instances of '2' in a single row, implying that any non-zero value found anywhere in the grid is listed in the output row but without preserving its exact location within the grid.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [0, 7, 0],
     [0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [7]
     ]
     ```
   This example shows that even if there's only one non-zero value, it still appears in the output in a row format.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [0, 8, 0],
     [8, 8, 0],
     [8, 0, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [8, 8, 8, 8]
     ]
     ```
   In this final example, there are four '8's placed either in a straight line or forming an L-shape pattern. All of them are listed in the output in a single row.

Based on these observations, it seems like the transformation rule being applied is taking every non-zero number from the input grid and putting them into a single row in the output. If there are multiple non-zero numbers, they are listed consecutively in the order they appear left-to-right and top-to-bottom.

**Applying the Rule to Test Case**:
- Test Input:
  ```
  [
  [4, 4, 0],
  [4, 0, 4],
  [0, 0, 4]
  ]
  ```
- Scanning from left to right, top to bottom, we find non-zero numbers at the following indices:
  - Positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,3) contain '4'.
- Therefore, the output should be:
  ```
  [
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
  ]
  ```

Thus, the solution for the test case is:

Answer: ``` [[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]] ```",[[4 4 4 4 4]],True,True,1.0
3af2c5a8,"To determine the transformation rule, let's break down the pattern observed in the examples provided:

1. Each input grid appears to be expanded into an output grid with doubled dimensions.
2. The original rows are mirrored horizontally, resulting in twice the number of rows.
3. The original columns are mirrored vertically, resulting in twice the number of columns.
4. After mirroring, there seems to be an additional row and column inserted between the mirrored parts that follows the same color pattern as the original grid but extended to fit the doubled dimension layout.

Let's apply this rule to the Test Case input grid:

Input test case:
```
[
 [4, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 4],
 [4, 4, 0, 0]
 ]]
```

Step-by-step transformation:
1. Mirror the rows horizontally:
   - Original: `[4, 0, 0, 0]` -> Mirrored: `[4, 0, 0, 0]`, `[0, 0, 0, 4]`
   - Original: `[0, 0, 0, 4]` -> Mirrored: `[0, 0, 0, 4]`, `[4, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Original: `[4, 4, 0, 0]` -> Mirrored: `[4, 4, 0, 0]`, `[0, 0, 4, 4]`
   
   This gives us: 
   ```
   [
   [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],
   [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],
   [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4],
   [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],
   [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
   ]
   ```

2. Now, we should insert an additional row and column with the same pattern as the original rows and columns but extended to fill the space.

For our purpose, we can deduce that the additional row and column should mimic the pattern of the grid but be filled symmetrically based on the original rows and columns. Thus, we add an extra row and column in between:

Output test case:
```
[
 [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4],
 [4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4],
 [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

So the final output for the Test Case is:

31aa019c,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the grids, we need to carefully analyze the provided examples:

1. In Example 1, the first input row contains a '1' and a '5', which appear in the output as zeros elsewhere in their respective rows, but '2' in the third row spreads to its adjacent cells horizontally and fills them with its value. Similarly, '2', '4', and '5' in the seventh and fifth rows respectively, spread left or right filling adjacent cells with their own value.

2. In Example 2, the '2' and '3' in the second row spread left and right, respectively, to fill the adjacent cells, while the '6' and '7' in the third and seventeenth positions (considering the entire grid) also spread similarly. However, if a number has no space on one side to spread, it does not propagate in that direction.

3. In Example 3, the '2' and '3' in the eighth row spread horizontally, filling their adjacent cells, and the '9' and '4' in the seventh row do the same, respecting the boundaries of the row.

From these observations, it seems like the transformation rule is that any non-zero number in a row will spread to the left and right within that row until it meets another non-zero number or reaches the edge of the row, filling those cells with its value.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:

- Row 1: No numbers will change.
- Row 2: '5' and '6' will not change, '2' will spread to its right, filling two cells.
- Row 3: '3' will spread to its left and right, completely filling the row.
- Row 4: '8' at the start will spread to its right, filling two cells, '3' will spread to its right, filling three more cells, and the final '8' will not change.
- Row 5: '7's will spread to the adjacent empty cells.
- Row 6: '8' will spread to its right, filling three cells, '7' will spread to its right, filling one cell.
- Row 7: '9' will spread to its left, filling four cells, '4' will spread to its right, filling three more cells, and the final '4' will spread to its right again, completely filling the row.
- Row 8: '5's will spread to their adjacent cells.
- Row 9: No numbers will change.
- Row 10: '1's and '6' will spread to their adjacent cells.

Taking all this into account, the transformed test grid should look like this:

7c008303,"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the pattern from the provided examples.

In each example, the output grid seems to be a subset of the original input grid, particularly focusing on rows with the number `8` present. The rows containing `8`s are condensed into shorter rows in the output, and only the numbers that are directly adjacent to `8`s or at the start/end of a row are preserved. The output also appears to merge consecutive rows if they contain `8`s and other numbers follow the same pattern of adjacency to `8`s.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

1. **Identify Rows Containing `8`s:**  
   First, I'll identify which rows have at least one `8`. The rows are:
   - Row 7: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   - Row 8: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 1]
   - Row 9: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 7]

2. **Condense Rows with `8`s:**  
   For each identified row, preserve the numbers that are adjacent to `8`s or at the start/end:
   - Row 7: All `8`s, but since it's surrounded by `8`s, it results in an empty row except for the first and last number which are `8`s.
   - Row 8: Starts with three `0`s, followed by an `8`, then a `2`, and ends with a `1`.
   - Row 9: Ends with three `0`s, followed by an `8`, then a `4`, and ends with a `7`.

Therefore, the output will be:
- `[8]` from the edge positions in row 7,
- `[0, 0, 8, 2, 1]` from row 8, and
- `[0, 0, 8, 4, 7]` from row 9.

But since we're condensing rows where `8`s are adjacent, we should merge rows 8 and 9 because the numbers adjacent to `8`s in these rows follow the same pattern without significant interruption.

So, we get:
- `[8]`
- `[0, 0, 8, 2, 1, 4, 7]`

Combining these two:

Example 1:
Input:

[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 0]
]
```
In this example, we can see that the output is obtained by first copying the input grid, then repeating the middle row three times and finally appending the top and bottom rows once again.

Example 2:
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 1],

[1, 1, 0],

Similarly in Example 2, the output repeats the middle row three times and appends the top and bottom rows at the beginning and end.

Example 3:
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 1],

[0, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 0]
]
```
The same rule appears to have been used here: middle row repeated three times with top and bottom rows added at start and end.

With this understanding, I can generate the output for the test case by following the observed pattern:

Test Case:
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 1],
[1, 0, 0]
]
```
We need to repeat the middle row three times `[0, 0, 1]`, and add the top and bottom row `[0, 0, 0]` at the beginning and end. 

So the output will be:

[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 1],

- In all the examples, the number 3 appears around the non-zero values at the edges of the non-zero areas.

In all three examples provided, the transformation involves filling in the entire grid based on the colors present in the first row in reverse order. Each subsequent row follows that same sequence but starting one step further in the cycle of numbers. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Identify the sequence from the first row**: In each example, the non-zero numbers in the first row define the sequence that will repeat throughout the entire grid.
2. **Reverse the sequence**: Reverse the order of these non-zero numbers.
3. **Fill the grid**: Fill in the grid with this reversed sequence, repeating until the grid is full.

- **Non-zero numbers in the first row**: [1, 2]
- **Reversed sequence**: [2, 1]

Given the dimensions of the grid (7x7), we fill every row with the reversed sequence, starting from the first row and shifting one element at a time as we move down through the rows:

- First row: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]
- Second row: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
- Third row: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]
- Fourth row: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
- Fifth row: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]
- Sixth row: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4]
- Seventh row: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0] (since there was no zero at the end of the sequence, 0 is left as is)

However, the seventh row doesn't follow the above pattern due to the presence of an additional '4' and '0', which means we should continue with the sequence until the end of the row:
- Seventh row: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0], but since the sequence only has [2, 1], the zeros should remain unchanged and the last two elements would be [2, 1].

Therefore, after fixing the seventh row, the final pattern would be:
- Seventh row: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0]

So, the transformation should result in:

Analyzing these examples, we can see that the transformation involves selecting the first four elements from the first row, followed by the fifth through eighth elements from the second row, ninth through twelfth elements from the third row, and finally the thirteenth through sixteenth elements from the fourth row. This effectively takes the corners and the middle segments of consecutive rows to form the new grid.

With this rule in mind, let's apply it to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 9, 0, 9, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0],

Applying the transformation rule:
- First row (0, 0, 4, 0)
- Second row (2, 9, 9, 9)
- Third row (0, 2, 1, 1)
- Fourth row (0, 0, 1, 0)

We can see that wherever the number 6 appears in the input grid, it transforms into the number 2 in the output grid. The number 7 remains unchanged.

Transforming the test case according to the rule identified:

d0f5fe59,"To deduce the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's analyze what changes occur in the transition from input to output.

From the first set of examples:

- In Example 1, the input grid contains multiple instances of the number 8 forming various shapes. However, the output grid seems to focus only on the smallest square or rectangle of 8s that can fit within the larger shape.
- For Example 2, the same rule applies: only the innermost squares or rectangles of 8s are kept in the output.
- Example 3 follows the pattern where 8s are reduced to the smallest possible square or rectangle configuration.

Therefore, the transformation rule appears to be that only the smallest complete square or rectangle made exclusively of the number 8 is retained in the output, and all other 8s outside of these smallest configurations are removed.

Applying this rule to the test case:

The smallest rectangle of 8s in the test case is seen at the bottom left, spanning two rows and four columns starting from index [9, 0] to [10, 3].

662c240a,"To find the transformation rule, let's analyze how each set of inputs was converted into their respective outputs.

In Example 1, the output is a subgrid of the input that starts from the third row and takes three rows.
In Example 2, the output is also a subgrid of the input that begins from the fourth row and spans three rows.
In Example 3, the output is a subgrid starting from the seventh row and taking the last three rows.
In Example 4, the output is again a three-row segment of the input, but this time starting from the first row.

The pattern here is that the output is a three-row subgrid taken from the input, starting at different positions in each example. The starting position seems to vary depending on what part of the original grid contains significant changes or new information.

For the test case, the pattern suggests that we should take the last three rows of the input since the output of the previous examples seemed to capture new or changing patterns. Let's extract these rows:

4258a5f9,"To understand the transformation rule from input to output:

1. First, observe that in both examples and the test case, the number 5 appears only at certain points in the grid, which seems to act as focal points.
2. Secondly, notice that wherever there's a 5 in an input grid, the corresponding position in the output grid remains the same (i.e., it's still a 5).
3. The surrounding cells adjacent (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) to these 5s are filled with the number 1 in the output grid.
4. All other cells not directly connected to any of the 5s remain 0.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Input:
```

Transforming according to the rule:

- There are five 5s present in the test case.
- For each 5, its immediate adjacent cells (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) get replaced by 1.
- No other cell value changes except those adjacent to the 5s.

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  ```
- **Observation**: `2` again appears wherever an `8` is adjacent to a `0`. For instance, the third row has no change, while the fourth row shows `2` where `8` was adjacent to `0`.

### Conclusion
The rule appears to be:

If an `8` is adjacent to a `0`, change that `8` to `2`. Otherwise, `8`s and `0`s remain unchanged.

### Application to Test Case
Given the test case:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
We apply the rule identified above:

- On the third row, the `8` at the third position (index 2) is adjacent to zeroes on both sides, so it transforms to a `2`.
- On the fourth row, the first `8` transforms to a `2` due to being adjacent to zero.
- On the fifth row, the `8` in the second position (index 2) does not transform to `2` because it is surrounded by `8`s.
- On the sixth row, the `8` at the third position (index 2) and the `8` at the fourth position (index 3) each transform to `2`.
- On the seventh row, the `8` at the third position (index 2), fourth position (index 3), and eighth position (index 7) all will transform to `2`.
- On the eighth row, all `8`s will remain as they are since none are adjacent to `0`.

Thus, the transformed output should be:

e50d258f,"To find out the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid, let's compare the first and second columns of each row in both the input and output grids from the provided examples:

- Example 1: The output grid appears to be just the rightmost 4 columns of the input grid.
- Example 2: Similarly, the output grid seems to contain the last 3 columns of the input grid.
- Example 3: Again, the output grid looks like it consists of the last 4 columns from the input grid.

Upon careful observation, it becomes clear that the transformation rule involves selecting the rightmost non-zero columns from the input grid. In the first example, there are no zeros in those rightmost 4 columns, in the second example, the rightmost three columns consist of non-zero values, and the third example has the rightmost four columns being non-zero.

Therefore, the rule can be generalized as follows: For each row in the input grid, we select the columns from the rightmost position that contain non-zero values until we reach the first occurrence of zero or the start of the row, and then we construct the output grid using these selected columns.

Applying this rule to the Test case:

The input grid:
```
[
[2, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 2, 8, 1, 0],
[1, 2, 8, 1, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 1, 8, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 2, 8, 2, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0],
[0, 8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 2, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

For each row, we take the rightmost non-zero columns:
- Row 1: [2, 8, 8, 8]
- Row 2: [8, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1]
- Row 3: [1, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8]
- Row 4: [8, 8, 8, 2, 1, 8]
- Row 5: [8, 8, 2]
- Row 6: [2, 8, 1]
- Row 7: [8, 2, 1, 8, 8]
- Row 8: [8, 1, 8]
- Row 9: [1, 2, 8, 1]
- Row 10: [] (since all values are 0)

After removing rows with only zeros and keeping only the non-empty ones, we get:
Answer: ```[[2, 8, 8, 8], [8, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1], [1, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 2, 1, 8], [8, 8, 2], [2, 8, 1], [8, 2, 1, 8, 8], [8, 1, 8], [1, 2, 8, 1]]```

However, the rules from the examples suggest that we retain only as many columns as needed to ensure every row contains non-zero values. Thus, the most appropriate transformation would involve trimming back the columns to the smallest set where all rows have non-zero values, resulting in the following optimal solution for the test case:
Answer: ```[[2, 8, 8, 8], [8, 1, 8, 1], [1, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 2, 1], [8, 8, 2], [2, 8, 1], [8, 2, 1, 8], [8, 1, 8], [1, 2, 8, 1]]```",,False,False,0.0
ce22a75a,"To solve this puzzle, I'll examine the patterns in both the provided examples.

In Example 1:
- The transformation spreads the color 5 across its row, column, and diagonally.
- In the first row and second row where there's a 5, it turns those rows into [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0].
- In the fifth row where there's a 5, it spreads the color 5 to fill the three cells in that row and the corresponding cells vertically up to the top and horizontally towards the right until another non-zero cell is encountered or the edge of the grid.
- In the eighth row where there's a 5, it turns those cells into [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1].

In Example 2:
- Similar to Example 1, the color 5 spreads in an analogous manner when found in the grid.
- It spreads vertically, horizontally, and diagonally, filling cells with 1s around the original 5.

Applying the same transformation logic to the Test Case:
- We have a color 5 in the second row, which means the second row will be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1].
- There's a 5 in the fifth row, spreading left and right, filling the entire row with 1s and extending into adjacent rows, columns and diagonals that don't contain other non-zero values.
- In the eighth row, there's another 5, which means the eighth row will end as [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0].
- Based on the spread pattern, we need to fill the adjacent cells to these 5s accordingly with the value 1.

So applying the transformation rule to the Test Case, we get:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],

caa06a1f,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the corresponding output grids, we need to analyze the changes in the patterns.

In each example, the following transformations can be observed:

1. For the top sections of the grids, colors are swapped. This means that wherever color '6' appears in the input, it becomes '7', and wherever color '7' appears, it becomes '6'. 
2. In the bottom sections of the grids, the color '3' (which is uniform across the bottom) changes to alternate between '3' and '6' or '7'.

Applying these rules to the test case:

1. We start with the top 12 rows which have alternating patterns of '8', '5', '7'.
2. These numbers should be swapped according to the rule: '8' becomes '5', '5' becomes '8', and '7' remains '7' (since it doesn't match the swapping pattern of '6' and '7').
3. The bottom 6 rows are filled with color '3', which should alternate between '3' and another color as per the observation. Since there's no indication of what alternates with '3' in the provided examples, we assume it follows the pattern seen in examples 1-3 where '3' alternates into either '6' and '7' or vice versa; but since no specific pairing was provided, I will switch it to '6' and '7' based on previous patterns as an assumption. However, typically if the original pattern had solid '3's at the bottom, they would swap to the other option (not provided here, so let's assume '6' and '7' interchangeably).

Let's apply the transformation:

05f2a901,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce their respective outputs, let's analyze the examples:

Example 1:
- In the input grid, there is a region of color 2 starting at row 2 and extending down to row 5.
- The output grid shifts this region up by 3 rows and places it starting from row -1 (which wraps around the grid, so essentially row 8), effectively moving it to the bottom.

Example 2:
- A similar pattern appears with the region of color 2 that starts in row 6 and extends until row 8.
- This region is also moved upwards by 3 rows, resulting in its presence starting from row 3 to row 5 in the output grid.

Example 3:
- In this example, we have regions of color 2 and 8 both present.
- The region of color 8 is shifted upwards by 2 rows, and the region of color 2 is shifted upwards by 5 rows.

From these observations, it seems that all non-zero regions (regions containing numbers other than 0) are shifted upwards by a certain number of rows. This shift causes any elements that move beyond the top boundary of the grid to appear at the bottom. 

Applying this rule step-by-step to the test case:
- We identify any non-zero regions in the input grid.
- There are two distinct regions in the test case input grid: one with color 2 starting at row 5 and another with color 8 starting at row 6.
- We shift the region of color 2 upwards by 3 rows (from row 5 to row 2).
- We shift the region of color 8 upwards by 4 rows (from row 6 to row 2).

This upward shift results in overlapping regions. When regions overlap, the later region (shifted later in the sequence) overwrites the earlier one. Therefore, in this case, the color 8 will overwrite the previously shifted color 2 at the overlapping locations.

Applying these rules to the test input:

d8c310e9,"To figure out the transformation rule from the provided examples, I'll analyze them step-by-step:

- In Example 1, we can observe that wherever there is a ""2"" in the input, the corresponding cells in the output have ""2, 2"" repeated in sequence across rows.
- In Example 2, similar to Example 1, wherever there is a ""2"" or ""3"", they also repeat themselves in a sequence across the rows. The output shows ""2, 2"" and ""3, 3"" sequences wherever these numbers are present in the input.
- Example 3 follows the same pattern. The numbers ""2"", ""3"", and ""4"" all follow the repetition rule across their respective rows.

From these examples, it appears that the rule is to duplicate any number across its entire row, repeating each instance of the number twice in succession. 

Applying this rule to the Test Case:
- Row 3 has a ""2"". It becomes ""2, 2"" repeated across the entire row.
- Row 4 has ""2"" and ""6"". They become ""2, 2"" and ""6, 6"" repeated across the row.
- Row 5 has ""2"", ""3"", and ""6"". These become ""2, 2"", ""3, 3"", and ""6, 6"" respectively across the row.

Thus, the transformed Test Case will look like this:

cce03e0d,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the example inputs to produce their respective outputs, let's closely examine how each element in the original grid is mapped to the corresponding elements in the expanded grid.

Upon observing the examples, we can identify the following pattern:

- The original grid dimensions are being increased to a fixed size of 9x9.
- Each cell value from the original grid is placed in its corresponding cell in the new grid, and all remaining cells (not covered by the original grid dimensions) are filled with zeros.

In Example 1, the original grid is 3x3, and the output is 9x9. We can see that the rows and columns of the original grid are replicated at the center of the output grid, and the rest of the space is filled with zeros.

The same pattern applies to Example 2 and Example 3 where the input grids are also 3x3 and the outputs are scaled up to 9x9 by replicating the input grids in the center and filling the rest of the cells with zeros.

For the Test Case, the input grid is:
```
[ [1, 2, 2],
  [2, 0, 1],
  [1, 2, 0] ]
```

We should replicate this 3x3 grid into the center of a 9x9 grid and fill the rest of the cells with zeros.

Thus the output for the Test Case would look like this:

22168020,"To figure out the rule transforming the input into the output in these examples, let's analyze how the numbers change.

In Example 1:
- A '3' at any position turns its immediate horizontal neighbors (left and right) and vertical neighbors (above and below) into '3', except when those positions are already '3' or at the edge of the grid.

In Example 2:
- A '1' or '4' at any position does the same thing as '3' did in Example 1 — turns its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors into the same number, except when those positions are already filled or at the edge.

In Example 3:
- A '6' or '8' also operates similarly, affecting the immediate neighbors horizontally and vertically, with the same exceptions as outlined above.

From these observations, we can derive that any number present in a cell propagates to its immediate neighboring cells horizontally and vertically, provided those cells do not already contain a number or are not at the boundary of the grid.

Let's apply the same rule to the Test case:

- For the number '4' at positions (1,0), (1,3), (2,1), (2,4), (3,0), and (3,5):
  - It affects its immediate neighbors horizontally at positions (1,1) and (1,2), and (1,4) and (1,5),
  - And vertically at positions (2,0), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,3).

- For the number '7' at positions (2,4), (3,4), (2,9), (3,8):
  - It affects its immediate neighbors horizontally at positions (2,5), (3,5), and (2,8), (3,9),
  - Vertically at positions (1,4), (1,8), (4,4), (4,8).

- Similarly, for the numbers at positions (6,0), (6,5), (7,1), (7,5), (8,3) and (8,5) which are '3' and '7':
  - They affect their respective neighbors in the manner described above.

Applying this rule consistently throughout the grid, we get:

feca6190,"To figure out the transformation rule, let's look at the pattern in how the inputs are converted to the outputs:

1. Each row of the output grid corresponds to one position in the input row.
2. In each corresponding output row, the integer value from the input appears at the position from the left equal to its index in the input row.
3. The rest of the positions in the output row are filled with zeros, except for some rows which may have the color shifted by one position to the right compared to its location in the previous row.

Given this, we need to expand the input into a multi-row form where each row contains the number from the input at its respective place, while maintaining the structure of zeros around it. For the test case, let's apply this rule:

Input:
```
[[0, 6, 7, 8, 9]]
```

Output should be:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # 0 is already in first position
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],   # 6 is at second position
 [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 7],   # 7 is at third position
 [0, 0, 6, 0, 7, 8],   # 8 is at fourth position
 [0, 6, 0, 7, 8, 9],   # 9 is at fifth position
 [6, 0, 7, 8, 9, 0],   # Shifted to the right once
 [0, 7, 8, 9, 0, 0],
 [7, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0],
 [8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

However, the output grid should be of the size `10 x (length of the input array + length of the input - 1)`. So, for an input of length 5, the output should be 10 rows of 10 columns.

Let's properly construct the 10x10 grid now:
- We need to ensure that each row has exactly 10 columns and only one nonzero value per row, based on the above rules.

3befdf3e,"Upon analyzing the provided examples, it appears that the transformation rule applied to these grids is to shift the non-zero areas one row upwards and one column leftwards, while also expanding these areas to fill up and to the left one extra cell.

To verify this:

1. In Example 1, the central three rows with non-zeros get shifted up one row and the non-zero block expands leftwards by one cell.
2. In Example 2, the central two rows with non-zeros also follow this pattern.
3. In Example 3, the same principle applies where the central two rows with non-zeros shift up and expand.

Applying this rule to the test case:
The central rows that contain non-zero values will move up one row, and expand leftwards and upwards by one cell.

Test Case Transformation:
- We have an area with numbers `[8, 8, 8]` in the second row which will move up and left.
- There's another distinct area with numbers `[8, 3, 8]` in the seventh row, which will move up and left.

e21d9049,"The transformation rule can be observed from the provided examples:

1. In both examples, the non-zero values from the initial input are being moved upwards within the grid until they reach the topmost position.
2. The order of the numbers in the grid remains consistent with their initial appearance; they do not get re-arranged among themselves but only shifted upwards.
3. Rows that previously contained non-zero values become filled with these values in a repeating sequence from left to right once all the non-zero values have reached the top.

In Example 1:
- The non-zero values are 8, 3, and 2.
- These were moved upwards, while maintaining their order, until they reached the topmost row containing zeros where they started appearing in a sequence.

In Example 2:
- The non-zero values are 4, 8, 2, and 3.
- These were shifted up sequentially to fill the first few rows. Once all non-zero numbers had been shifted up, the rows with the non-zero numbers originally contained them in a repeating sequence.

Now let's apply the same rule to the test case:
- The non-zero values are 4, 2, 3, and 1.
- We'll move these upwards in sequence, filling the topmost rows with zeros until the entire grid is filled with these values repeating in a sequence from left to right after the topmost rows are fully occupied.

Given the structure of the test input, there are 6 rows before any non-zero value appears. Thereafter, we have a total of 3 non-zero values on the 6th row ([4, 2, 3, 1]).

So, we need to move these numbers upwards until the 5th row from the top gets filled with 4, 2, 3, and 1 in a repeating sequence (since the 4th and 5th rows are the first rows with non-zero values).

6e02f1e3,"To determine the transformation rule from the input grids to the output grids, let's analyze each example:

Example 1: In the input grid, the number `2` appears in all positions. In the output grid, the middle number is `5` and the rest are `0`. This suggests that when a single number appears entirely within the grid, its position in the output grid is determined based on its frequency or location.

Example 2: In the input grid, we have `3` appearing three times and `4` and `2` appearing once each. The output grid has `3` transformed into `5`, while the other numbers are transformed to `0`. The placement of `5` seems to correspond to where `3` was most centralized (middle column, middle row).

Example 3: In the input grid, all cells contain `4`. The output has `5` in the top row only, which indicates that if a number is repeated across the entire grid, it gets placed in certain specific positions in the resulting grid, possibly depending on the size and shape of the grid.

Example 4: Similar to Example 1 but with `3` instead of `2`. The transformation pattern is the same - a single number transforms only the middle cell of its presence into a `5`.

Example 5: Contains both `3` and `4`. `3` transforms into a `5` in the bottom row and `4` transforms into `5` in the top row. 

Given these clues, the transformation rule seems to be:
- If a number occupies more than one position in the grid, it transforms those positions to zeros.
- The number that appears the most (or is present), regardless of frequency, transforms the central position (or positions) into a `5`.
- If there’s a tie in terms of the number of appearances, the rule might prioritize placing `5` in the first occurrence or according to some spatial pattern, but the pattern isn't fully clear from the examples.

For the test case:
Input:
```
[
[4, 4, 4],
[2, 3, 2],
[3, 2, 3]]
```

The number `4` repeats in the top row, so this would transform all positions containing `4` to `0`. The number `3` is present in two rows, while `2` is present in one row. However, focusing on the central positions for the most frequent number, `3` appears more centrally (both in row 2 and row 3). Thus, `3` should place a `5` in the middle positions of the output grid.

Putting this together, the result will have `4`s turned into `0`s, and `3`s in the middle positions turned into `5`s.

aba27056,"To understand the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's analyze the given examples:

In Example 1, the transformation appears to add a layer of '4' around the '6' block, essentially surrounding every occurrence of '6' with '4', while '0' remains untouched.

In Example 2, there seems to be a similar pattern of surrounding the central '7' block with '4'. Additionally, it looks like we're extending the '4' layer one cell further than the '7' block in all directions, except where the edge of the grid or another block interferes.

In Example 3, the '3' block is also surrounded by '4', but only by one cell, and the '4' extends into positions that are next to '3' but not part of the block itself. This rule also applies to the bottom of the grid, where '4's are added to cells adjacent to the '3' block.

From these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- For any non-zero value, we identify the blocks formed by these non-zero values.
- We then surround these blocks with '4', one cell wide, provided there are no other non-zero values or the grid's edge blocking this addition.
- If the block touches the edges, the '4's are added only up to the edge of the grid.
- '0' values remain unchanged.

Applying this rule to the Test case:
The '2' block forms a cross shape. This cross should now be surrounded by '4's. Also, the '2' block does touch the edges of the grid on both sides (left and right), which means '4's will be added only up to the edge of the grid, not extending beyond it.

In Example 1, we start with a grid and get a smaller one where certain rows are dropped. Rows [0, 1, 3] are present in the output and row [2, 4] are not.
- Row 0: [8, 8, 3, 8, 8]
- Row 1: [8, 8, 3, 8, 8]
- Row 2: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] - This row has been removed in the output.
- Row 3: [8, 8, 3, 8, 8]
- Row 4: [4, 8, 3, 8, 8] - This row has been removed in the output.

In Example 2, row [3] is removed from the input to produce the output.
- Row 3: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] - This row has been removed in the output.

In Example 3, all rows except those containing the value '8' or having '2' are removed from the output.
- Row 2: [3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] - This is the only row to contain an '8'.
- Row 7: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1] - This is the only row containing a '2'.

From these observations, the transformation rule seems to be dropping rows that do not contain '8' or '2'. If a row contains either '8' or '2', it remains in the output, otherwise it gets dropped.

2013d3e2,"To figure out the transformation rule applied to the training examples, let's compare the input and output grids closely:

Both Example 1 and Example 2 show that the center three rows and columns of the 10x10 grid are extracted into the corresponding 3x3 grid.

In Example 1:
Input grid has rows 3, 4, 5 and columns 3, 4, 5 with non-zero elements.
Output grid is formed by these rows and columns:
- Row 3 corresponds to row 1 in the output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 7, 7]
- Row 4 corresponds to row 2 in the output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0] -> [6, 8, 8]
- Row 5 corresponds to row 3 in the output: [0, 0, 7, 8, 4, 4, 8, 7, 0, 0] -> [7, 8, 4]

We can do the same for Example 2:
Input grid has rows 3, 4, 5 and columns 3, 4, 5 with non-zero elements.
Output grid is formed by these rows and columns:
- Row 3 corresponds to row 1 in the output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 8]
- Row 4 corresponds to row 2 in the output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] -> [1, 0, 0]
- Row 5 corresponds to row 3 in the output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 3, 6]

Following this pattern, the test case should also follow suit:

For the test case:
Extracting the central 3x3 grid:
- From row 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 8]
- From row 4: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0] -> [4, 4, 8]
- From row 5: [0, 0, 8, 8, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0] -> [8, 3, 3]

So, the resulting grid should be:

62c24649,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input to get the output, let's consider the structure of the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. Observing the first example, we can notice that the output grid is twice as large in both dimensions compared to the input grid. Each row and column of the input appears to be duplicated to form the output.
  
   Input:
   ```
   [3, 3, 3]
   [0, 2, 2]
   [1, 1, 0]
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
   [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
   [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
   [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
   [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
   [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
   ```
   
   This suggests that the transformation consists of taking each element in the input grid and duplicating it both horizontally and vertically.

2. Applying the same observation to the second example:

   Input:
   ```
   [3, 3, 1]
   [1, 3, 0]
   [0, 2, 2]
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   [3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3]
   [1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1]
   [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
   [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
   [1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 1]
   [3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3]
   ```
   
   Again, it looks like each element is repeated in both directions to match the output.

3. Lastly, in the third example:

   Input:
   ```
   [2, 1, 0]
   [0, 2, 3]
   [0, 3, 0]
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   [2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2]
   [0, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0]
   [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]
   [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]
   [0, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0]
   [2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2]
   ```
   
   The pattern of horizontal and vertical duplication remains consistent.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems straightforward: take an input grid and duplicate each row to create pairs of rows, and similarly duplicate each column to create pairs of columns. Here's the solution for the test case:

Input:
```
[1, 1, 0]
[0, 3, 2]
[3, 3, 0]
```

Following the rule, we duplicate each row and each column:
- First row of the input: `[1, 1, 0]` becomes `[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` in the output.
- Second row of the input: `[0, 3, 2]` becomes `[0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0]` in the output.
- Third row of the input: `[3, 3, 0]` becomes `[3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3]` in the output.

Then, we repeat the entire set of three rows again for the lower half of the output grid. Thus, the test case follows the same pattern:

Answer: ```[[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3]]```","[[1 1 0 0 1 1]

1fad071e,"To determine the transformation rule from the inputs to the outputs based on the provided examples, let's analyze them carefully:

In all the examples, the output consists of a single row with some pattern of 1s and 0s. It seems that these patterns correspond to the presence or absence of specific color blocks (2) in certain columns of the input grid.

Let's break down the rules from the examples:
- Example 1 shows that if there's a 2 in any row of the input grid at a specific column, the output has a 0 at the corresponding position, otherwise it has a 1.
- The same rule applies in Example 2.
- In Example 3, we see that the presence of 2 in any part of the column changes the output value for that column to 0, while the absence of 2 leads to 1.

Therefore, the rule appears to be checking if there's a color '2' present in each column across the rows of the input grid. If found, the output row for that column is set to 0, else it is set to 1.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- For the first column (index 0), there's no 2, so output is 1.
- Second column (index 1): contains 2, so output is 0.
- Third column (index 2): does not contain 2, so output is 1.
- Fourth column (index 3): does not contain 2, so output is 1.
- Fifth column (index 4): does not contain 2, so output is 1.
- Sixth column (index 5): contains 2 several times, so output is 0.
- Seventh column (index 6): does not contain 2, so output is 1.
- Eighth column (index 7): contains 2, so output is 0.
- Ninth column (index 8): contains 2, so output is 0.

a8c38be5,"To understand the transformation rule, let's compare the input and output grids provided in the training examples:

- In Example 1, the input contains numbers like 5, 8, 2, and 0. Upon inspection, the output seems to replace these with different sequences that maintain the overall shape and continuity of the color regions.
- In Example 2, we see similar behavior where input numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) are replaced by a sequence of numbers in the output grid while preserving the structure of the regions.

Given the complexity of the transformation, the rule appears to involve replacing the values in each continuous region of the input grid with a new sequence of values that starts from the first non-zero value encountered going left-to-right, top-to-bottom and assigns a unique value to each contiguous region of non-zero cells.

In the test case:
1. We identify all distinct regions of non-zero values.
2. Then, we replace the values in each region with a unique sequence according to their order of appearance from top-left to bottom-right.

Let's apply this to the test case:
- Region starting from [1,1] (color 1): Replaced with 5.
- Region starting from [1,3] (color 5) and extending through several rows: Replaced with 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Region starting from [1,11] (color 6): Replaced with 6, 7.
- Region starting from [2,11] (color 5): Replaced with 5, 6, 7, 8.
- Region starting from [3,2], [3,11] (color 2): Replaced with 4.
- Region starting from [2,9] (color 2): Replaced with 1.
- Region starting from [7,1] (color 5): Replaced with 8.
- Region starting from [6,3] (color 5): Replaced with 9.
- Region starting from [9,3] (color 8): Replaced with 10.
- Region starting from [8,4] (color 5): Replaced with 11.
- Region starting from [13,12] (color 5): Replaced with 12, 13.

2281f1f4,"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the transformations in the provided examples:

In Example 1, we can see that the transformation rule is applied in the fourth row and the eighth row where there was a single 5 at the end of the row. The single 5 remains unchanged while the preceding zeros become 2's.

In Example 2, the same rule applies but in different rows. Specifically, the 5 followed by zeros at the end of rows three, five, and eight have been transformed into 2's preceding the original 5.

In Example 3, similar to the previous ones, 5 followed by zeros at the end of row two, four, seven, and nine have been changed to 2's preceding the 5.

From these examples, we can infer the following rule:
- If a row ends with a 5 followed by any number of zeros, all those zeros should be replaced with 2's, leaving the 5 intact.

Applying the same rule to the test case:
- Row 4 ends with '0, 0, 0, 0, 5', so the zeros before the 5 will be replaced by 2's.
- Row 8 ends with '0, 0, 0, 0, 5', so the zeros before the 5 will also be replaced by 2's.

Therefore, the transformed grid for the test case should be:

f25ffba3,"Let's analyze the transformation rule from the given examples.

In Example 1:
- The bottom part of the input grid contains non-zero numbers.
- The output grid reverses the order of those rows containing non-zero numbers.

In Example 2:
- Similarly, the bottom part of the grid has non-zero numbers.
- The non-zero rows in the input are reversed in order in the output.

Based on these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves reversing the order of non-zero rows at the bottom of the grid while keeping the zero-filled rows at the top in their original order.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:

The non-zero rows at the bottom of the test input grid are:

[7, 1, 0, 0],
[7, 1, 3, 0],

dc1df850,"From analyzing the provided examples, it seems that the transformation rule involves filling in cells with the number 1 around any existing non-zero numbers, up to a certain distance. This distance appears to be one cell away horizontally or vertically from the original non-zero number.

For instance, in Example 1, the 2s have 1s around them on the right and below. In Example 2, the 2 on the left side has 1s above and to the right of it, while the other 2 at the bottom has 1s to the left and above. In Example 3, the 2 also has 1s around it but only up to one column to the left and right.

This rule should be applied to the test case. Let's apply the transformations:

- There is a 7 in the first row, ninth column. Thus, fill in 1s directly in the second, third, sixth, seventh, eighth columns of the first row.
- There is a 2 in the second row, third column. Thus, fill in 1s directly in the first, fourth, fifth, and seventh columns of the second row.
- There is a 2 in the fourth row, eighth column. Thus, fill in 1s directly in the seventh and ninth columns of the fourth row.
- There are 7s in the sixth row, first and third columns. Fill in 1s directly in the second, fourth through seventh, and eighth columns of the sixth row.
- There is a 2 in the eighth row, sixth column. Thus, fill in 1s directly in the fifth, seventh, and eighth columns of the eighth row.
- Finally, there is a 5 in the tenth row, ninth column. Thus, fill in 1s directly in the seventh, eighth, and tenth columns of the tenth row.

b7249182,"To determine the transformation rule that converts the given inputs to their respective outputs, let's analyze the examples provided:

### Example 1 Analysis:
- In the input grid, there is a 2 in the 5th row and an 8 in the 11th row.
- In the output grid, the color 2 has ""spread"" upwards, downwards, and sideways to affect up to three rows above and below itself, while the color 8 has done the same but only affecting one row above and below itself.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- The input grid contains a 3 in the 7th row and a 1 in the 11th row.
- In the output grid, the value 3 spreads to affect four columns on either side of its position in the 7th row itself and also affects two additional rows above and below, while the value 1 does the same but affects only two additional rows above and below.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- There is a 5 in the 6th row and an 8 in the same row, separated by some zero cells.
- The output shows both colors spreading out to reach up to four columns on either side of themselves in the same row, with 5 spreading leftwards and 8 rightwards.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rules:
1. Each non-zero cell spreads its color to neighboring cells vertically and horizontally based on a set pattern.
2. Color 2 spreads to fill its own row and two rows above and below.
3. Color 3 spreads to fill its own row and four rows above and below.
4. Colors 5 and 8 fill their own row and spread four columns on either side if possible, without overlapping zero cells.

### Test Case Analysis:
In the test case, there is a 7 in the 2nd row and a 6 in the 17th row:
- The 7 should spread to fill the 2nd, 1st, and 3rd rows, and four columns on either side of itself in the 2nd row.
- Similarly, the 6 should fill the 17th, 16th, and 18th rows, and four columns on either side of itself in the 17th row.

Let's apply these rules to the test case input:
- The 7 will spread to the first three rows and affect the middle column in those rows if not blocked by zero cells.
- The 6 will spread similarly to the last three rows.

Considering the test grid structure, the non-zero cells should spread out according to the rules observed.

f9012d9b,"To determine the rule transforming the input grids into the output grids, I need to analyze the examples provided.

In Example 1, the input pattern starts with alternating colors in the outer rows/columns and has a single-color inner row. The output is formed by taking the predominant color(s) found in the innermost part of the grid, which in this case is `1` and `2`.

In Example 2, we see a grid of repeating `8` and `6`, but the output contains only `8`. This suggests that the output includes only those colors that appear more frequently when ignoring the edges of the grid.

In Example 3, we have a larger grid with a pattern where the central column has a consistent primary color (`5`) surrounded by a secondary color (`2`). The output includes the predominant colors in the same order they first appear from top to bottom and left to right: `5` and `2`.

Based on these examples, it seems that the transformation rule involves identifying the most frequent color(s) in the inner section of the grid (excluding the outer layer), and then listing them in the order they first appear from top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Input
```
[
[8, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8],
[1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1],
[8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8],
[8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8]]
```

The inner section (ignoring the outermost layer) would look like:
``` 
[
[8, 8, 0],
[8, 1, 0],
[1, 8, 8]]
```
Looking at this inner section, `8` appears most frequently.

Therefore, the answer should be:
Answer: ``` [[8]] ```",[[8]],True,False,0.0
321b1fc6,"To identify the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's analyze the relationship between the input and output in each training example.

In Example 1:
- The color 7 in the input grid appears in row 1, columns 2 and 3. In the output, these values are swapped with 0s and appear in row 4, columns 8 and 9.
- The color 9 in the input grid appears in row 2, column 2. In the output, this value is swapped with 0s and appears in row 5, column 5.
- The color 4 in the input grid appears in row 2, column 3. In the output, this value is swapped with 0s and appears in row 5, column 6.
- The color 8 in the input grid appears in rows 5-7 and columns 6-7, and rows 8 and 9, columns 6-9. In the output, these values are swapped with 0s and appear in rows 6-8 and columns 2-3, and rows 2 and 3, columns 7-9.

In Example 2:
- The color 8 in the input grid appears in various positions. In the output, these positions are shifted downwards and swapped with other numbers or 0s.
- The color 7 in the input grid appears in row 6, columns 6 and 7. In the output, these values are swapped with 0s and appear in row 5, columns 6 and 7.
- The color 6 in the input grid appears in row 7, columns 6-8. In the output, these values are swapped with 0s and appear in row 4, columns 4-6.
- The color 8 continues to follow the pattern of shifting downward and swapping with 0s and other numbers.

From these observations, it seems that the transformation rule involves moving non-zero values from the top half of the grid to the bottom half while maintaining their relative positions within each half. Additionally, zeros are used to fill the spaces left behind. Specifically, the non-zero elements are moved downwards and the bottom half receives the new placement of these elements.

Applying the same rule to the test case:

Original Test Input:
```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[3, 4, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

First, identify all non-zero values in the top half (rows 1-5) and their positions:
- Row 2: [8, 8, 8, 8]
- Row 3: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
- Row 4: [8, 8]

Then move these non-zero elements to the bottom half (rows 6-10) starting from the first non-zero row in the bottom half, leaving 0s in the original positions.

After moving, the non-zero elements would be in:
- Row 6: [8, 8, 8, 8]
- Row 7: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
- Row 8: [8, 8]

Finally, place the values from the lower part of the input grid into the upper part where non-zero values were removed.

So the output should look like this:

0520fde7,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

In Example 1:
- The input pattern of ""1"" and ""5"" appears in the first column and fourth column respectively.
- In the output, these columns are replaced with zeros, except where both ""1"" and ""5"" appear in the same row, which is then replaced with ""2"".

In Example 2:
- Similar pattern observed: wherever ""1"" and ""5"" occur in the same row but different columns, that location in the output becomes ""2"", and the rest of the entries become ""0"".

In Example 3:
- Again, we see the same rule applied: if ""1"" and ""5"" are in the same row but different columns, the positions in the output where they were are changed to ""0"" and their common row position to ""2"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be transforming the grid based on the presence of ""1"" and ""5"" in the same row. If there's a ""1"" and ""5"" in the same row, the output at those positions changes to ""2"", and all other positions in that row change to ""0"".

Applying this rule to the Test Case:
- First row contains ""1"" and ""5"", so its output is `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Second row also contains ""1"" and ""5"", so its output is `[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Third row has ""1"" and ""5"", therefore it transforms into `[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

47c1f68c,"To figure out the transformation rule from the input to the output grids, let's analyze the changes in each example:

### Example 1:
- **Input:** Contains '0' (white) and '2' (some other color).
- **Output:** The '2' seems to spread diagonally and fills certain positions symmetrically relative to its center.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** Contains '0' (white), '3' (one color), and '8' (another color).
- **Output:** The '8' spreads horizontally across every row where it appears, filling the gaps with '0', while the '3' spreads vertically in columns where it appears, also filling the gaps with '0'.

### Example 3:
- **Input:** Contains '0' (white), '2' (one color), '4' (another color).
- **Output:** The '4' takes over the entire central column, and '2' remains unchanged or disappears. The pattern suggests that '4' spreads vertically in the central column while replacing all other colors with '0', and the '2' seems to disappear or transform into '0'.

Given these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule:

1. **Color '2':** It spreads diagonally in both directions.
2. **Color '3':** It spreads vertically.
3. **Color '4':** It spreads vertically but only in the central column and replaces other colors with '0'.
4. **Color '8':** It spreads horizontally and replaces other colors with '0'.

Now, apply this rule to the test case:
The test case involves the colors '0', '3', and '8'. 
- The '8' color in the central rows will spread horizontally.
- The '3' color will spread vertically but within the bounds of the '8' spread.

Let's follow through with the transformation:

1. Identify where '8' is present:
   - Rows 4, 5, and 6 contain '8'.

2. Spread '8' horizontally in these rows and replace other colors with '0':
   - Row 4 becomes [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
   - Row 5 becomes [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
   - Row 6 becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3].

3. Identify where '3' is present:
   - '3' appears only in the last row.

4. Spread '3' vertically, filling the corresponding columns:
   - Column 6 and 7 get filled with '3' throughout the grid.

1. The input grids have numbers scattered across different cells.
2. The output grids only contain certain numbers in specific cells.
3. Upon closer inspection, we can see that only numbers on the main diagonal of the input grid (from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner) seem to influence the final output grid positions.

The pattern observed is:
- If there are numbers in the input on the main diagonal, these numbers are placed at the intersection of the second row and second column in the output grid.
- If there are no numbers in the input on the main diagonal, those positions in the output grid remain as `0`.
- Only two such intersections are filled with numbers in each example, and they seem to be influenced by the first two non-zero elements on the diagonal.

In the test case, we need to follow the same rule:
- First non-zero element on the main diagonal: `4` (in position [1][1]).

d5d6de2d,"To deduce the transformation rule applied to these grids, let's analyze the provided examples:

- In Example 1, there was a block of '2' in the middle part of the grid, and it was transformed into a pattern where '3' replaced exactly one cell of the original '2', placed at the center of that block.
- In Example 2, we see a similar pattern of '2' forming a smaller block in the middle of the grid. Again, a single '3' appears at the center of this block.
- In Example 3, the grid contains a larger block of '2' in the central area (a vertical line and an additional horizontal row of '2' above the vertical line), which gets transformed by replacing the central cells with '3'. 

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the rule being applied is:
- Find the largest continuous block of '2' in the grid.
- Replace the centermost cell(s) of this block with '3'.

For determining the centermost cells, if the block length or width is odd, there is precisely one cell in the middle; if even, the two central cells are considered.

Let's apply this rule to the Test Case.

The test case has a large block of '2' spanning vertically from rows 4 to 9, except the first and last columns, forming a block from column 2 to 8. This block is 6 rows high and 7 columns wide, making its center fall into the 5th row and the 4th and 5th columns.

So, we replace the centermost cells (in the 5th row, columns 4 and 5) with '3'.

- In Example 1, the input grid contains sequences of numbers, and the output grid only has the first three non-zero rows that contain those sequences.
- In Example 2, we see that the output grid consists of the first three non-zero values found in the input grid, starting from the top left corner and moving down and right until three non-zero elements are found in each row.

This implies that the rule is to extract the first three non-zero elements from each row of the input grid in order to form the output grid. 

We also notice that if there are fewer than three non-zero elements in a row, the output will have those elements and fill with zeros to complete the row length to three.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

1. Scan the first row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0] -> First three non-zeros: [9]
2. Scan the second row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 5, 0, 0] -> First three non-zeros: [9, 5]
3. Scan the third row: [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0] -> First three non-zeros: [4, 9]
4. Scan the fourth row: [0, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> First three non-zeros: [5, 4]
5. Scan the fifth row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0] -> First three non-zeros: [8]
6. Scan the sixth row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> First three non-zeros: [5]
7. Scan the seventh row: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> First three non-zeros: [5]
8. Scan the eighth row: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> First three non-zeros: [2, 2]

d23f8c26,"To determine the transformation rule applied in these examples, let's compare the inputs and outputs carefully:

- In Example 1, the number 6 and 9 have been replaced with 0, while the numbers 0, 3, and 4 remained unchanged. 
- In Example 2, the numbers 8 and 5 have been replaced with 0, while the numbers 0, 3, 4, and 6 remained unchanged.
- In Example 3, the numbers 3, 6, and 8 have been replaced with 0, while the numbers 0, 4, and 7 remained unchanged.

From these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves replacing specific numbers with 0, but these numbers seem to vary across different inputs. The common theme is that all non-zero numbers except one or two unique numbers for each grid are replaced with 0. However, the specific numbers that are not turned to zero appear to be the ones that only occur once in each row or column of their respective grids.

Therefore, the rule seems to be: Replace every number in the grid with 0 except for those that appear exactly once in their row or column.

Applying the rule to the test case:
The test case is:

```python
[
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7],
[8, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 3],
[0, 7, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0]]
```

Let's examine each row and column:

1. **First row**: Numbers are 0 (twice), 3 (once), 0 (twice), 0 (twice), 7 (once).
   - Only 3 and 7 should remain, but since there are two 0s, none of them should be kept. So, the first row becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

2. **Second row**: Numbers are 8 (twice), 1 (once), 0 (three times).
   - Only 1 should remain. So, the second row becomes [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

3. **Third row**: Numbers are 0 (twice), 3 (twice), 8 (once), 3 (once).
   - Only 8 should remain. So, the third row becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8].

4. **Fourth row**: Numbers are 0 (three times), 7 (twice), 1 (once).
   - Only 1 should remain. So, the fourth row becomes [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

5. **Fifth row**: All zeros. Nothing changes here. So, the fifth row remains [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

6. **Sixth row**: Numbers are 1 (twice), 8 (once), 6 (once).
   - Only 8 and 6 should remain, but since there are two 1s, none of them should be kept. So, the sixth row becomes [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0].

7. **Seventh row**: Numbers are 0 (twice), 8 (twice), 6 (once), 1 (once).
   - Only 6 and 1 should remain, but since there are two 8s, none of them should be kept. So, the seventh row becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0].

8d510a79,"To figure out the transformation rule from the given training examples, let's compare the cells in the input grids with those in the output grids.

### Observations:
1. **Color 5 Cells**: These cells remain unchanged across all examples.
2. **Color 1 and 2 Cells**: 
    - Whenever a cell has a value of 1 or 2 in the input, and if its immediate left or right neighbor also contains a 1 or 2 respectively (in the same row), then that neighbor's value is copied over to the other side of the row.
    - If a 1 is present, it appears on the opposite side as a second 1 in the same row.
    - If a 2 is present, it appears on the opposite side as a second 2 in the same row.

Let's apply these observations to the test case:

- For any row containing a `1`, we should check if there is another `1` on the opposite side of the row and vice versa for `2`.
- Row 1: All zeros, so no transformation needed.
- Row 2: Has a `2` at index 1 and a `1` at index 3, hence `2` should appear at index 8 and `1` should appear at index 7.
- Row 3: Has a `1` at index 6, so a `1` should also appear at index 3.
- Row 4: All zeros, so no transformation needed.
- Row 5: Full of `5`s, remains unchanged.
- Row 6: All zeros, so no transformation needed.
- Row 7: All zeros, so no transformation needed.
- Row 8: Has a `1` at index 2 and a `2` at index 5, hence `1` should appear at index 7 and `2` should appear at index 4.
- Row 9: Has a `2` at index 0, so a `2` should appear at index 9.
- Row 10: Has a `1` at index 9, so a `1` should appear at index 0.

Therefore, the transformation for the test case would look like this:

88a62173,"To derive the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's first analyze each one:

- In Example 1, the input contains mostly 2s with a few 0s. The output shows only the unique pairs of colors found in the input grid.
- In Example 2, the input has a pattern of 1s and 0s, and again, the output represents these unique pairs of adjacent colors (horizontally or vertically).
- In Example 3, the input consists of 8s and 0s, and similarly, the output includes the unique pairs found in the input.

From these observations, the common transformation seems to be identifying all unique adjacent color pairs (including diagonals) from the input grid and listing them in a 2x2 output grid where the first row represents the pairs and the second row indicates their frequency (order doesn't matter).

However, the second row in the outputs does not match the count of adjacent pairs exactly in the given examples, meaning that perhaps we only need to identify and list the unique pairs without their counts. 

Let's apply this to the test case:

The test case grid:
```
[
[5, 5, 0, 5, 0],
[0, 5, 0, 0, 5],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
[0, 5, 0, 0, 5]]
```

Analyzing the grid for unique adjacent pairs (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally):
- There's a pair (5, 0)
- Also (0, 5)

The pairs (5, 5), (0, 0) don’t matter since they aren't different transitions.

Thus, the output should contain just these two pairs.

Answer: ```[[5, 0], [0, 5]]```","[[5 0]

8403a5d5,"To determine the transformation rule applied in the examples to turn each input into its corresponding output, let's analyze the pattern:

1. In all three training examples, the bottom row of the input grid has a single non-zero value.
2. This value is mirrored along the vertical axis of the bottom row, turning the single value into two identical values, spaced symmetrically around the center.
3. Then, the values on either side of the mirrored points propagate upwards column-wise, filling the entire grid except the first column which remains unchanged.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step-by-step:

- Identify the non-zero value in the bottom row: `1`.
- Mirror this `1` along the vertical center of the bottom row: `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` turns into `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]`.
- Propagate the `1`s upwards in their respective columns, skipping the first column which remains zero:

Thus, following this rule, the solution for the test case would be:

82819916,"To solve this problem, I need to figure out the pattern or rule that converts the input grids into their corresponding outputs.

From looking at the provided training examples, the rule seems to be:

If a number (other than zero) appears followed by zero or is the last number in a row, and there is more space to fill until the end of the row with zeros, then the number will repeat itself in those zeros. In other words, the non-zero numbers in a row are cloned to fill the remaining spaces of the row with zeros.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

The test case input has some numbers interspersed with zeros. We need to clone the last non-zero number until the end of the row if it ends with a zero, or directly clone the number sequence if there are only zeros after a sequence of non-zero numbers.

Applying the rule to each row:
- Row 1: [2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1] -> Remain unchanged since no trailing zeros.
- Row 4: [8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Clone '3' to fill the remaining zeros, resulting in [8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3].
- Row 7: [1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Clone '4' to fill the remaining zeros, resulting in [1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4].
- Row 10: [6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Clone '8' to fill the remaining zeros, resulting in [6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8].
- Row 12: [1, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Clone '6' to fill the remaining zeros, resulting in [1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6].

Other rows remain unchanged because they contain no numbers followed by zeros.

In Example 1:
- All the 5's in the input grid turn into 1's in the output grid.
- The only exception occurs at the bottom-right corner where the pattern ends, changing the final 5 into a 2 in the output grid.

In Example 2:
- Again, all the 5's except the last one in the sequence transform into 1's in the output grid.
- The last 5 in the sequence is transformed into a 2 at the same position.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is:
- Replace all 5's with 1's.
- If there are any 5's near the edge of the grid (specifically the ones that appear towards the end of a line or column), replace them with 2's instead.

In all the examples, I notice that wherever there are three consecutive '2's horizontally in the input, they are replaced with alternating '2' and '1's in the output starting with '2'. This means that the first position remains '2', the second becomes '1', and the third becomes '2' again. Let's confirm this pattern:

- In Example 1, the second row consists entirely of '2's. It remains as is because it's not three consecutive '2's.
- In the third to fourth rows of Example 1, we see '2' followed by two zeros and another '2'. The zeros are untouched, but the '2' after them changes to '1'.
- In Example 2, there is a horizontal strip of five '2's in the fourth row. It gets transformed into alternating '2' and '1'.
- Example 3 shows more complex patterns, but the rule still applies wherever there are three consecutive '2's, even within larger segments of '2's.

Thus, the rule seems to be that horizontal segments of '2's are changed into an alternating pattern of '2' and '1' starting with '2' if they consist of three or more '2's.

Applying the same transformation rule to the test case:

- First row: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0]
- Second to fourth rows: Consist of groups of two '2's, which remain unchanged.
- Fifth row: [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0] → [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
- Sixth row: [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0] → [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
- Seventh row: [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] → [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]

The last two non-zero rows are [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5].

bdad9b1f,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's analyze the patterns in the given examples.

In Example 1, the input grid had two rows with 8s at the end. These 8s remained unchanged. However, the third row had two 2s followed by zeros. In the output, the two 2s next to each other have been replaced by four 2s, and the zero that was adjacent to the two 2s changed into a 4.

In Example 2, there were two rows with 8s at the end, these remained unchanged too. The fourth row contained two 2s at the end, but unlike Example 1, they were separated by zeros. In the resulting output, the zeros directly adjacent to the 2s turned into 4s while maintaining the 2s' positions.

Based on these observations, we can infer that whenever two same numbers (other than 0) meet next to each other or with zeros in between them within a row, those zeros change into half the sum of their neighboring numbers. If the neighboring numbers are the same, the zero changes into that number. For two different numbers, the zero would become their average (rounded down if necessary).

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input Grid:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

We'll inspect each row:

- First and second rows: Only have numbers 0 and 8 at the end, so remain unchanged.
- Third and fourth rows: All zeros and thus remain unchanged.
- Fifth row: Contains two 2s side by side with zeros in between. Zeros turn into 2s, following the pattern seen before.
- Sixth row: All zeros and remains unchanged.

After applying the rule to the fifth row, the final output is:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The zeros in the fifth row turn into 2s because the two 2s are next to each other, filling the space between them as well as the zeros surrounding them.

bd4472b8,"To figure out the transformation rule being applied, let's analyze the provided examples:

In each of the examples, the input grid contains a top row with distinct color patterns. The following rows that only contain zeros are replaced according to the pattern found in the first row, with zeros being replaced by the colors from the first row, filling the entire row with one color at a time.

- Example 1: The input has a top row [2, 1, 4] and subsequent rows of 5s followed by several rows of zeros. The zeros are filled row by row with the sequence [2, 1, 4]. After using all three numbers, it repeats [2, 1, 4].

- Example 2: The input has a top row [3, 2, 1, 4] and rows below with zeros. The zeros are filled sequentially with [3, 2, 1, 4], repeating once all colors have been used.

- Example 3: The input has a top row [8, 3] and rows below with zeros. The zeros are filled in the order [8, 3] and again repeat after both numbers have been used.

Taking the above observations into account, we can deduce the rule: The rows following the initial non-zero row(s) are filled with the colors from the first non-zero row in the order they appear, cycling through these colors until all zero rows are filled.

Applying this rule to the test case:

The test case starts with a top row [1, 2, 3, 4, 8] followed by a row of 5s and several rows of zeros. According to the pattern observed, each zero row should be filled in the order of the colors in the top row: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8]. Since there are many more rows of zeros than colors, we need to repeat the process.

253bf280,"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the transformation process with the provided examples:

1. We observe that when an '8' appears in the input, certain positions around it are filled with '3' in the output.
2. The pattern around '8' seems to be filling vertically and horizontally, but not diagonally, and only within a limited range.

Examining each example closely:

- In Example 1, an '8' at position (3, 2) and (3, 10) fills the horizontal row between them with '3'.
- Example 2 shows an '8' at position (1, 5) and (1, 10), which fills the horizontal line between them with '3'.
- Example 3 and Example 4, where '8' is isolated, show no changes since there are no other '8's to form a connection.
- In Example 5 through Example 8, '8's fill the immediate surrounding cells horizontally or vertically in a straight line up to the nearest '8'.

The rule appears to be that if an '8' has another '8' in the same row or column within a distance greater than 1 cell, then each cell between those two '8's gets filled with '3'.

Let's apply this logic to the test case:

- At position (1, 2) and (1, 10), there is an '8' on both sides of an empty space, so we fill the positions (1, 3) to (1, 9) with '3'.
- At position (6, 7) and (6, 12), there is an '8' on both sides of an empty space, so we fill positions (6, 8) to (6, 11) with '3'.
- At position (7, 1) and (8, 1), there are two '8's in consecutive rows and columns respectively, so we don't need to fill any additional spaces.

Therefore, the solution for the test case should look like this:

- In Example 2, only one continuous horizontal sequence (of 4s) was found, which was repeated.
- In Example 3, the largest continuous horizontal sequence of 8s was taken followed by the largest of 7s and 2s in their order of appearance width-wise.
- In Example 4, the rule remains the same — identifying the largest continuous horizontal sequences of numbers.

Given these observations, it seems that the transformation involves extracting the longest consecutive segments of non-zero numbers horizontally from left to right across all rows, and grouping them according to the order in which they first appear.

1. **Identify the longest sequences for each number:** 
   - 4 appears in the second row and in the third and fourth rows for two positions each.
   - 3 appears in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth rows for three positions each.
   - 5 appears in the eighth and ninth rows for two positions each.
   - 6 appears in the seventh, eighth, and ninth rows for two positions in total.

2. **Order of first appearance:** 
   - 4 comes first,
   - Then 3,
   - Then 5,
   - And finally 6.

3. **Extract the longest sequences:** 
   - For 4, we have [4, 4] which appears twice in different rows but can be condensed into `[4, 4]`.
   - For 3, we have [3, 3, 3] appearing four times, which also condenses to `[3, 3, 3]`.
   - For 5, the longest segment is [5, 5].
   - For 6, the longest segment is [6, 6].

4. **Combine into the output:** Since the longest segments are `[3, 3, 3]`, `[4, 4]`, `[5, 5]`, and `[6, 6]`, and need to be presented in order of first appearance, the resulting output is:
```

### Observations:
- In Example 1, the input grid contains 2s which seem to get replaced or surrounded by 5s in the output.
- In Example 2, the input grid also shows various placements of 2s and 3s, but the outputs all have a consistent pattern of 5s forming a larger rectangle around the original non-zero numbers.
- Example 3 also follows the same logic where 1s and 4s are present in the input and are transformed into a pattern where 5s surround the non-zero elements.

### Deductions:
- It appears that wherever there is a non-zero element in the input, the output places a 5 around those elements, extending the coverage up, down, left, and right to form a larger rectangle encompassing all occurrences of non-zero elements.

### Test Case Analysis:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
]

Output should be based on the presence of non-zero elements (4s and 5s) and the surrounding pattern:

Let's trace the locations of non-zero numbers (4s and 5s):
- The non-zero numbers (4s and 5s) occupy positions spread throughout the rows and columns.

Based on the deductions from previous examples, we need to find the smallest rectangle that encompasses all non-zero elements and then fill it with 5s.

### Smallest Rectangle Encompassing Non-Zero Elements:
From the test grid:
- Rows: Between row 1 and row 13.
- Columns: Between column 5 and column 13.

Thus, the rectangle would span from rows 1 through 13 and columns 5 through 13.

### Apply Transformation:
The output grid will have all positions within this rectangle filled with 5s while the rest will be 0s.

### Example 1 Analysis
- **Input**: 
    [
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2],

    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]]
- **Output**:
    [
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],

    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]]

The pattern here seems to involve changing any instances of '3' to match the adjacent color ('1' or '2'), when those adjacent colors are on the opposite edges of the '3'.

    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],

Similar to the previous example, the number '3' is replaced with the adjacent edge color.

### Example 3 Analysis
In Example 3, we observe the same transformation rule where the number '3' is replaced with the adjacent color on the edges of the grid.
- **Input**:
    [
    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

    [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]]
- **Output**:
    [
    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]]

Again, the '3' values are swapped for the adjacent edge colors.

### Conclusion
From these examples, the rule is clear: Any occurrence of the number '3' will get replaced by the color of the edge that the '3' touches. If there is no unique adjacent edge color to replace with, it stays '3'.

### Test Case Application
Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- **Test Case Input**:
    [
    [5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],
    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 4],
    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],
    [5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],
    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4],
    [5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],
    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],
    [5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],
    [5, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4],
    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]

- **Identify '3's and their adjacent edge colors**:
    - First row: '3' is adjacent to '5', so it gets replaced with '5'.
    - Second row: first '3' is adjacent to '5', second '3' is adjacent to '4'.
    - Third row: No '3'.
    - Fourth row: '3' is adjacent to '5'.
    - Fifth row: '3' is adjacent to '4'.
    - Sixth row: '3' is adjacent to '4'.
    - Seventh row: No '3'.
    - Eighth row: '3' is adjacent to '4'.
    - Ninth row: Two '3's; one on left side adjacent to '5', one on right side adjacent to '4'.
    - Tenth row: No '3'.

Based on the rule described above, the output grid would look like this:

Answer: ```

3aa6fb7a,"To figure out the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the examples' inputs and outputs.

In Example 1, we observe that there is a single instance of the color 8 which gets surrounded by zeros on all sides, and it has been changed to 1 in its immediate neighboring cells that are also zeros. This pattern can be seen in the second row and fifth row.

In Example 2, similar to Example 1, we notice the same transformation happening around several occurrences of the color 8. Cells right next to an 8, but only those with a value of 0, are turned into 1.

From these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

- If a cell contains the number 8, change all directly adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that contain 0 to 1.
- Keep all other cells unchanged.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Now, according to the rule:
- All cells that are 0 and directly adjacent to an 8 should become 1.
- Other cells should remain unchanged (i.e., 0 if they are not adjacent to an 8, or 8 if they have the value 8).

Following this rule, the test case grid transforms to:

Output:
```
[
[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8],
[8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8],
[8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1],
[1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
]
```

Therefore, the output for the test case is:

Answer: ```[[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8], [8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1], [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]]```","[[0 0 1 1 0 8 8]

3de23699,"Let's analyze the transformation rule from the examples provided.

Example 1:
Input grid has a pattern that focuses on 4s and 2s. The output grid shows a pattern where only 4s appear in the first and last columns, and 2s appear in the middle column with some padding around them.
Output grid: [
[0, 4, 0],
[4, 4, 4],
[0, 4, 4]]

Example 2:
Input grid includes 3s and 2s. The output grid consists only of 3s and 2s in a smaller matrix. The 3s seem to form an outline while the 2s fill the center.
Output grid: [
[0, 3, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 3, 3, 0, 3],
[3, 0, 0, 3, 0]]

Example 3:
The input grid has 6s and 8s. The output grid contains 6s and 8s arranged to form a diagonal structure.
Output grid: [
[0, 6, 0, 0],
[0, 6, 0, 0],
[6, 6, 6, 0],
[0, 6, 6, 0]]

Example 4:
In this example, both 2s and 3s appear in the input grid. The output grid contains only 2s and 3s in an irregular pattern, but still preserving their relative positions.
Output grid: [
[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]]

Based on these examples, the pattern seems to involve:
- Retaining the non-zero values in the input grid and removing all zeros.
- Keeping the pattern of numbers that appear in the input grid while reducing its size.
- Preserving the structural or visual relationship between the numbers in the input grid within the output grid.

For the test case, we see the numbers 2 and 3 appearing in the grid. We need to retain these numbers and remove the zeros, forming a reduced grid that preserves the structure of these numbers.

Test Case:

From the pattern, it appears that we should remove all zeros and shrink the grid to fit solely the 2s and 3s in their respective locations. The 2s form a vertical line and the 3s form a rectangle.

0d3d703e,"Upon examining the provided examples, we can see that there's a consistent pattern in transforming each number from the input to the output:

- In Example 1, every 3 becomes 4, every 1 becomes 5, and every 2 becomes 6.
- In Example 2, every 2 becomes 6, every 3 becomes 4, and every 8 becomes 9.
- In Example 3, every 5 becomes 1, every 8 becomes 9, and every 6 becomes 2.
- In Example 4, every 9 becomes 8, every 4 becomes 3, and every 2 becomes 6.

From these transformations, we can derive a general rule that each digit in the input is consistently incremented by a certain value to produce the corresponding digit in the output, but with a twist due to the finite set of digits (0-9). It appears that we increment each digit by 3 and if it exceeds 9, we start over from 0.

Applying the same rule to the test case:

Input: 
```[
[8, 1, 3],
[8, 1, 3],
[8, 1, 3]]```

If we increment each digit by 3:
- 8 + 3 = 11 which wraps around to 2 (since 11 - 9 = 2)
- 1 + 3 = 4
- 3 + 3 = 6

So the output would be:
```[
[2, 4, 6],

a9f96cdd,"To analyze the pattern and transformation rules between the input and output grids, let's carefully examine the changes in each of the provided examples:

### Example 1:
- **Input**:
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```

- **Output**:
  ```
  [
  [3, 0, 6, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [8, 0, 7, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```

The `2` at (1,1) in the input has been replaced by a `0` in the output. The numbers `3`, `6`, `8`, and `7` appear only around the original position of `2`. More specifically, the `3` appears to the left, the `6` appears to the right, the `8` appears above, and the `7` appears below.

### Example 2:
- **Input**:
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
  ]
  ```
  
- **Output**:
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```
  
In this case, the `2` at (2,4) in the input is turned into `0` in the output with `3` appearing to its left.

### Example 3:
- **Input**:
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```

- **Output**:
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 8, 0, 7, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```

Here, the `2` at (0,2) turns into `0`, and there are `8` and `7` placed above and below it respectively.

### Example 4:
- **Input**:
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```

- **Output**:
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 6],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 7]
  ]
  ```

Again, the `2` at (1,3) in the input is replaced by `0`, and the numbers `3`, `8`, `6`, and `7` appear to the left, top, right, and bottom positions of the original `2`.

### General Rule Identified:
When a `2` appears in the input grid at a specific location, it is replaced by `0` in the output grid, and `3`, `6`, `8`, and `7` are placed in the locations to the left, right, above and below the original `2` respectively, as long as those positions are within the boundaries of the grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Test Input**:
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```
  
  Here, the `2` is located at (1,4).

- **Transformation**:
  - The value `2` at (1,4) will be replaced by `0`.
  - `3` will be placed to the left of the original `2` (at position (1,3)).
  - `0` will remain in place where no transformation takes effect.
  - `6` will be placed to the right of the original `2` (no room for it, so no placement).
  - `8` will be placed above the original `2` (at position (0,4)).
  - `7` will be placed below the original `2` (at position (2,4)).

Therefore, the output should be:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 7]
]
```

But considering only positions that exist inside the grid, the final output is:
Answer: ``` [[0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7]] ```","[[0 0 0 0 8]
 [0 0 0 3 0]

7fe24cdd,"To deduce the transformation rule applied to the given grids, let's analyze the provided examples.

Firstly, observe that in each case, the output grid has twice the width and height of the input grid.

### Analyzing the Examples

#### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
[
 [8, 5, 0],
 [8, 5, 3],
 [0, 3, 2]
]
```

**Output:**
```
[
 [8, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8],
 [8, 5, 3, 3, 5, 5],
 [0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0],
 [0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0],
 [5, 5, 3, 3, 5, 8],
 [8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 8]
]
```

- The first row of the output is a combination of the first and third row colors of the input, mirrored.
- The second row of the output uses the first row of the input and mirrors it.
- The third row of the output is the second row of the input, then mirrored.
- The fourth row is a repeat of the third row.
- The fifth row is a combination of the second and third row colors of the input, mirrored.
- The sixth row is the first row of the input, mirrored again.

This pattern holds true for other examples too.

#### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
[
 [3, 8, 2],
 [3, 2, 2],
 [8, 5, 2]
]
```

**Output:**
```
[
 [3, 8, 2, 8, 3, 3],
 [3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 8],
 [8, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2],
 [2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 8],
 [8, 2, 5, 2, 2, 3],
 [3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 3]
]
```

Similar observations can be made about this output pattern:

- First row: First and third rows of the input, mirrored.
- Second row: First row colors followed by the second row colors.
- Third row: Second row colors followed by itself.
- Fourth row: A mirroring of the third row.
- Fifth row: Second row colors followed by the third row colors.
- Sixth row: The first row colors mirrored.

#### Example 3:
**Input:**
```
[
 [0, 3, 0],
 [6, 6, 6],
 [3, 0, 3]
]
```

**Output:**
```
[
 [0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0],
 [6, 6, 6, 3, 6, 3],
 [0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0],
 [0, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0],
 [3, 6, 3, 6, 6, 6],
 [0, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0]
]
```

Again, we see the same pattern of combining and mirroring the rows:

- First row: First and third rows of the input, mirrored.
- Second row: First row followed by second row.
- Third row: Second row followed by itself.
- Fourth row: Mirrored third row.
- Fifth row: Second row followed by third row.
- Sixth row: First row mirrored.

### Applying the Pattern to the Test Case

Let's apply the same logic to the test case grid:

**Test Case Input:**
```
[
 [2, 5, 0],
 [2, 5, 1],
 [3, 1, 1]
]
```

Based on the observed pattern, here's how the output should be constructed:

1. **First Row:** Combine the first and third rows of the input, mirrored.
    - Original first row: `[2, 5, 0]`
    - Mirrored third row: `[1, 1, 3]`
    - Combined: `[2, 5, 0, 0, 1, 1]`

2. **Second Row:** First row followed by the second row.
    - First row: `[2, 5, 0]`
    - Second row: `[2, 5, 1]`
    - Combined: `[2, 5, 0, 2, 5, 1]`

3. **Third Row:** Second row followed by itself.
    - Second row: `[2, 5, 1]`
    - Combined: `[2, 5, 1, 2, 5, 1]`

4. **Fourth Row:** Mirror of the third row.
    - Third row: `[2, 5, 1, 2, 5, 1]` (already mirrored)

5. **Fifth Row:** Second row followed by the third row.
    - Second row: [2, 5, 1]
    - Third row: `[3, 1, 1]`
    - Combined: `[2, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1]`

6. **Sixth Row:** First row mirrored.
    - Original first row: `[2, 5, 0]`
    - Mirrored: `[0, 5, 2]`
    - Combined: `[0, 5, 2, 0, 5, 2]`

Putting it all together, the transformed grid looks like this:

```
[
 [2, 5, 0, 0, 1, 1],
 [2, 5, 0, 2, 5, 1],
 [2, 5, 1, 2, 5, 1],
 [2, 5, 1, 2, 5, 1],
 [2, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1],
 [0, 5, 2, 0, 5, 2]
]
```

Thus, the output for the test case is:
Answer: ```[[2, 5, 0, 0, 1, 1], [2, 5, 0, 2, 5, 1], [2, 5, 1, 2, 5, 1], [2, 5, 1, 2, 5, 1], [2, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1], [0, 5, 2, 0, 5, 2]]```","[[2 5 0 0 1 1]
 [2 5 0 2 5 1]
 [2 5 1 2 5 1]
 [2 5 1 2 5 1]
 [2 5 1 3 1 1]
 [0 5 2 0 5 2]]",True,True,0.36
5bd6f4ac,"To determine the transformation rule from the given inputs to their respective outputs, let's analyze the pattern.

Looking at all the training examples:
- In Example 1, the output contains only the ninth column of the input matrix.
- In Example 2, the output contains only the seventh, eighth, and ninth columns of the input matrix.
- In Example 3, the output contains only the seventh, eighth, and ninth columns of the input matrix.
- In Example 4, the output contains only the seventh, eighth, and ninth columns of the input matrix.

From these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves extracting the last three columns of the input grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
[
[6, 9, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 8, 9],
[2, 9, 0, 6, 0, 8, 0, 9, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 2, 0],
[9, 2, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 6, 8],
[7, 7, 4, 0, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 7, 4],
[4, 1, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 9],
[9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
[4, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0]]

Applying the rule:
Extract the last three columns:
[
[6, 8, 9],
[0, 9, 0],
[0, 2, 0],
[0, 6, 8],
[0, 0, 0],
[5, 7, 4],
[0, 0, 9],
[1, 0, 0],
[8, 4, 0]]

The resulting transformed grid is:
Answer: ```[[6, 8, 9], [0, 9, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 6, 8], [0, 0, 0], [5, 7, 4], [0, 0, 9], [1, 0, 0], [8, 4, 0]]```","[[6 8 9]

11852cab,"To solve this puzzle, I need to identify the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the provided examples.

Let's review the pattern:
- In Example 1, the input grid has numbers in rows 2 and 5. The output mirrors these numbers symmetrically along the central axis of the grid in rows 7 and 4 respectively.
- In Example 2, the input grid has numbers in rows 3 and 6. The output mirrors these numbers symmetrically along the central axis of the grid in rows 7 and 4 respectively.
- In Example 3, the input grid has numbers in rows 2 and 5. The output also mirrors these numbers symmetrically along the central axis of the grid in rows 7 and 4 respectively.

From these observations, it appears that the transformation rule is to mirror any colored cells (non-zero) in the top half of the grid downwards, maintaining their color and position relative to the center row.

For the Test Case:
- The colored cells are present in rows 2, 3, 5, and 6.
- Row 3 should mirror into row 7; and row 6 should mirror into row 4. Similarly, row 2 should mirror into row 8, and row 5 should mirror into row 6.

Now I'll apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Output:
The third row `[0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]` will be mirrored in the seventh row.
The sixth row `[0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` will be mirrored in the fourth row.

Therefore, the mirrored test case output becomes:
```

1f876c06,"To solve the test case, I need to understand the transformation rules applied in the previous examples.

Looking at Example 1, it seems that every non-zero element in the input grid is propagated forward to fill the next row's corresponding column, while also filling its immediate neighboring columns (to the left and right) in subsequent rows with the same number.

Example 2 follows the same pattern where each non-zero value spreads downwards and sideways into the adjacent column in the next row.

In Example 3, the same rule applies again - the non-zero elements spread down and outwards to the neighboring columns.

Therefore, based on these three examples, we can conclude that the transformation rule for this problem is:

- For each non-zero number in the grid, propagate this number to the next row in the same column.
- Propagate the number one column to the left and right if those columns are within the bounds of the grid.

Applying this rule to the Test Case, we get the following output:

56ff96f3,"To understand the transformation rule from the input to the output grids, let's analyze the given examples:

- In Example 1, the color `1` and `2` in the input have spread horizontally across to fill up their respective row spaces until meeting another non-zero color or reaching the boundary of that row.
- In Example 2, the color `3` and `7` behave similarly as in Example 1, spreading horizontally across their rows.
- In Example 3, the color `4` also spreads horizontally, filling up the row spaces.
- In Example 4, the color `8` and `6` follow the same pattern.

Based on these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is:
- Each non-zero color in the input grid spreads horizontally to fill the entire row with itself, stopping only at boundaries or other non-zero values.

Let's apply this rule to solve the test case:

Input:
```

[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Applying the rule to the test case:
- In the first row, `8` fills the entire row, so it becomes `[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`.
- In the second row, there is an `8`, which fills its row, so it becomes `[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`.
- Rows 3 and 4 contain no non-zero numbers, so they remain unchanged.
- In the fifth row, `6` fills its row, so it becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]`.
- Row 6 contains no non-zero numbers, so it remains unchanged.
- Row 7 contains no non-zero numbers, so it remains unchanged.
- In the eighth row, there is a `6`, so it fills its row, making it `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]`.
- Rows 9 contains no non-zero numbers, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output grid should look like this:

In Example 1, the color '5' in the input becomes '1' or '2' in the output depending on its vertical position relative to '1' and '2':

- When '5' is vertically between a '1' and a '2', it becomes '1' if closer to '1', and '2' if closer to '2'.
- If '5' is at the top (no '1' above) and a '2' below, it becomes '2'.
- If '5' is at the bottom (no '2' below) and a '1' above, it becomes '1'.

In Example 2, the color '5' becomes '3' or '4' based on the same logic:

- When '5' is vertically between a '3' and a '4', it becomes '3' if closer to '3', and '4' if closer to '4'.
- If '5' is at the top with no '3' above and a '4' below, it becomes '4'.
- If '5' is at the bottom with no '4' below and a '3' above, it becomes '3'.

Applying this rule to the test case, we have '5' becoming either '1' or '8' based on their vertical proximity:

- If '5' has '1' above, it becomes '1'.
- If '5' has '8' below, it becomes '8'.
- If '5' is at the top, it becomes '8'.
- If '5' is at the bottom, it becomes '1'.

Let's process the test case accordingly:

Input:
```

[8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
```


- Row 1: '5' is between '1' and '8', but there is only one '1' above, so '5' becomes '1'.
- Row 2: '5' is between '1' and '8', but there are more '8's below, so '5' becomes '8'.
- Rows 3 to 5: '5' becomes '1' since there are more '1's above.
- Row 6: '5' is between '1' and '8', but there is only one '1' above, so '5' becomes '8'.
- Rows 7 to 12: '5' becomes '8' because there are more '8's below.

f8a8fe49,"To figure out the transformation rule applied from the input grids to the output grids, let's analyze the changes in each example:

In Example 1:
- The '2' blocks have remained in the same positions.
- The '5' blocks have shifted diagonally upwards and leftwards.

In Example 2:
- The '2' blocks have stayed at their positions.
- The '5' blocks moved diagonally upwards and leftwards while spreading across columns where they existed.

Similarly, in Example 3:
- The '2' blocks have stayed at their positions.
- The '5' blocks moved diagonally upwards and leftwards with a similar pattern of spreading.

Based on these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves moving all occurrences of '5' one position up and one position to the left, and filling the bottom-right positions vacated by '5' with '0'. If the '5' moves beyond the bounds of the grid, it will not appear in the output.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:
- All '5's will move one row up and one column to the left.
- Any '5' that would move outside the grid boundaries will simply disappear.

Let's perform the transformation on the Test Case:
1. Move all '5's up and left.
2. Fill the vacated spots with '0'.

b2862040,"To solve the given test case, I need to understand the transformation rule applied to the provided examples.

Upon analyzing the examples, it appears that whenever there is an isolated '1' surrounded by '9's on all sides or when there is a '1' next to another '1' but not surrounded completely by '9's, the '1' gets transformed into an '8'. It seems the rule applies to any single '1' that does not have a '1' directly above, below, left, or right of itself.

For example:
- In Example 1, the '1' in the third row and second column becomes an '8'.
- In Example 2, the '1's in the fifth and sixth rows, third column become '8's.
- In Example 3, the '1's in third, fourth, and fifth rows, seventh column become '8's, and so on.

Applying this understanding to the test case:

We can see that some isolated '1's need to change to '8'. Particularly in the middle of the grid where they are fully or partially surrounded by '9', but not connected directly to another '1'. Also, the '1's in the first row that are not part of a larger group get changed to '8'.

8e5a5113,"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the transformation rule applied in the given examples.

In Example 1:
- The input has zeros, and when zeros are present, they seem to get replaced by the numbers around them.
- More specifically, the zero in the first row gets replaced by the number to its left (4) and right (1).
- In subsequent rows, zeros get replaced by the numbers directly above them and to their immediate left and right in that row.

Applying the same logic to Example 2 and Example 3, we see similar replacements:

In Example 2:
- Zeros are replaced by the numbers surrounding them.

In Example 3:
- Zeros also follow the same replacement rule.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be: replace each zero with the average value of the numbers immediately above, below, to the left, and to the right of it, rounding down if necessary. If no such numbers exist, use those available.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[3, 3, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[9, 9, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[2, 9, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
]```

Step-by-step transformation:
- For each zero, find the numbers directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of it.
- Replace the zero with the floor value of the average of these numbers.

Row 1:
- First zero: replaced by the average of 3, 3, 9, 5 (floor((3+3+9+5)/4)) = floor(5) = 5.
- Second zero: replaced by the average of 9, 9, 5, 5 (floor((9+9+5+5)/4)) = floor(7) = 7.
- Third zero: replaced by the average of 9, 5, 5, 0 (floor((9+5+5+0)/4)) = floor(4.5) = 4.
- Fourth zero: replaced by the average of 5, 5, 0, 0 (floor((5+5+0+0)/4)) = floor(2.5) = 2.
- Last zero: replaced by the average of 0, 0, 5, 5 (floor((5+5)/2)) = floor(5) = 5.

Row 2:
- First zero: replaced by the average of 9, 9, 9, 9 (floor((9+9+9+9)/4) = floor(9) = 9.
- Second zero: replaced by the average of 9, 9, 5, 5 (floor((9+9+5+5)/4)) = floor(7) = 7.
- Third zero: replaced by the average of 9, 5, 5, 9 (floor((9+9+5+5)/4)) = floor(7) = 7.
- Fourth zero: replaced by the average of 5, 5, 5, 5 (floor((5+5+5+5)/4)) = floor(5) = 5.
- Last zero: replaced by the average of 5, 5, 5, 5 (floor((5+5+5+5)/4)) = floor(5) = 5.

Row 3:
- First zero: replaced by the average of 2, 9, 9, 9 (floor((2+9+9+9)/4)) = floor(6.75) = 6.
- Second zero: replaced by the average of 9, 9, 5, 9 (floor((9+9+5+9)/4)) = floor(8.25) = 8.
- Third zero: replaced by the average of 9, 5, 9, 9 (floor((9+9+5+9)/4)) = floor(8.25) = 8.
- Fourth zero: replaced by the average of 5, 9, 9, 5 (floor((5+9+9+5)/4)) = floor(7) = 7.
- Last zero: replaced by the average of 5, 5, 9, 6 (floor((5+6+9+5)/4)) = floor(6.5) = 6.

So, the transformed test case would be:

Example 1:
Input: 
```
[
[2, 2, 1],
[1, 5, 1],
[5, 2, 2]]
```

Output:
```
[
[2, 1, 5],
[2, 5, 2],
[1, 1, 2]]
```

Observation: The first output row is the second input row flipped horizontally. The second output row is the third input row flipped horizontally. The third output row is the first row of the input grid.

Example 2:
Input: 
```
[
[2, 2, 5],
[6, 2, 2],
[5, 5, 5]]
```

Output:
```
[
[2, 6, 5],
[2, 2, 5],
[5, 5, 2]]
```

Observation: The first output row is the second input row shifted one position right and the last number moves to the front. The second output row is the third input row. The third output row is the first input row shifted one position left and the first number moves to the end.

Example 3:
Input: 
```
[
[9, 9, 5],
[5, 5, 8],
[5, 8, 9]]
```

Output:
```
[
[9, 5, 5],
[5, 8, 5],
[9, 9, 5]]
```

Observation: This example also follows a similar shifting pattern. The first output row is formed by moving the middle element of the first input row to the beginning, the second output row is formed by moving the last element of the second input row to the front, and the third output row is formed by moving the middle element of the third input row to the end.

Example 4:
Input: 
```
[
[2, 6, 6],
[2, 1, 1],
[2, 6, 2]]
```

Output:
```
[
[2, 2, 2],
[6, 1, 6],
[6, 1, 2]]
```

Observation: The first output row consists of the first column elements from the input rows. The second output row consists of the second column elements from the input rows. The third output row consists of the third column elements from the input rows.

From these observations, we can see that there isn't a uniform simple operation applied across all the examples. However, considering the fourth example as a pattern, it seems to be a transpose operation where rows become columns and columns become rows. 

I will apply this transformation to the test case:

Test Case:
Input:
```
[
[9, 3, 4],
[9, 4, 4],
[9, 3, 4]]
```

Following the transpose rule:

9565186b,"To determine the transformation rule from the input to the output based on the provided examples, let's closely analyze how each number in the input grid changes.

Looking at the examples, we notice that:

1. The number `1` in the input grid changes to `5` in the output grid.
2. The number `8` in the input grid also changes to `5` in the output grid.
3. All other numbers (`2`, `3`, `4`) remain unchanged in the output grid.

The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- If an element in the input grid is `1` or `8`, transform it into `5`.
- Keep all other elements unchanged.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Input Test Case:
```
[
[1, 3, 2],
[3, 3, 2],
[1, 3, 2]
```

Following our identified rule:
- Each `1` should be replaced with `5`.
- The numbers `3` and `2` remain unchanged.
- There are no `8`s in this grid, so none of them need to change.

Therefore, the transformation of the test case would look like:

Output Test Case:
```
[
[5, 3, 2],
[3, 3, 2],
[5, 3, 2]
```

So, the solution to the test case is:

e9afcf9a,"To determine the transformation rule that changes the input grids into their corresponding outputs, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: 
   - Input: 
     ```
     [
     [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
     [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]]

   - Output:

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
     [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8],
     [8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4]]
     ```

In both examples, we observe the following patterns:
- The input consists of two rows where each row has the same value.
- In the output, there are two rows, but the value alternates between the two different numbers present in the input.

From this observation, we can deduce the transformation rule:
- Swap the two colors between the two rows.
- Alternate the values within each row starting with the first row's color at the beginning.

Let's apply this rule to the Test Case:

- Input:
  ```
  [
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]
  ```

- Applying the rule:
  - First row starts with 6 and alternates with 2.
  - Second row starts with 2 and alternates with 6.

So, the Test Case would transform to:
```
[
[6, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2],
[2, 6, 2, 6, 2, 6]]
```

Therefore, the answer for the test case is:

ddf7fa4f,"To find the transformation rule, let's compare the input and output grids in each training example:

- In Example 1, any '5' in the input becomes '2' in the output, and any '5' in column 7 and onwards become '8' in the output.
- In Example 2, the '5' throughout the block transforms into '1' on the left side and '7' on the right side while keeping the zeros intact at the boundaries.
- In Example 3, similarly, '5' turns into '1' on the left side and '6' on the right side maintaining the zero boundary condition.

Based on these observations, we can derive a rule that applies to the test case:
1. Any '0' remains unchanged.
2. For any 'N' where N is not '0', if there is an unbroken continuous sequence of this number, and the first occurrence of the number is in the left part of the matrix, all occurrences of this number within the sequence become '1'.
3. If the first occurrence of the number is in the right part of the matrix, all occurrences of this number within the sequence become '9'.

Note: The right part of the matrix starts from column 7 and onwards as seen in the third example.

Applying this rule to the test case, numbers '5' to the left of column 7 become '1' and those to the right of column 7 become '9'.

4c5c2cf0,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's analyze the changes in the provided examples:

The first thing to notice is that zeros remain unchanged. The second observation is that numbers are being replicated or mirrored along the vertical axis, with additional zeros filling the gaps.

Example 1 Input to Output:
- The number 2s are replicated from their original positions across the vertical axis of symmetry, which appears to be around the 4th column.
- The number 4s behave similarly but have their own unique symmetry axis around the 7th column.
- The replication/mirroring is done such that the value on each side of the axis is filled with the same value, with zeros used to fill any empty spaces caused by this mirroring.

Example 2 Input to Output:
- The process is the same here. The number 8s are replicated symmetrically around the 5th column, and number 3s around the 6th column.

Example 3 Input to Output:
- Here, number 1s are replicated around the 3rd column, and number 8s around the 5th column, while number 4s around the 7th column. Again, zeros fill the rest of the grid where needed after replication.

Based on these observations, here’s the pattern:
1. Identify all non-zero numbers and their positions.
2. Mirror those numbers around a central axis (usually in the middle of the grid).
3. Fill in any gaps with zeros.

Given the size of the test case, the central axis for mirroring would appear to be the 7th column. Let's apply this rule to the test case:

b91ae062,"To solve this problem, let's analyze the transformation applied to the input grids in order to produce the corresponding output grids.

In all the given examples, we notice that the output grids are larger than the input grids and contain repetitions of the original color values. Specifically, each non-zero value appears twice as many times horizontally and vertically as it does in the input grid. Additionally, we observe that the size of the output grid is a square matrix with a side length equal to twice the longest dimension (either height or width) of the input grid.

For Example 1:
- The input is 3x3.
- The output is 6x6.
- Each non-zero number is repeated twice in both dimensions.

For Example 2:
- The input is 3x3.
- The output is 6x6.
- Same pattern of repetition applies.

For Example 3:
- The input is 3x3.
- The output is 9x9, which matches the criteria since the longest dimension is 3, making the output dimension 2*3 = 6 but rounded up to the nearest perfect square, which is 9.
- Each non-zero number is repeated three times in both dimensions.

For Example 4:
- The input is 3x3.
- The output is 9x9.
- Same pattern of repetition applies.

For Example 5:
- The input is 3x4.
- The output is 8x12, which matches the criteria since the longest dimension is 4, making the output dimension 2*4 = 8 but rounded up to the nearest perfect square, which is actually a rectangle of 8x12.
- Each non-zero number is repeated twice in both dimensions for 3x4 inputs.

Following this pattern, let's apply the same transformation to the test case.
The test case has a 3x3 input matrix.

Since the longest dimension of the test case is 3, we will double it and round up to get a 6x6 output grid. 

We will repeat each non-zero value in both dimensions:
