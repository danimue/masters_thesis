75b8110e,"To find the transformation rule that generates the output from the input, we need to observe patterns in how the output grids are derived from the input grids across different examples.

In all the provided examples, the output grid size is smaller than the input grid size. Also, the numbers in the input grids seem to be condensed and rearranged in such a way that it captures essential components from the input.

By observing the input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation involves extracting and reorganizing specific numbers (non-zero) from each quadrant of the input grid to form the output grid. Each quadrant of the input grid (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) seems to contribute to one row of the output grid.

Let's break it down for the test case using this logic:

Test Case Input:
```python
[
[0, 4, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5],
[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[6, 0, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0],
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9],
[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]]
```

Divide into quadrants:
- Top left: 
```python
[[0, 4], [0, 4]]
```
- Top right: 
```python
[[4, 5], [4, 5]]
```
- Bottom left: 
```python
[[6, 0], [0, 0]]
```
- Bottom right: 
```python
[[9, 9], [9, 0]]
```

Extracting non-zero values from each quadrant and organizing them as per the observed pattern:
- From top-left: `[4, 4]`
- From top-right: `[4, 5]`
- From bottom-left: `[6, 6]`
- From bottom-right: `[9, 9]`

Combining these values into a 4x4 grid according to the pattern seen in the examples:
```python
[
[4, 5, 6, 9],
[4, 5, 6, 9],
[4, 5, 0, 6],
[0, 5, 6, 9]
]
```

Therefore, solving the test case yields the following output grid:
Answer: ``` [[4, 5, 6, 9], [4, 5, 6, 9], [4, 5, 0, 6], [0, 5, 6, 9]] ```","[[4 5 6 9]
 [4 5 6 9]
 [4 5 0 6]
 [0 5 6 9]]",True,True,0.19
3618c87e,"To solve the test case, I will follow the transformation rules observed in the training examples.

The pattern that emerges is as follows:

1. All zeros remain unchanged.
2. The row containing the '1' and the row containing the '5' swap positions for the cells in the middle column only (columns where the '1' and '5' are present).
3. The top two rows are always filled with zeros, regardless of their original content.

Let's apply these rules to the test case provided.

Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 5, 0, 5],
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]
```

Following the transformation rules, we get:

Output:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 5, 0, 5],
[5, 5, 1, 5, 1]]
```

This transformation swaps the '1' and '5' elements in the third and fourth rows while ensuring the first two rows stay all zeros.

Answer: ``` [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 1, 5, 1]] ```","[[0 0 0 0 0]

3ac3eb23,"Based on the training examples provided, the transformation rule seems to be that non-zero elements in the first row of the input grid are copied to alternate rows starting from the second row, with a horizontal shift by one position to the right.

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

The output should be:
```

3c9b0459,"To solve this puzzle, I'll look for patterns that transform the inputs into their corresponding outputs. After analyzing the provided examples, the transformation rule seems to be a clockwise rotation of the corners of the grid while keeping the center element and other elements in place if the grid size allows such a rotation.

Given the examples:

- Example 1's transformation rotates the corners 1, 2, 8, 2 clockwise.
- Example 2 does the same with corners 9, 2, 2, 9.
- Example 3 swaps 8, 5, 8, 5, although it's the same number, it follows the pattern.
- Example 4 rotates 3, 2, 9, 3.

For the test case:

Input:
```
[
[6, 4, 4],
[6, 6, 4],
[4, 6, 7]
]
```

The corner elements are 6, 4, 7, 4. Rotating these clockwise, we get 4, 6, 4, 6 respectively. Thus, the first row becomes [4, 4, 6], the second row stays the same since the center remains untouched [6, 6, 4], and the last row becomes [6, 6, 7].

ba97ae07,"The pattern in this transformation involves replacing certain areas of the grid with a uniform color. Based on the examples provided:

- The interior area surrounded by a particular color is replaced with that same surrounding color.
- This applies to any solid block surrounded by a different color.

Given this understanding, let's apply it to the test case where there is a central block of 4s surrounded by alternating rows of 0s and 5s. We'll replace the 4s with the surrounding color, which alternates between 0s and 5s.

Following the rule:

```python

846bdb03,"To produce the output from the input, the transformation rule involves extracting a specific subgrid centered on a region of non-zero elements. Then, the extracted subgrid is resized or cropped such that its dimensions become smaller and only the essential parts with non-zero elements are retained. From the examples provided, it's evident that the output subgrid is usually half-sized (width and height) compared to the input grid, though not exactly symmetrical in cropping.

For the test case:
The input grid contains a central block of non-zero elements surrounded by zeros. The pattern resembles the other examples where the non-zero elements form a more compact shape within a larger zero-padded space. By applying the observed transformation rule of focusing on the area with non-zero elements and reducing its size:

10fcaaa3,"To solve the given transformation rule, we can break down the pattern from the training examples:

1. **Expansion of Columns:** Each column in the original grid gets expanded into two columns in the transformed grid. This expansion is achieved by duplicating each column, but inserting `8`s in between the duplicated columns except where there's an existing non-zero value.

2. **Horizontal Mirroring:** After expanding the columns, the rows containing only zeros get mirrored horizontally. This means that for every row containing only zeros, the row above it will be copied to below while inserting `8`s as separators.

Let's apply these rules step-by-step to the provided test case:

Input:
```python
[
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]]
```

### Step 1: Expand Columns
First, we expand columns with the insertion of `8` between them.
```python
[
[0, 8, 3, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
[0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 8, 0],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
[0, 8, 3, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]]
```

### Step 2: Horizontal Mirroring
Next, we mirror rows with only zeros horizontally.
```python
[
[0, 8, 3, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],

d9f24cd1,"To find the rule, let's compare the inputs and outputs of the training examples.

In both example inputs and outputs, we see some changes:
- The value `2` appears more frequently in the output than in the input.
- The pattern of `2`s seems to form a ""wall"" around the non-zero numbers (`5`), with the exception that they do not overwrite the `5` values.

Based on this observation, the transformation rule seems to be:
- For every cell which isn't a `5`, set it to `2`.
- Keep any `5` values as they are.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

234bbc79,"To find the transformation rule applied from input to output in the provided examples, we observe that the inputs and outputs exhibit a reduction in width and some changes in the color distribution. Upon closer inspection, it appears the rule involves taking every other cell in the input grid and mapping it to a new, narrower grid with specific changes to certain values.

After analyzing the training examples, the observed pattern is:

- Taking every second column from the input grid.
- Any occurrence of `5` becomes `2`, `1` remains as `1`, and `8` becomes `6`. Other numbers remain unchanged.

Applying this rule to the test case, we can produce the following solution:

f5b8619d,"To solve the provided test case, let's first analyze the pattern in the transformation rules based on the training examples:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The size of the output grid is always twice the dimensions of the input grid.
   - It appears that for every element in the original grid, there are corresponding elements in the output grid that replicate the structure, but with additional patterns involving the color `8`.
   - Specifically, if a non-zero value exists at an index in the input grid, this value is replicated in the output grid following a mirrored pattern, whereas zeros are filled with the color `8`.

2. **Applying the Transformation Rule**:
   Given these observations, we apply the transformation rule to the test case input grid.

**Test Case Input**:
``` 
[
[0, 0, 3, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 3],
[3, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Following the observed pattern, we can generate the output grid as follows:

- The `3`s will appear in the mirrored locations.
- All `0`s will turn into `8`s except where the `3` needs to be placed.

**Step-by-step construction**:

Starting with the top-left quadrant of the output grid:
```
[
[8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
[8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3],
[3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8],
```

Then continuing with the bottom-right quadrant mirroring the above construction (with the `3`s appropriately placed):
```
[8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
[8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3],

- When a `0` in the input becomes a `2` or `3` in the output, it's often surrounded by `5`s.
- When `0`s form a connected component, they are all replaced by a single number (`1`, `2`, or `3`).
- The choice of which number (`1`, `2`, or `3`) to use for a connected component of `0`s seems to vary somewhat arbitrarily but consistently across different components within the same grid.

In each example, the transformation seems to replace certain numbers with zeros to create a pattern where non-zero numbers form a specific shape within the grid, often resembling a hollow or bordered shape around the edges.

In the first example, all the surrounding 4s of the 5s are replaced by 0s, creating a hollow square.
In the second example, the transformation creates a pattern where the inner 5s are turned into 0s, forming a hollow cross.
In the third example, the middle 5s in the 9s grid are replaced by 0s, resulting in a hollow cross shape.

For the test case, we notice similar patterns: the number 5 appears to define the core shape to be preserved while the number 3 surrounds it. We apply the rule by replacing the 3s on the inside that do not form the border with 0s.

Thus, for the test case, we keep the outer 3s intact and change the inner 3s inside the 5s to 0s.

9dfd6313,"To deduce the transformation rule, we can examine how the numbers changed from the input to the output in all the provided examples.

1. In all examples, we notice that the number `5` has a significant role. It appears that every `5` remains in its place, and other numbers seem to move toward the `5`s.
2. Observing the movement pattern, it seems that numbers move towards the nearest `5`, filling up from left to right and top to bottom until a `5` is met in the row or column.
3. If a number moves into a position where there's already another number, it seems to take the position only if it's empty (which is inferred from the examples).

From these observations, let's apply the rule to the test case:

Given Test Case:
```
[
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],
[2, 0, 8, 8, 5, 0],
[2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]]
```

Applying the transformation rule:
- Numbers move towards the nearest `5`.
- Positions fill up from left to right and top to bottom, avoiding collisions with other numbers.

Following this pattern:
```
[
[5, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2],  // 3s and 2s move towards the `5` in the first row
[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],  // no change except for the 0s around 5
[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],  // 5 remains, 0s stay
[0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 8],  // 8s move towards the `5` in the fourth row
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 6],  // 6 moves towards the `5` in the fifth row
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]]  // 5 stays, 0s stay
```

So the final answer is:
```python
Answer: [[5, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]]

25ff71a9,"The transformation rule applied to the input grids appears to be a downward shift of the non-zero rows. Specifically, all rows with at least one non-zero element are moved down to fill any rows directly below them that contain only zeros, while maintaining their relative order. Rows that are already filled with zeros stay at the top.

Using this rule on the test case:

Test Input:

Applying the transformation:
- Both rows with non-zero elements (rows containing 2) move down to fill the bottom row.
- The top row, which was originally zero, stays unchanged at the top.

ae3edfdc,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the transformation rules applied in the previous examples.

1. The transformation seems to shift non-zero elements up, down, left, or right until they reach the edge of the grid.
2. Specifically, it appears that any non-zero element ""falls"" or ""slides"" into empty space (cells with value 0) until blocked by another non-zero element or the edge of the grid. The direction can vary but seems to follow a gravity-like pull towards the nearest edge.

d4a91cb9,"Based on the training examples provided, the transformation rule appears to be as follows:

1. Identify non-zero cells in the grid.
2. For each identified non-zero cell, fill the entire row and column with half its value, rounding down if necessary. If the original value is 8, the new value for the row and column would be 4.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

The test case has two non-zero cells: one 8 and one 2.

- For the 8 at [8][3], we fill column 3 and row 8 with 4s.
- For the 2 at [2][11], we fill column 11 and row 2 with 1s.

4be741c5,"To derive the transformation rule, let's examine the provided examples:

1. In Example 1, we see three regions with distinct color blocks that form a sequence: [4, 2, 8]. The output reduces this grid to a single row with one cell from each different color block.

2. Example 2 has three unique color blocks in vertical succession: [2], then [8], and finally [5]. The output here reflects each distinct color block vertically.

3. In Example 3, the blocks appear in the order [6, 4, 2, 3] vertically, and the output is an array representing each color block as a separate row.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each unique color block present in the input grid, retain one instance of the color in the output.
- Arrange these instances in the order they appear vertically (from top to bottom).

Applying this rule to the Test input:

In the test case, the colors appear in the following order from top to bottom:
- Color 3 forms the largest uppermost block
- Color 2 forms the middle block
- Color 1 forms the next block below
- Color 8 is at the bottom

Thus, our output should contain a row for each color in the order they appear.

4612dd53,"To solve the test case, let's analyze the transformation pattern from the input to the output in the training examples. Notice that the transformation appears to alternate between `1` and `2` where there was originally a `1`. However, the `2`s do not replace all `1`s; instead, they seem to fill spaces between `1`s on the same row or column but only in specific positions that follow a certain rule.

From observing the patterns, it appears that the transformation rule for `2`s is:

- If a `1` is surrounded by empty space (i.e., `0`), it remains `1`.
- If a `1` is adjacent to another `1` horizontally or vertically, the space between them gets a `2`, depending on the arrangement.

Based on these rules, we can apply the transformation to the test case provided.

Let's analyze the test case step-by-step and fill in the `2`s accordingly:

995c5fa3,"To derive the solution for the test case, we need to identify the pattern or rule applied from the initial grid to the resulting grid in all provided examples.

Looking at the training examples, it can be observed that the transformation involves reducing the dimensions of the grid and changing the values according to certain positions' patterns within the larger grid. 

Each output grid is a 3x3 grid, suggesting that the transformation rule might involve collapsing the larger grid into a smaller one based on some specific criteria.

Analyzing the changes between the inputs and the outputs:

1. Each column of the output seems to be derived from the entire column of the input grid, considering only the non-zero entries.
2. The value in each cell of the output is different in every example, indicating there's likely a unique algorithm per entry based on the pattern and sequence of numbers within the columns and possibly rows of the input grid.

After careful examination, the pattern appears to be based on the count of non-zero numbers in specific segments of the input grid, followed by a transformation that maps these counts to the corresponding numbers in the output grid. However, due to the lack of a clear numerical or direct positional mapping rule without additional context, the exact rule must be inferred from the given outcomes.

Given the complexity and the need for accurate inference, the final step is to apply whatever inferred rule to the test case input grid to produce the expected output.

For this test case:
Input:
```
[
[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],

[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]

Following the patterns observed in previous examples, the solution would be:
Answer: ```[[8, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4]]```","[[8 8 8]

6d0aefbc,"To solve the puzzle, let's observe the pattern from the provided examples.

In every example, the output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid along both the vertical and horizontal axes. This means that:

- Each row in the output is symmetric with respect to its middle.
- Each column in the output is also symmetric with respect to its middle.

Let’s apply this rule to our test case:

Test Case: Input
```[
[6, 8, 6],
[8, 6, 8],
[1, 6, 1]]
```

To generate the output, we will mirror each row and then append the mirrored rows to the original rows.

For row [6, 8, 6]:
- Mirrored row: [6, 8, 6]
- Combined row: [6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 6]

For row [8, 6, 8]:
- Mirrored row: [8, 6, 8]
- Combined row: [8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8]

For row [1, 6, 1]:
- Mirrored row: [1, 6, 1]
- Combined row: [1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1]

This gives us the first half of the output. Now we append these combined rows mirrored vertically to get the full output grid.

The final output after mirroring vertically:
```[
[6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 6],
[8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8],
[1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1],
[1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1],

ce4f8723,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the pattern or rule applied from the input to the output in the training examples. Observing the changes:

- The first four rows of the input grids contain a mix of 0s and 1s.
- The fifth row in all cases consists of the number 4 repeated.
- The sixth and onward rows have a mix of 0s and 2s.

In each transformation, the number 1 in the top part of the input is transformed into 3, while 0s become either 0 or 3 based on their position relative to the numbers around them. The middle row of 4s disappears, and the bottom rows with 2s transform into a similar pattern but with 3s instead of 1s.

Based on these observations, let's apply the same rule to our test case.

The test input is:
```plaintext
[
[1, 0, 1, 0],
[1, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 1, 0],

[2, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 2, 0, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 0]]
```

Transforming according to the observed pattern:
```plaintext
[
[3, 3, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 3],
[0, 3, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 3]]
```

Applying the rule to the 2s in the lower half:
- All the 2s become 3s, and 0s stay as 0s.

Thus, the complete transformation for the test case is:
```plaintext
[
[3, 3, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 3],
[0, 3, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 0],
[0, 3, 0, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 0]]

928ad970,"To solve the puzzle, let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:

1. The number `5` remains unchanged in all examples.
2. The transformation appears to include expanding certain regions with specific numbers outward, creating borders or filling gaps with that number.

For instance, in Example 1, the region with `1`s is expanded upwards, downwards, and sideways, forming a larger rectangle while maintaining the original shape intact. The `5` remains untouched throughout.

Following this pattern, we can apply the same logic to the Test case:

- The `8`s are present in a block-like shape.
- We need to expand the `8`s around their current positions without changing the `5`s.
- This expansion should form a larger rectangle around the `8`s, keeping the same principle as observed in the examples.

af902bf9,"To deduce the rule applied to generate the output from the input, let's compare the provided input and output examples:

1. In all examples, there are specific cells that change their value from `0` to `2`. This suggests that these cells are being filled with color `2`.
2. The pattern of cells being filled with `2` often occurs between pairs of `4`s in the vertical or horizontal direction. Cells directly between `4`s seem to get filled with `2`.

Given this observation, we can apply the same transformations to the test case.

- We have `4`s at positions (0, 5), (0, 9), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 3), (8, 0), and (8, 3).
- Based on the patterns from the previous examples, cells that need to be filled with `2` would be those that are horizontally or vertically between these `4`s.

Applying this to the test case:

```python

Observing the transitions from input to output in the training examples, it seems the following transformation occurs:

1. The output grid dimensions are smaller than the input grid. Specifically, if the input grid has dimensions \( M \times N \), then the output grid usually has dimensions \( \frac{M}{2} \times \frac{N}{2} \) or similar reduction.
2. The output grid appears to be a summarized version of the input grid where corner and edge elements of segments within the input grid are preserved but often consolidated.

Given the observations, the input for the test case is a \( 10 \times 10 \) grid, so we can expect an output grid of approximately \( 5 \times 5 \) or a further reduced dimension.

cbded52d,"To transform the input into the output, the rule appears to be that if an element in the second column (index 1) of a row differs from the element in the sixth column (index 5) of the same row and both of these columns have non-zero values, then the value in the sixth column should match the value in the second column.

Applying this transformation to the test case:

Transforming based on the rule:
- In the second row, the second column has '8' and the sixth column has '0', so update the sixth column to '8'.
- In the seventh row, the second column has '1' and the sixth column has '0', so update the sixth column to '1'.

49d1d64f,"To solve the test case, first, observe the pattern in transforming the input grids to output grids from the training examples:

- The output grid size becomes larger than the original (input) by adding one row at the top and bottom, and one column at the start and end.
- The new outermost row and column have `0` values except where they touch the corners of the original grid. 
- Each cell's value in the interior part of the output grid (not the border of zeros) repeats twice horizontally and vertically.

Applying these rules to the test case provided:

Test Case Input:

1. Create a new grid that is larger by adding borders of zeros.
2. Populate the new grid with the duplicated values according to the pattern observed.

c8cbb738,"To solve the given puzzle, we need to identify the transformation rule based on the provided examples. Observing the examples, it seems that the transformation involves reducing the dimensions of the input grid while maintaining the relative positions of non-background elements (where the background color is the most common element in the initial grid).

In the first example, the background color is `3`. The output is created by keeping only the elements that are not `3` and adjusting their positions to maintain their relative locations. This involves selecting every other row and column, starting from the first row and column containing non-background elements.

Applying the same logic to our test case:

1. The background color is `8`.
2. We'll keep all the elements that are not `8`, and reduce the grid size by considering every other row and column.
3. The first row containing non-background elements is row 2, and the first column is column 6.
4. Thus, the resulting grid will contain elements from rows 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., and columns 6, 8, 10, ..., where we take only those elements that are not `8`.

Observations from training examples:
- The resulting grid is always a 3x3 matrix.
- The presence of certain numbers (like 6) in specific positions relative to the number 8 in the input grid seems to influence the value in the output grid.

Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the output grid is derived from checking the presence of the color 6 in three vertical segments and three horizontal segments within the larger grid. If a 6 appears in any column/row that overlaps with the segment in question, the corresponding cell in the output becomes 1; otherwise, it remains 0.

1b2d62fb,"To solve the puzzle, we need to find a pattern or rule that applies to all provided examples.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identifying the common pattern**:
   - All inputs have the number `1` in column 3.
   - The size of the output matrix is smaller than that of the input matrix. Specifically, the output matrix width is reduced to 3 columns.
   - In the output, the value `8` appears only at specific positions. It seems that these positions are derived from certain patterns related to the column containing the value `1`.

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The output matrix is essentially a reduction of the input where the column 3 of the original matrix (where `1` appears) is mapped into a transformed representation.
   - In the output, the `8`s seem to appear in places corresponding to some transformation rule applied to the original columns around the `1` column.

3. **Transformation Rule**:
   - We observe that the column containing `1` is used to determine the pattern of `8`s in the output. Columns adjacent to the `1` (i.e., columns 2 and 4) influence whether an `8` appears in the output. If any of those columns contain non-zero values, an `8` is placed at the respective position.

4. **Applying the Rule to Test Case**:
   - Given the test case:
     ```
     [
     [9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0],
     [0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0],
     [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 0, 9],
     [0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 9, 9]
     ]
     ```
   - Column 3 has zeros, so the first column of the output will be zeros.
   - Columns 2 and 4 surrounding the `1` (columns 3 and 5) contain non-zero values in most rows, implying that `8` will appear in those positions.

Let's construct the output based on this understanding:
- The output should be 5x3 (same height as the input, width reduced to 3).
- The first column should be all zeros.
- The second and third columns should have `8`s where the corresponding entries in columns 2 and 4 of the input are non-zero.

### Constructing the Answer:
```python
Answer: [[0, 8, 0], 
         [0, 8, 0], 
         [0, 8, 0], 
         [0, 8, 8], 
         [0, 8, 0]]
```

This solution reflects the derived rule that `8`s are placed in the output where the adjacent columns to the central column with `1` have non-zero values.",,False,False,0.0
d511f180,"To find the transformation rule, I analyzed how numbers changed from the inputs to the outputs in the examples provided:

1. In Example 1, observe that some numbers seem to change to another number, specifically the number 5 changes to 8, and vice versa.
2. In Example 2, again we see the number 5 changes to 8, and 8 changes to 5.
3. In Example 3, the same pattern is observed where 5 and 8 swap places.

From these observations, the rule can be summarized as follows: Swap all instances of the number 5 with the number 8, and all instances of the number 8 with the number 5 within the grid.

Applying this transformation to the Test grid:

Original:
```python
[

09629e4f,"To solve the test case, we need to understand the transformation applied in the examples. Observing the patterns:

- There are rows filled entirely with 5's that seemingly act as separators.
- Above and below these separator rows, blocks of numbers fill up entire columns or rows, replacing the original numbers.

The pattern seems to involve filling contiguous blocks of the same number within each section above and below the row of 5's. Each block of numbers is replaced with one single number throughout its vertical or horizontal extent.

ce9e57f2,"To deduce the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids:

1. The first row and column of zeros remain unchanged.
2. In the input, the number `2` appears in specific patterns, and in the output, it either remains `2` or gets transformed into `8`.
3. Transformations seem to occur diagonally, starting from the second row onwards, where the `2` values begin to alternate with `8`. This alternation happens when there are consecutive `2`s in the columns and rows that meet certain criteria.

For the test case provided, we need to apply this rule:

- If a `2` appears in a position and the pattern of `2`s around it meets the criteria for transformation (which seems to be based on the diagonal continuity of `2`s), the `2` will transform to `8`.

Applying this logic to the test case:

- In Example 1, the center area (row 5 and 6 columns 2 to 5) which was initially empty (0s) got filled with the color 8.
- In Example 2, the central vertical strip (columns 5 to 7) which was initially empty (0s) got filled with the color 8.
- In Example 3, the middle area (rows 4 through 7, columns 4 through 7) which was initially empty (0s) got filled with the color 8.

From these observations, it seems that the transformation rule involves filling an empty central region with the color 8.

Analyzing the Test Case, we see that there's an empty region at the bottom right (rows 7 through 9, columns 8 through 10). Therefore, the transformation should fill this region with the color 8.

a3df8b1e,"To solve this puzzle, we observe a pattern in the transformation applied to the input grids to produce the output grids. In each of the training examples, there's a single '1' somewhere in the grid, which then dictates how the rest of the grid is transformed into alternating patterns.

For each example:

- A '1' exists at one point in the grid.
- The remaining cells are filled with alternating patterns of '1' and '0', starting from the row where the '1' is found and propagating upwards. Each column alternates its pattern independently based on the position of the '1'.
  
The pattern repeats cyclically with a period determined by the number of columns in the grid. For instance, if the grid has two columns, the pattern for one row might look like `[1, 0]`, followed by `[0, 1]` and so on. With three columns, a possible cycle could be `[1, 0, 0]`, `[0, 1, 0]`, `[0, 0, 1]`.

Given the test case, the `1` is placed in the last row of the first column and the grid has five columns. We can deduce that the pattern will start from that position and propagate upwards with an alternating sequence across the five columns.

So, the solution for the test case should fill the grid according to the alternating pattern starting from the position of the '1' and cycling through all five columns.

b0c4d837,"To solve this puzzle, I analyzed the pattern in which the outputs are generated from the inputs. Each input grid seems to have a specific section of interest that contains a ""core"" pattern (5s and 8s) surrounded by 0s. The output is formed by taking the central part that contains mostly 8s and 5s, trimming away any outer layer of zeros, and adjusting the size to fit a 3x3 grid.

The rule appears to be extracting the largest contiguous block of numbers that contains at least one ""8"" and trimming anything outside this block to form a 3x3 output grid. If there's an ""8"", it takes precedence over ""5"" for the core area.

For the given test case, the central part containing the 8s and 5s forms a block with 8s in the middle. Here's how the 3x3 grid is extracted:

- From row 2 to row 8, and column 2 to column 6.
- Then, trimming to get only the central 3x3 block with emphasis on the pattern of ""8""s.

447fd412,"Based on the provided examples, the transformation rule appears to involve connecting separated sections with similar colors by filling in spaces between them. The connected sections take on a combined form, often creating larger contiguous regions.

Analyzing the Test case input, there are two main groups of colors:
- Group 1: Comprising of color `1` located at the top.
- Group 2: Comprising of color `2` located at the bottom and to the right of the first group.

To solve the test case, I'll connect these groups by filling in the gaps with their respective colors, as per the pattern observed in the examples:

a699fb00,"To derive the transformation rule, let's observe the differences between the provided input and output grids in the training examples:

- In Example 1, the transformation appears to add a '2' next to every '1', but only if there is no other number adjacent to it. This is also seen in Examples 2 and 3.
- The rule seems to apply only horizontally, not vertically, as vertical sequences do not receive the '2' transformation.
- Furthermore, '2's are added only on the right side when '1's are encountered.

Given these observations, I will apply the transformation rule to the test case input grid.

Test Case Input:
```python
[
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Applying the transformation rule to the test case input grid, we get:
```python
[
[0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

0ca9ddb6,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the provided examples.

In every instance, there seems to be a pattern where certain colors appear or reappear in specific configurations relative to the original non-zero entries. Specifically:

- The number 4 appears in configurations that seem to mirror or extend around the numbers 1 and 2.
- The number 7 also appears similarly around numbers 1 and 6, suggesting it might be associated with another color transformation.
- The number 8 is left as is, without any transformation affecting its position.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation involves placing the numbers 4 and 7 around other specific numbers in the grid according to some defined rule.

Let's apply this understanding to the test case:

Test Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Based on the rules inferred from the training examples, we should place numbers around the 1, 2, 8, and 6 according to their respective patterns. 

Here's the transformed output:

``` 
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 7, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],

[4, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

This matches the pattern observed in the previous examples, ensuring consistency with the transformation rule identified.

7447852a,"Based on the provided training examples, it appears that the transformation rule involves changing certain '0' values to '4' in a specific pattern. The pattern seems to involve the '0's located between '2's in the same row, but not immediately adjacent to a '2', especially in the middle portions of the rows.

To summarize the transformation rules for the given examples:

- '0's that are surrounded by '2's on either side (not necessarily directly adjacent) within a single row are often replaced by '4's.
- This replacement typically occurs in the central portion of the grid.

Applying these observations to the 'Test' case:

The transformed grid would look like this:

- Replace the '0's in the middle section of the first row with '4's.
- Replace the '0's between '2's in the second row with '4's.
- Replace the '0's in the middle section of the third row with '4's.

The outermost layer of the grid is filled with 3s, while the inner area has a pattern of 3s and 0s that looks like a fractal or recursive design, where the inner sections follow the same pattern as their outer sections but at a smaller scale.

To solve for the test case, we can extrapolate the pattern to a larger size. Each row and column in the pattern alternates between having a full row/column of 3s and a row/column mostly of 0s except for the outermost positions being 3s. As the grid size increases, the inner sections also develop similar patterns.

3906de3d,"Based on the examples provided, the transformation rule seems to involve filling in the zeros that are surrounded by ones (1s) and twos (2s), with the color of the surrounding numbers. Specifically, it appears that zeros surrounded by twos are turned into twos, while zeros surrounded by ones remain zeros unless they are directly adjacent to twos.

Let's apply this logic to the test case:

```python
[
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],

- The '4' block should move up and align without overlapping the '2' block.
- The '1' block should move up and align without overlapping the '4' block.

In all examples, there appears to be a specific pattern involving the number 8 and its effect on placing the number 3 in certain positions of the grid:

1. When an 8 is present, the number 3 appears in positions that seem to be diagonally adjacent or at increasing diagonal distances from the 8.
2. The placement of the 3s seems to follow a pattern where the 3s spread out in both up-left and down-right directions from the 8, avoiding overlapping with other 8s and stopping before reaching the edge of the grid or another 8.

1. In Example 1, we can see that numbers are moved up to fill empty slots without any number being overwritten if there's already a non-zero value in the destination slot.

2. Similarly, in Example 2, all the non-zero numbers move up as far as they can, but if there's another number in the way, they stop at that position. This means that the numbers are not displaced upwards if they would overwrite a non-zero value.

3. In Example 3, the same pattern is seen where the numbers move up towards the top of the grid while respecting the positions of existing non-zero values.

Following these observations for the test case, the transformation would involve moving all non-zero values as high up as possible within the grid, without overwriting other non-zero values.

f15e1fac,"Based on the provided training examples, the transformation rule seems to propagate color 8 in specific patterns. When there's a single 8 or 2 in a row or column, it spreads the 8's in a wave-like pattern starting from the position of the original 8. The spread does not seem to cross over cells with 2.

After analyzing the patterns, for the given test case, the transformation can be described as follows:

- The cell with value 8 at position (2, 16) should spread 8s leftward.
- The cell with value 8 at position (5, 16) should spread 8s leftward.
- The cell with value 8 at position (8, 16) should spread 8s leftward.
- The cell with value 8 at position (9, 16) should spread 8s leftward.
- The cell with value 8 at position (10, 16) should spread 8s leftward.

However, there is a '2' in the test case at positions (11, 2), (11, 7), and (11, 11). These should block the propagation of '8' from spreading beyond their locations, meaning no '8' should appear to the right of these '2' cells in the same row.

Applying this transformation rule to the test case, here is the expected output grid:

fafffa47,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the inputs to produce the outputs, let's analyze the patterns:

1. The output matrices are smaller than the inputs.
2. The output seems to focus on a specific pattern of numbers in the input.
3. The transformation appears to convert certain patterns in the input into specific values in the output.

Looking at how zeros (0s) and nines (9s) are transformed into twos (2s) and zeros (0s) in the outputs, we can hypothesize that the transformation focuses on the relationship between zeros and nines in adjacent cells within the input grid.

Based on the given examples, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- If an input cell has a zero (0) surrounded by nines (9) or vice versa, then the corresponding cell in the output is set to two (2).
- All other cells become zero (0).

Applying this rule to the test case:

Test Case: Input
```[
[9, 0, 9],
[0, 0, 9],
[9, 0, 9],
[0, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 0],
[1, 0, 0]]
```

We see a 3x3 pattern formed by zeros (0) and nines (9):

```[
[9, 0, 9],
[0, 0, 9],
[9, 0, 9]
]```

Applying the rule, zeros surrounded by nines (or vice versa) turn into twos (2), resulting in:

```[
[0, 2, 0],
[2, 2, 0],
[0, 2, 0]
]```

The lower part of the test case involving ones (1) does not affect the 3x3 result since our pattern only involves zeros (0) and nines (9).

So the final output for the test case should be:

Answer: ```[[0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0]]```","[[0 2 0]

a65b410d,"To derive the transformation rule from the provided examples, we observe that the rule involves adding a certain number of layers of ""3""s around the first row with non-zero elements (which is row containing '2's) and then decrementing the layer color down to '1'. Each layer extends one cell less than the previous one until reaching the row with non-zero elements.

Let’s analyze the test case:
- We need to create three layers of '3's, two layers of '2's, and one layer of '1', all extending from the row containing '2's.
- The '2' row is the third row, so we start adding layers above it.

Following this pattern, the solution would look like:

5117e062,"To derive the transformation rule from the input examples to the output examples, we need to observe how the original larger grids transform into smaller 3x3 grids. Let's go through the observations:

- The output grids are always 3x3.
- There seems to be a focus on selecting central or prominent shapes from the input grids.

By analyzing the provided training examples, one can identify that the transformation appears to extract central, contiguous regions (with respect to non-zero values) from the larger grids, scaling them down to fit into a 3x3 grid.

Given this pattern in the training data, for the test case, we should look at the largest non-zero cluster in the center and convert it to a 3x3 grid.

For the test case:
```python

The most prominent region in this case is the region with value `7` and `8`. Extracting this region into a 3x3 grid would be:
```python

So, the solution for the test case is:

ba26e723,"The pattern in the transformation rule seems to be that every other ""4"" in the sequence changes to a ""6"", starting with the second row and alternating the starting position between rows.

Following the pattern observed, we apply the transformation:

- In the first row, no change occurs.
- In the second row, every other ""4"" is replaced with ""6"" starting from the beginning.
- In the third row, every other ""4"" is replaced with ""6"" starting from the second column.

Applying these rules to the test case:

25d8a9c8,"To derive the transformation rule applied in the provided examples, we analyze how the input grids are transformed into their respective output grids.

Observations:
- When an entire row or column has the same color number, the output replaces that row/column with a new color value.
- The new color value seems to be determined by the original color value of the row or column. Specifically, there appears to be a pattern where particular numbers transform to ""0"" except for ""4"" which transforms to ""5"".

Based on these observations, let's apply the rule(s) to our test case:

Test Input:
[
[4, 4, 4],   // Entire row has the same color, should map to a new value
[3, 2, 3],   // Mixed colors within the row, no transformation required
[8, 8, 8]    // Entire row has the same color, should map to a new value
]

Transforming the rows based on the derived rule:
- The first row (all 4s) should transform to all 5s.
- The third row (all 8s) should transform to all 0s.
- The second row, with mixed colors, remains unchanged.

50cb2852,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given input/output examples:

1. The grid contains several blocks of different shapes with distinct numbers.
2. In the output, some numbers within these blocks change to a new number (in particular, the number `8`).
3. Based on the patterns in the output, the number `8` appears to replace certain numbers inside blocks that have at least one neighbor with an identical number.

In the training examples:
- The blocks consisting of `2`s and `1`s get an inner pattern filled with `8`s.
- Similarly, the block consisting of `3`s also got its inner area transformed to `8`.

From these observations, we can formulate the following rule:
- For each block of the same number (excluding the border), if there is a cell that has at least two neighbors with the same value, that cell will be changed to `8`.

c3e719e8,"To solve the test case, let's analyze the transformation rule from the examples provided:

In each example, the original 3x3 grid is transformed into a 9x9 grid where the original grid appears in three different configurations:
1. In the top-left corner.
2. In the center position.
3. In the bottom-right corner.

Additionally, all other cells outside these positions are filled with zeros.

Given the pattern observed, we can apply the same transformation to the test input grid:

623ea044,"To solve the test case, we need to determine the pattern or rule based on the training examples provided.

In the first example, a single '2' is placed at position (3,3). In the output, there is a diagonal pattern of '2's starting from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the grid, with every third position on the main diagonal and its mirror across the center filled with '2'.

In the second example, a single '7' is placed at position (5,11). The output shows a diagonal pattern of '7's that starts from the top left corner to the bottom right corner and wraps around to fill in positions diagonally across the grid. The pattern also reflects across the horizontal axis.

In the third example, a single '8' is placed at position (3,2). The output again follows a diagonal pattern similar to the first two examples but with fewer rows and columns.

From the analysis above, we can conclude that the pattern involves placing the color value on the main diagonal and mirrored positions across the center of the grid.

Therefore, for the test case where a '6' is placed at position (7,12), the output will follow the same diagonal pattern.

Let's construct the solution grid:

```python
output = [[0]*17 for _ in range(17)]
position = 7
color = 6

for i in range(17):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        output[i][i+5] = color
        output[i][16-i-5] = color
    else:
        output[i][i+4] = color
        output[i][16-i-4] = color

# Adjusting the exact position of '6' at (7,12) and mirrored positions
output[7][12] = color
output[7][4] = color
output[12][7] = color
output[4][7] = color

a5f85a15,"To solve the test case, let's first figure out the transformation rule based on the provided training examples:

1. In Example 1, the middle number in the diagonal was doubled from 2 to 4.
2. In Example 2, numbers that were not on the edge were changed to 4 if they were not already a 9.
3. In Example 3, similar to Example 2, non-edge positions with values other than 3 were changed to 4.

From these observations, we can conclude the transformation rule seems to be:
- For any number that is not on the edge of the grid and is not already the value 9, change it to 4.

Let's apply this rule to the test case grid:

9af7a82c,"To derive the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's analyze the patterns:

1. **Reordering:** In each output example, the numbers seem to be reordered, often with the largest or most frequent number appearing first in the sequence.
2. **Padding with Zeros:** Each output example has been expanded vertically, and the new rows contain mostly zeros with a few non-zero elements that follow a specific pattern.

### Observations:
- The first column in the output contains the most frequent element in the input, which is repeated in every row.
- The second column contains the second most frequent element, followed by zeros as padding.
- Subsequent columns continue to follow this pattern, filling with zeros as needed to create a grid larger than the original.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
The given test case input is:
```
[
[8, 8, 2, 2],
[1, 8, 8, 2],
[1, 3, 3, 4],
[1, 1, 1, 1]]
```

Let's identify the most common elements:
- The most frequent number is `1` (appears 7 times).
- Next is `8` (appears 5 times).
- Then `2` (appears 3 times).
- Finally `3` and `4` (appear 2 and 1 times respectively).

Transforming the grid according to the identified rule:
- The first column should be filled with `1`.
- The second column should be filled with `8`, then zero-padded.
- The third column should be filled with `2`, then zero-padded.
- The fourth column should be filled with `3`, then zero-padded.
- The fifth column should be filled with `4`, then zero-padded.

Based on this logic, the transformed output will be:

ec883f72,"To solve this puzzle, we need to observe the pattern from the training examples. In each of the provided examples, the transformation seems to involve placing smaller non-zero elements in the upper-left corner of the grid based on the non-zero elements already present.

- In Example 1, there's a `3` at positions `(0,0)` and `(1,0)`, and another `3` added at position `(4,4)` and `(5,5)`.
- In Example 2, numbers `6` and `8` are present in the middle and upper part of the grid; additional `6`s are placed in positions `(3,1)`, `(4,0)`, and `(3,7)`.
- In Example 3, `2` appears in the lower half, and new `2`s are placed in the upper left.
- In Example 4, `4` appears in the upper right and lower parts, and new `4`s are placed in the upper left quadrant but in scattered positions.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that the transformation involves taking the smallest non-zero number present in the original grid and placing it in the upper left of the grid in certain sparse positions.

For the test case:
- We have `3` and `4` as the non-zero numbers.
- The smallest non-zero number is `3`.

6c434453,"To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes from the input to the output in both provided examples.

First, note that in the output grids, some cells containing `1` have been replaced with `2`. It appears that cells with `1` are being converted to `2` if they are part of isolated groups (i.e., not directly connected to another `1`, either horizontally or vertically).

### Analysis of Transformation Rule:

- **Isolated Groups**: A group is considered isolated if all `1`s within it do not share an edge with any other `1`s outside their group.
  
- **Replacement Rule**: Every `1` in an isolated group is changed to `2`.

Let's apply this to the test case.

#### Step-by-step Application on Test Case:

1. Identify isolated groups of `1`s.
2. Replace these groups' `1`s with `2`s.

For the given test case:

```python
test_input = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
]
```

Upon inspection, we can see that the `1`s in the following positions form isolated groups:
- Positions (3, 1), (4, 1), and (5, 1)
- Positions (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1)

We can replace these with `2`s.

```python
test_output = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
]
```

Thus, the solution for the test case is:

```py

d22278a0,"Based on the provided training examples, it seems the transformation rule involves creating patterns with the non-zero numbers (colors) present in the input grid. Specifically, the rule appears to alternate these numbers in a checkerboard-like pattern across the grid while keeping the zeros where they are.

In the test input, there's a `4` at the top-left corner, and an `8` at the bottom-left corner, followed by a `1` at the bottom-right corner. Considering the rule, we can predict that the `4` will create a checkerboard pattern from the top-left, and similarly for `8` and `1`.

1f642eb9,"To determine the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's analyze the patterns between the inputs and outputs:

1. **Colors changing:** We notice that certain colors change in specific positions. For instance, in Example 1, the '8' at position (3, 4) changes to '9' when the number '9' at position (0, 4) is present. This suggests a possible interaction where if a unique color appears above or below in a column and another color is adjacent to it horizontally, the adjacent color might change.

2. **Unique colors influencing adjacent ones:** In all examples, we see unique colors (like '9', '7', etc.) affecting the immediate adjacent colors within a column. The exact nature of change follows a pattern where the unique color seems to ""spread"" to adjacent colors under certain conditions.

Applying the observed pattern to the test case:

- For the unique color '6' at position (0,3), we don't see any immediate horizontal adjacency with another color in the same column.
- For the unique color '2' at position (0,5), we observe an impact on the color '8' in position (3,5) and other positions in its column.
- The color '9' at position (3,0) doesn't influence anything as there's no other unique color in its column.
- The color '7' at position (4,9) only influences the color '8' at position (3,9).
- The color '6' at position (9,4) affects the color '8' above it.

Observations from the examples:
- Each original grid is 9x9.
- The output grid is always a 3x3 grid.
- The pattern in the output grid seems to consist of elements taken from specific positions or patterns within the input grid.
- The pattern appears to be formed by taking the most common elements from the middle column and row of the input grid.

Given that, let's look at how the transformations seem to occur:
- Take the elements from the middle three rows and columns of the input grid.
- Form a new 3x3 grid by selecting the most frequent color present in the intersection of those rows and columns.

Using this hypothesis on the Test Case:

Focusing on the central 3x3 region:
```plaintext
[

From this 3x3 region, we can construct our output grid by taking the most frequent number in each position:
- First row: [8, 1, 8]
- Second row: [8, 8, 1]
- Third row: [1, 8, 8]

Based on these observations and the pattern, the output should be:

a68b268e,"To derive the transformation rule from the provided training examples, one key observation is that the output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. Each output grid is a 4x4 matrix. It appears that certain colors from the borders or corners of the input grids are being selected to form the output grids.

Upon closer inspection, the pattern seems to involve taking specific elements from the boundaries of the input grid (corners and edges) to form the output. Given the consistent placement of colors in the output, we can deduce that:

1. The first column of the output grid is formed by the first column of the input grid.
2. The second column of the output grid comes from the last column of the input grid.
3. The third column of the output grid is derived from the first row of the input grid.
4. The fourth column of the output grid corresponds to the last row of the input grid.

Observing the transformations from the training examples:

1. The outermost layer's color is replaced with the next color in the sequence wrapping around if necessary. For instance, `8` becomes `4` which becomes `2`, and so on.
2. Each color inside the grid moves one step down and to the right, while colors that reach the boundary wrap around to the opposite side.

Based on these rules, let's apply them step-by-step to the provided test case:

First, we replace the outermost layer’s color `8` with `4`.

Then, each interior color moves one step down and right, wrapping around if necessary.

Following these steps, the transformed grid would look like this:

d06dbe63,"Analyzing the given examples, the transformation rule seems to introduce a pattern of '5's surrounding an existing '8' in the input grid. Specifically:

- A '5' will appear in a cross-shaped pattern around the '8', including horizontally and vertically adjacent cells.
- Additionally, there are extra '5's that form a larger surrounding area, creating a cross with ""arms"" of length two.

Applying this transformation rule to the test case with an '8' located at row 5, column 6 (zero-indexed), I will place '5's accordingly as per the observed pattern.

1. In Example 1, numbers 7 move diagonally up-right and down-left, while the number 5 remains in its column.
2. In Example 2, numbers 9 and 5 also shift along diagonal patterns.
3. In Example 3, numbers 2 appear to move diagonally up-right and down-left, and numbers 5 stay in their columns.

ed36ccf7,"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the transformations that happen in the training examples:

1. In Example 1, zeros that are next to nines get transformed into nines, and nines at the edge become zeros.
   
2. In Example 2, zeros that are surrounded by sixes get replaced by sixes, while a nine in the corner gets moved up one row.

3. In Example 3, there seems to be a reflection of the top row to the bottom, and the zeros in the middle column are unchanged.

4. In Example 4, zeros adjacent to twos get filled with twos, and the pattern of twos and zeros changes to balance around the center.

The transformation appears to be a combination of reflecting parts of the grid vertically and replacing isolated zeros with surrounding numbers. Considering these transformations, the test case should follow a similar logic.

In the test case, we have:
```
[
[0, 0, 0],
[5, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 5]]

- The first row of all zeros might reflect down to the bottom.
- The zeros in the second row could be replaced by fives when they're adjacent.

For the given test case, we need to locate the significant contiguous blocks and extract their shape as the output.

In the test input, there are two main blocks of interest: one with the color `9` and another with the color `3`. The block with color `3` is more centrally located and forms a larger connected region. Thus, based on the previous examples, the output should reflect the shape and structure of the `3` block.

The `3` block is structured as follows:
- It extends over four columns.
- It spans across two rows.

Therefore, the output grid would represent this structure.

b230c067,"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the transformation rule involves changing the value `8` in the input grid to `1` or `2` in the output grid. The pattern seems to be that groups of connected `8`s (where ""connected"" means touching horizontally or vertically) get assigned the same new value, either `1` or `2`. This process is known as component labeling or connected component labeling.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

```python

Analyzing the Training Examples:
1. In Example 1: The central region with color 5s in columns 6-8 rows 4-6 appears to be mirrored such that colors in columns 7-9 rows 4-6 move to columns 5-7 rows 4-6.
2. In Example 2: The process is similar where colored regions on the right side (like 5s) get transformed into different patterns involving 6 and 8, suggesting a complex mapping or transformation logic.

For the Test Case:
The pattern involves 4s and 1s at the top left and 5s at the bottom right. The transformation should mirror or reposition these blocks. Based on the previous examples, we may infer that the blocks of 5s will be mirrored, and similarly, the block of 1s and 4s might also need to undergo a similar transformation.

Proposed transformation:
- The middle section of 5s is mirrored into the upper part of the grid.
- The section with 4s and 1s is moved downwards or mirrored.

60b61512,"To solve the given test case, we need to identify the pattern or transformation rule which was applied in the training examples. By comparing the input and output grids of these examples, we can see that:

- Any cell with a value of `4` that has an adjacent (horizontally or vertically) empty cell (`0`) gets replaced with a value of `7`.
- This transformation applies only to cells directly adjacent to an empty cell; otherwise, the cell values remain unchanged.

Given the rule, let's apply it to the test case:

Test Case: Input
```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]]
```

Applying our identified rule:
- The `4` at `[1][4]` is surrounded by `0`s on both sides and thus turns into `7`.
- The `4` at `[2][2]`, `[2][3]`, and `[4][6]` are adjacent to `0`s, turning them into `7`.
- The `4` at `[3][2]` becomes `7` due to the `0` above.
- The `4` at `[8][6]` becomes `7` due to the `0` below.
- The sequence of `4`s at `[7][5]`, `[7][6]`, and `[7][7]` will transform differently. Only the `4`s that touch `0`s (on the edges) change to `7`.

So our transformed grid should look like this:

```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],

This essentially duplicates the content around the original center, creating a symmetrical pattern. For any given cell at position (i, j) in the input, the corresponding mirrored cells in the output are:

- horizontally mirrored at (i, 2*width - 1 - j)
- vertically mirrored at (2*height - 1 - i, j)

The combination of these two reflections results in a mirrored image that repeats the pattern.

Applying this rule to the test case:

e8dc4411,"Based on the given examples, the transformation rules seem to involve filling in certain areas with specific patterns after identifying zeros or other distinctive elements within the input grids. The pattern involves spreading a color (like 2s and 3s) from the zeros outwards, but not directly replacing zeros. Instead, they seem to fill the neighboring cells and then continue spreading according to a specific sequence.

For the test case, we can apply a similar logic. We will start from the zeros, identify their neighbors, and follow the spreading pattern observed in previous examples.

I noticed that there's no indication of what color should ""spread"" from the zeros, unlike in prior examples. Therefore, the pattern in this case does not change the zero-filled cells or their surroundings, resulting in no visible transformation.

Consequently, the transformed output remains the same as the input for this test case.

3428a4f5,"To solve the test case, we need to first understand the pattern or rule being applied in the transformation from input to the output grids.

Let's observe the general pattern from the training examples:

1. The transformation seems to map the color `2` to `3`, while `0` remains `0`.
2. However, the transformation also appears to flip the top half of the grid over the middle row after replacing `2` with `3`.

Given these observations, here is how we can approach the transformation for the test case:

1. Replace every `2` in the grid with `3`.
2. Split the grid into the top half and bottom half.
3. Flip the top half vertically.

Applying these steps to the test case:

Original Test Case:

[0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
[0, 0, 0, 2, 2],
[2, 0, 0, 0, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 0, 2],
[0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
[2, 0, 2, 2, 0],
[2, 0, 2, 2, 2]
]
```

Step 1: Replace `2` with `3`:
```python
[
[3, 0, 3, 3, 0],
[3, 0, 0, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 0, 0],
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
[0, 3, 3, 0, 0],

[0, 3, 3, 0, 0],
[3, 0, 3, 3, 0],
[3, 0, 3, 3, 3]
]
```

Step 2 and Step 3: Take the top half and flip it vertically:
- Top half before flipping:
```python
[
[3, 0, 3, 3, 0],
[3, 0, 0, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 0, 0],
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
[0, 3, 3, 0, 0],
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

```
- After flipping vertically:
```python
[
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
[0, 3, 3, 0, 0],
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 0, 0],

By closely investigating the transformations shown in the examples:

1. There seems to be a pattern where certain areas enclosed or semi-enclosed by '2's are filled with '9's.
2. Specifically, cells which are inside the borders formed by '2's but not adjacent to any '2' cells are turned into '9's.

Given the above observations, I can now apply this rule to the test case grid.

99b1bc43,"From the provided training examples, we can infer that the transformation rule involves changing certain patterns in the input grid to produce the output grid. Observing carefully, we notice that:

1. The middle row of numbers in the input grid (all 4s) does not appear in the output, so it seems to act as a separator or a trigger for the transformation.
2. Numbers above the middle row (containing all 4s) seem to influence the transformation of the numbers below them.
3. The output grid only contains 0s and 3s, suggesting that the original numbers are being mapped to these two values.

Analyzing pattern changes:
- When there are consecutive non-zero numbers in the upper part of the input grid, they tend to convert into the pattern of 3s in the output grid below.
- Isolated zeros tend to remain as zeros in the output grid.
- The pattern conversion is not direct but depends on the arrangement of 1s and 0s in the input grid and possibly involves some reflection or flipping based on the observed outputs.

To solve the test case, we need to apply the observed transformation rule:

``` 
Input Test Case:
[
[1, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 1, 1],
[0, 0, 1, 0],
[1, 0, 1, 1],
[4, 4, 4, 4],    # Middle row, ignored in transformation
[2, 2, 0, 2],
[0, 0, 2, 0],
[2, 0, 0, 2],
[0, 2, 0, 2]]
```

Given the patterns in the previous examples, let's apply the inferred transformation:

- The sequence of 1s and 0s above the middle row will dictate the pattern of 3s and 0s in the output.
- Patterns with dense 1s become dense 3s, and isolated 0s remain as 0s.

Thus, the transformed output should be:

``` 
Output Test Case:
[
[3, 0, 0, 3],
[0, 0, 3, 3],
[0, 0, 3, 0],
[3, 0, 0, 3]]
```

Answer: ```[[3, 0, 0, 3],[0, 0, 3, 3],[0, 0, 3, 0],[3, 0, 0, 3]]```","[[3 0 0 3]

bc1d5164,"Based on the provided examples, the transformation rule appears to be reducing the size of the input grid while preserving the pattern of non-zero elements in the central column and rows. Specifically, for each grid provided, the output seems to retain the central column and the corresponding elements from the top and bottom halves of the grid.

For the test case:
``` 
[ [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] ]
```

Following the observed pattern:

- The central column is the 6th column.
- We need to reduce the grid to a smaller one while keeping the central column pattern and matching top and bottom elements.

Reduced output would be:
``` 
[ [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1] ]
```

However, following the exact pattern seen in other examples where the central column (or close to central if even columns) is kept and only significant elements are transferred:
``` 
[ [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1] ]
```
matches the pattern as well but to be precise per the closest resemblance of the examples where central column and its mirrored elements are considered:
``` 
[ [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1] ]
```
is not fitting the minimal pattern.

Answer: ``` [[0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1]] ``` is too large; following strict patterns:
``` 
[ [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0] ]
```

Thus, the final answer should be:
Answer: ``` [[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]] ```","[[0 1 1]

d364b489,"To solve this puzzle, we need to observe the pattern in how the inputs transform into their respective outputs. Upon careful inspection, the transformation seems to involve:

1. **Rotation**: Each non-zero value in the input grid appears to rotate around a fixed point while maintaining its relative position to neighboring non-zero values.
2. **Color Change**: Non-zero values are incremented by specific amounts that seem to follow a pattern.

Given the provided examples, it looks like the transformation involves rotating the position of non-zero elements by some angle and then incrementing the colors in a consistent manner.

From the examples, we can deduce that:
- A non-zero value of `1` is transformed to `2`, `6`, or `7` based on its position and rotation.
- A non-zero value of `0` remains as `0`.

Using these observations, let's apply the transformation to the test case provided. We will rotate each non-zero value and adjust its color accordingly.

Test Case:

```python

    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],

    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

178fcbfb,"To solve this transformation puzzle, we need to observe the pattern in how the inputs are turned into outputs across the training examples.

In all examples, numbers that are not zero (colors) spread in a specific manner:

- Numbers spread over rows until they reach the top or bottom of the grid.
- When a number spreads, it also spreads across columns until it encounters another non-zero number, but only if that column is not already filled with another color.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to be spreading the first non-zero value found in the grid horizontally and vertically across the grid until it meets a boundary or another non-zero number.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- The first non-zero value encountered is `3` at position `[0][3]`.
- The second non-zero value is `2` at position `[1][9]`.
- There is another `3` at position `[3][5]`, and `2` again at position `[5][4]`.
- Finally, there are two `1`s at positions `[7][1]` and `[9][8]`.

Starting from the top-left of the grid, we apply the transformation:
- `3` would spread from `[0][3]` to `[10][3]` (top to bottom).
- `2` spreads from `[1][9]` to `[10][9]` (top to bottom).
- Another `3` and `2` would spread similarly, but they won't affect the grid because the columns are already occupied by `3` and `2` respectively.
- `1` will spread from `[7][1]` to `[10][1]`, and `[7][1]` to `[7][8]`, but since `[7][8]` to `[10][8]` is already filled with `2`, it stops at column 8.

So, applying this pattern to the test case:

```python

6855a6e4,"To solve the test case, let's analyze the transformation rules observed in the training examples provided:

- When there are adjacent non-zero elements that form a distinct shape (like an ""L"", a square or a line), they tend to rearrange while keeping their relative positions, and the entire arrangement may shift vertically or horizontally within the grid as long as they remain connected.
- For instance, a vertical line of 5s on the right side in Example 1 was moved up and became part of the middle section.
- In Example 2, the 5s that were originally positioned around the central 2s shifted down, while the 2s stayed in place.
- Similarly, in Example 3, the 5s that surrounded the central 2s shifted vertically while staying connected.

Based on these observations and patterns, let's apply the transformation to the test case provided:

The test case has:
1. A cluster of 5s on the top left corner.
2. A central horizontal line of 2s.
3. Another cluster of 5s on the bottom center.

Following the pattern of maintaining connections and adjusting positions within the grid, we can predict the following layout for our test case where the clusters of 5s move closer to the central line of 2s:

228f6490,"Based on the provided examples, the transformation rule seems to involve replacing certain regions of colors with other colors or leaving them unchanged. The process appears to involve recognizing large contiguous blocks of color and replacing their contents with other defined colors, essentially 'painting over' parts of the grid. 

To apply this rule to the test case, I need to identify such regions and then apply the transformation based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Analyzing the test input, we can see several large contiguous blocks of the same color, particularly blocks of `5` and `7`. Observing the patterns from previous transformations suggests that regions of `5` may get replaced with other numbers or remain unchanged, while regions of `7` could potentially be altered. However, the exact replacements aren't strictly uniform across all examples, so we have to carefully select which areas and how they should change according to the observed rules.

Applying these rules to the test case:

```python
[
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2],
[2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4],
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2],
[7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
[0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5],
[2, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
]
```
In this solution, I have replaced most occurrences of `5` with `8`, except for isolated `5`s which remained unchanged, and kept `7`s as they appeared in their own distinct block without clear replacement pattern from the training data. This transformation attempts to match the pattern seen in the training examples where larger blocks of a single color are often replaced in bulk.

22233c11,"To solve the given problem, we need to identify the pattern or transformation rule from the provided training examples. Observing the examples, it appears that any '3' value in the input triggers an '8' value to appear around it in the output, according to certain rules. 

The placement of '8' seems to follow these observations:
- '8's appear around clusters of '3's, but not directly adjacent to them.
- The placement of '8's is at the outer boundaries of where the '3's exist, forming a kind of border or outline.

For the test case, we have a larger cluster of '3's in several rows and columns. Applying the observed rule, the '8's will be placed to form an outline around these clusters while avoiding direct adjacency to the existing '3's.

Let's apply these observations:

```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 8],
[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 8],
[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 8],
[8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

```

This pattern forms the boundary around the central cluster of '3's while keeping the '8's one step away from the '3's. This solution aligns with the patterns seen in the training examples.

Therefore, the answer for the test case is:

41e4d17e,"To solve the test case, let's analyze the transformation rules based on the provided examples:

1. **Color Change Rule**: In the output grids, certain cells that were originally color `8` have been changed to color `6`. This seems to happen particularly around blocks of `1`s.

2. **Transformation Pattern**: Specifically, around the blocks of `1`s, there appears to be a ""halo"" or an extension of `6`s. It seems that wherever a `1` is surrounded by `8`s, the surrounding `8`s transform into `6` under certain conditions. This transformation is especially notable in vertical and horizontal lines where `1`s form a contiguous block.

Applying these insights to the test case, we aim to replace the relevant `8`s with `6`s.

48d8fb45,"To solve the transformation rule, we need to identify what changes are being made from the input to the output. Observing the provided examples:

- Each output grid is a 3x3 matrix.
- It appears that the transformation involves reducing larger input grids into smaller 3x3 grids by selecting certain elements based on their positions or patterns.

From the examples provided, we can discern the following pattern: only non-zero values seem to be retained in the 3x3 grid, and their positions are somehow mapped from the larger grid down to the smaller one.

For instance, in Example 1, non-zero elements are mostly concentrated in the bottom right corner of the large grid, and they map onto a 3x3 structure with some non-zero elements remaining. Similarly, for Example 2 and 3, the non-zero elements are chosen and placed in the 3x3 grid based on their relative positions in the original grid.

Given this insight, let's apply the same to our test case:

```python
# Test Case Input

# Applying the pattern observed, mapping non-zero values to the 3x3 grid:
# Bottom-right concentration of non-zero values suggests this part should dominate.
# Positions map to the 3x3 grid roughly based on their relative location within the original grid.
```

The non-zero elements are found mainly in the lower sections of the larger grid. They should be mapped to the 3x3 grid maintaining their relative positions.

760b3cac,"The transformation rules involve the number 8 specifically. For each row in the input grid, if there is at least one '8', then the pattern of '8's is mirrored or expanded such that it reaches outwards from its original position up to but not beyond any existing '8'. This means if there is an '8' in a cell, adjacent cells that are '0' might become '8' depending on the presence of other '8's in that row.

For the given test case:

- The first row has two '8's, so we mirror their positions.
- The second row has a pair of '8's, which should expand the pattern symmetrically.
- The third row has a single '8', which should also be mirrored in its row.
- Rows with '4' and no change needed remain the same.

36d67576,"To deduce the transformation rule from the provided examples, we need to observe how the elements in the input grids map to their corresponding positions in the output grids.

Observations from the examples:
- Elements appear to move or shift their positions in a somewhat systematic manner; however, they do not simply translate up, down, left, or right uniformly.
- Some patterns emerge where certain numbers seem to ""push"" others to new positions, especially in areas with dense number groups.
- Numbers don't just shift within the boundaries of the same color blocks but also seem to affect adjacent blocks.

Given these observations, the transformation seems to involve some form of shifting based on adjacency and pattern recognition. For instance, in Example 3, the '4' block towards the bottom-right pushes '1' and '3' into new positions, indicating that there might be a kind of ""collision"" rule when two numbers meet at an edge.

- Within such identified blocks, except for the border cells (surrounding the block), replace the internal cells with a new color (in this case, color 2).

The position of '1' in the last row is determined by its location in the corresponding input grid. From the provided examples, I can see that the value '1' shifts diagonally upward and to the left as the width of the grid increases.

For a 5-column wide grid (like the test case), we should arrange the numbers 8 and 1 such that the position of '1' in the last row corresponds to the position where '1' appears in the input's last row; the rest of the columns will cycle through 8 and 1 from right to left.

a61ba2ce,"To solve the test case, we need to apply the observed transformation rule from the training examples. By analyzing the provided examples, it appears that the pattern involves taking the colored elements (non-zero values) and rearranging them into a smaller grid while preserving their relative positions.

For Example 1, the colored elements are:
- `8`s at positions (1,6), (1,7)
- `2`s at positions (3,1), (3,2), (4,2)
- `1`s at positions (7,8), (8,8), (8,9)
- `3`s at positions (9,3), (9,4)

These elements are then arranged in a new grid as follows:
``` 
[8, 8, 2, 2]

ac0a08a4,"To solve the test case, let's identify the pattern in the transformation rule used in the training examples.

The transformation rule appears to expand the input grid into a larger output grid by replicating each non-zero cell in all directions until it reaches the edge of the grid. Specifically:

- The grid size is expanded to be the sum of the original grid dimensions, i.e., if the original grid is n x m, the new grid will be n*m x n*m.
- Every non-zero value in the input grid is replicated in a square block in its corresponding position in the output grid such that the value fills a square block whose side length equals the original number of columns (m).
- All other cells not part of these replicated blocks are filled with zeros.

Using this understanding, let's apply it to the test case:

Test Input:
``` 
[
[1, 0, 0],
[0, 9, 6],
[8, 0, 0]]
```

The input has 3 rows and 3 columns, so the output grid will be 3*3 = 9 rows by 3*3 = 9 columns.

Let's replicate the non-zero values accordingly:
- The '1' at (0, 0) will fill the top-left 3x3 block.
- The '9' at (1, 1) will fill a central 3x3 block.
- The '6' at (1, 2) will fill a 3x3 block to the right of the center.
- The '8' at (2, 0) will fill the bottom-left 3x3 block.

So, the output grid for the test case should look like this:

1. We see that when there is one or more cells with value `1`, they are surrounded by cells containing value `3`. This 'surrounding' seems to extend horizontally along the row if there are multiple `1`s in the same row.
2. However, the `3`s do not appear to extend beyond the immediate neighborhood of the `1` cells and only form a small cluster.

Given these observations, let's apply the rule to the test case.

d687bc17,"To deduce the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's observe the changes from input to output in the provided examples. We notice that:

- Numbers within the inner boundaries (non-border) change according to some pattern.
- Specific numbers (like 7 or 8) seem to influence neighboring cells, possibly spreading their effect.
- There are several instances where a number spreads across the grid, often filling gaps or replacing certain other numbers.

Given these observations, here's a hypothesis for the transformation rule:

1. Identify any specific numbers like 7 or 8 which act as ""spreaders"".
2. These spreader numbers propagate to adjacent empty (0) cells and can override other numbers based on adjacency and the presence of another spreader number.
3. Borders and edge numbers around the spreaders remain intact, indicating that the spread operation does not extend beyond the borders.

This output follows the observed pattern where numbers like 7 and 8 cause changes in the grid, filling gaps and sometimes overriding numbers. Since the pattern isn't straightforward and might involve multiple iterations of spreading and overriding, the above solution assumes a simplified interpretation based on the examples provided.

b94a9452,"To determine the transformation rule from the provided examples, we see that:

1. The grid is first reduced to only the area where non-zero values exist.
2. The smallest rectangle that includes all non-zero values is selected.
3. Within this rectangle, a unique pattern emerges where the outermost color surrounding the inner shapes is replaced with the color of the next inner shape.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule applied in each example involves cropping the grid to focus on the non-zero elements and then replacing the outermost non-zero border with the next most nested non-zero value.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

The test case has a rectangle of 3s with an inner rectangle of 8s. We crop the grid to this rectangle and replace the outer 3s with the inner color 8.

6430c8c4,"To find the pattern or the transformation rule applied to the inputs to create the outputs, let's observe that each output is significantly smaller than its corresponding input, suggesting some form of reduction or summarization.

In each example, the transformation seems to focus on the presence or absence of a particular color in each quadrant of the input grid. Specifically, the transformation appears to map the color `7` into `3`, and the output grid represents the presence (`3`) or absence (`0`) of `7` in each quadrant of the input grid.

Let's break down how this works for each training example:

1. **Example 1:** 
   - Quadrants 1, 2, 3, and 4 are evaluated for color `7`. Only Quadrant 1 has `7`s present.
   - Result: `[0, 0, 3, 0]`

2. **Example 2:**
   - Quadrants 1, 2, 3, and 4 are evaluated for color `7`.
   - Quadrant 1 has `7`s in the upper left corner. Quadrants 2 and 3 have `7`s, and Quadrant 4 has `7`s.
   - Result: `[0, 3, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 3]`

3. **Example 3:**
   - Quadrants 1, 2, 3, and 4 are evaluated for color `7`.
   - Quadrants 1 and 2 have `7`s. Quadrants 3 and 4 have `7`s.
   - Result: `[3, 3, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3], [3, 0, 0, 0]`

4. **Example 4:**
   - Quadrants 1, 2, 3, and 4 are evaluated for color `7`.
   - Quadrant 1, 2, and 4 have `7`s. Quadrant 3 does not.
   - Result: `[0, 3, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0]`

Using this understanding, we can now apply the same transformation to the provided test case:

- The test case has:
  - Quadrant 1: Full of `7`
  - Quadrant 2: Partly `7`
  - Quadrant 3: No `7`
  - Quadrant 4: Partially `7`

Thus, the output for the test case would be:
``` Answer: [[3, 3, 0, 0]] ```

This implies that the transformation rule is considering only the first row of quadrants (upper half) and marking with `3` where any `7` exists in a quadrant, otherwise `0`.

Therefore, the final answer is:
```

46442a0e,"After analyzing the transformation applied in the training examples, we can see that the output grid is essentially a mirrored version of the input, both horizontally and vertically. This means each row is duplicated below itself, and each column is duplicated beside itself.

To apply this rule to the test case:

444801d8,"To transform the input into the output, the following rule seems to apply:

For each distinct color (number) in the input grid, if that color is surrounded by zeros and not connected (adjacently or diagonally) to any other non-zero color, replace all instances of that color with the next higher color (if the current color is `n`, then it becomes `n+1`). If the highest color is `9`, it stays as `9`. This transformation only happens for isolated colored regions.

Applying this rule to the given test case, we find three isolated regions of colors - a central '1', a '4' and an '8' (which would become '5', '4+1=5', and '7' respectively).

Therefore, the answer is:

- In all cases, the original non-zero numbers (like 8, 1, 2, and here 4) in the inputs remain in their positions in the outputs.
- The transformation seems to fill the remaining cells with two alternating numbers: 5 and the number that was originally present in the input.
- There's a checkerboard or alternating pattern being applied to the zeros in the input, where non-zero numbers are preserved, and zeros are replaced with either 5 or the non-zero number based on an alternating pattern.

2. It appears `3` is inserted into regions where there aren't any other specific patterns or color groups.

In summary, it seems the transformation rule fills with `3`s the area just below and around existing color patches that do not already have a defined pattern (i.e., where `3`s haven't been placed before).

However, reviewing the previous logic, it seems I have over-complicated the output. Considering the pattern of filling rows to the right or left of an '8' without considering the entire row length unnecessarily, the correct transformation should be simpler as follows:

```python
for row in input_grid:
    first_8_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(row) if x == 8), None)
    last_8_index = next((len(row)-i-1 for i, x in enumerate(reversed(row)) if x == 8), None)
    if first_8_index is not None and last_8_index is not None:
        row = [8 if first_8_index <= j <= last_8_index else 0 for j in range(len(row))]
    elif first_8_index is not None:
        row = [8 if first_8_index <= j else 0 for j in range(len(row))]
    elif last_8_index is not None:
        row = [8 if j <= last_8_index else 0 for j in range(len(row))]
    output_grid.append(row)

Observing patterns in the provided examples, the output seems to reflect whether there is a block of color '2' in specific quadrants of the input grid.

Each quadrant in the output corresponds to a specific larger quadrant in the input grid:
- Top-left quadrant: corresponds to the top-left quadrant of the input.
- Top-center quadrant: corresponds to the center-top part of the input grid.
- Top-right quadrant: corresponds to the top-right quadrant of the input.
- Middle-left quadrant: corresponds to the middle-left part of the input grid.
- Middle-center quadrant: corresponds to the middle-center part of the input grid.
- Middle-right quadrant: corresponds to the middle-right part of the input grid.
- Bottom-left quadrant: corresponds to the bottom-left quadrant of the input.
- Bottom-center quadrant: corresponds to the center-bottom part of the input grid.
- Bottom-right quadrant: corresponds to the bottom-right quadrant of the input.

The value '1' in the output indicates the presence of at least one '2' in the corresponding quadrant of the input, and '0' indicates no '2'.

Given these insights, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Input:

Analyzing quadrants:
- Top-left: Contains '2'.

- Top-right: Contains '2'.
- Middle-left: Contains '2'.
- Middle-center: Contains '2'.
- Middle-right: Contains '2'.

From the examples, the transformation rule seems to be rotating the non-zero elements (excluding the 3s which seem to remain in place) within each square region of the grid around their center in a counterclockwise direction. 

For the test case, I'll apply this rotation rule while keeping the 3s in their original positions:

f8ff0b80,"To solve this puzzle, let's review the transformation rules based on the training examples provided.

In each of the examples, the transformation rule appears to extract a single column of unique non-zero colors from the input grid. The order of these columns in the output seems to be determined by the color's first appearance from left to right, top to bottom, and then arranged in reverse order.

Let's analyze the test case input:

1. It has three distinct non-zero colors: 3, 1, and 6.
2. We see the color 3 in columns 2 and 3.
3. We see the color 1 in columns 5-7.
4. We see the color 6 in columns 8 and 7.

Based on our analysis, we would extract the right-most columns with these colors. For color 3, it will be the 3rd column since the 2nd column has fewer instances. For color 1, it will be the 7th column because it is the right-most column with 1's. And for color 6, it will be the 8th column because it is the right-most column with 6's.

Following the pattern of arranging them in reverse order of their appearance in the grid (from left to right), the order of columns in the output grid should be: [6], [1], [3].

- The patterns seem to involve numbers like `7`, `2`, `8`, `6`, `3`, `4`, etc., being repeated around certain positions in the grid.
- It looks like whenever there's a specific number at some position in the input grid (like `7` or `8`), the output grid shows that number surrounded by another number (like `2` surrounding `7` or `6` surrounding `8`) in a sort of symmetric pattern.
  
For the test case given, we have `3` and `4`. Based on the observed pattern, `3` seems to be surrounded by `4` in a similar fashion.

We can apply this pattern to the test case:

- First, identify occurrences of `3` and `4`.
- Then, surround `3`s with `4`s symmetrically.

Applying this to the test case:

From the examples, we can deduce that the value 0 transforms into either 2, 3, or 4 depending on its position relative to 5s. Here's how:

- When there are no 5s in the adjacent cells (immediate neighbors), 0 turns into 3.
- When there is a 5 directly above or below a 0, that 0 becomes a 4.
- When there is a 5 directly to the left or right of a 0, that 0 turns into a 2.

Using these rules, let's apply them to the test case:

Test Input:
```
[[0, 0, 5],
 [5, 0, 0],
 [0, 5, 0]]

Applying our transformation rules:
- The 0 in the top-left corner (1st row, 1st column) has a 5 directly to its right, so it becomes a 2.
- The 0 in the top-middle position (1st row, 2nd column) has a 5 directly to its right, so it becomes a 2.
- The 0 in the middle-left position (2nd row, 1st column) has a 5 directly above it, so it becomes a 4.
- The 0 in the bottom-left position (3rd row, 1st column) has a 5 immediately to its right, so it becomes a 2.
- The 0 in the middle-right position (2nd row, 3rd column) has a 5 directly above it, so it becomes a 4.
- The 0 in the bottom-middle position (3rd row, 2nd column) has a 5 directly above it, so it becomes a 4.

63613498,"By analyzing the training examples, we can see that the transformation applied to each input involves changing some specific color groups into another color, usually the dominant color in their vicinity.

In Example 1:
- The '6' group is being transformed into '5'.

In Example 2:
- The '9' group is being transformed into '5'.

In Example 3:
- The '1' group is being transformed into '5'.

This seems to imply that smaller isolated regions of one color that are surrounded or close to another larger region of a different color are changed to that color.

Applying this rule to the test case:

The '3' and '6' groups should be changed.
- The '3's are isolated and surrounded mostly by '5's and '6's, but because they are not directly adjacent to '5's and surrounded by '6's, we change them to '5'.
- The '6' group is isolated and surrounded by '2's and '5's, but since '5' is present at the base, we change most of the '6's to '5', except for the topmost '6' which remains as it has no direct 5 in its vicinity.

Therefore, the solution to the test case is:

b8cdaf2b,"To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the pattern or rule used in transforming the input grids into their corresponding output grids. Observing the transformations:

- In Example 1, the color 4 appears at the top corners surrounding an area that has a color inside.
- In Example 2, color 3 appears around the central square of zeros, with color 4 appearing at the next outer layer.
- In Example 3, the color 1 appears around the central square of zeros, with color 6 below.
- In Example 4, color 4 surrounds a central block of zeros in two layers.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation involves placing a new color (the second highest number present in the input grid) around the outermost non-zero area.

For the Test case, the highest numbers present are 8 and 2. The 8's define the outermost non-zero area. So, the second highest number, which is 2, should appear around this area.

Applying this rule:
- Place 2 around the outermost non-zero 8s and 2s.

The transformed grid would look like:

694f12f3,"Based on the training examples provided, the transformation rule appears to be the following:

- If a central area in a larger group of the same color has at least two sides bordered by the same color, then the inner block of that area is replaced with a new color.
- Two separate transformations can happen in one grid, each replacing the inner block with a different new color.

Applying these rules to the test input:
- The top-left block of 4s has an inner section that is not surrounded on all sides by 4s, so it remains unchanged.
- The bottom-right block of 4s has an inner section that is surrounded on all sides by 4s, so we replace its innermost part with a new color based on the pattern seen in the examples. Since we've seen both 1 and 2 being used as new colors in the examples, but not in the same grid, we'll choose one of them to fill the innermost 4s.

- `4` is replaced with `6`.
- `3` is also replaced with `6`.

d2abd087,"To derive the transformation rule, we need to observe how the values in the input grids change to become the output grids.

In all examples provided, the value `5` is transformed into either `1` or `2`. This suggests that `5` represents one or more areas in the grid which are re-labeled with distinct identifiers (`1` and `2`). The pattern of labeling appears to be maintaining the adjacency of elements with the same label. In other words, connected components of `5`s are changed to either `1` or `2`, but each separate cluster of `5`s gets its own unique identifier.

Let's apply this understanding to the test case:

- We identify clusters of `5`s.
- We replace each cluster of `5`s with `1` or `2` depending on its position or separation from others.

The test input is:
```plaintext

Examining the provided examples, we can see that the central non-zero elements remain unchanged in their positions. Around these central elements, there seems to be a mirroring effect where the values fill out the surrounding areas symmetrically in a specific pattern. 

Let's break down the mirroring rule more precisely:
- The numbers around the center block are mirrored along the horizontal and vertical axes but fill the corners and edges with a specific sequence.
- For instance, if the center has two distinct numbers, say `a` and `b`, then around these numbers, the outer layer would show `b` on the top-left and bottom-right, and `a` on the top-right and bottom-left, and so forth.

Applying this rule to our test case:

We have `3` and `1` in the third row, fourth column, and `2` and `5` in the fourth row, third column. We apply the mirroring rule:
- `5` and `2` will mirror around the central point.
- `1` and `3` will also reflect similarly.

Output:

3e980e27,"To solve this puzzle, let's observe that for each set of non-zero numbers in a column, they seem to move down until they hit the bottom or another non-zero number. Additionally, if there are numbers in the top part of the grid, they can ""fall"" into the gaps below them. Let’s apply this logic to the test case.

Starting with the test case:

Input Grid:
```python

[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

We apply the rules where all non-zero numbers fall downwards, stopping when they encounter the bottom or other non-zero numbers.

bda2d7a6,"To transform the test case grid according to the observed pattern, we first identify the outermost color and the innermost color in the grid. The outermost color in the input grid is 9, and the innermost color is 1. According to the previous examples, the outermost color in the output becomes the border, and the innermost color replaces the original border.

Applying these rules to the test input, 9 (the outermost color) will form the new inner section, while 1 (the innermost color in the original input) will form the new outer border.

a48eeaf7,"To determine the transformation rule from the examples provided, we observe the following:

- In both examples, the color value `5` and `2` seem to move or shift in specific patterns.
- The pattern suggests that if there's a `5` above or below a `2`, `5` shifts upwards or downwards to connect with `2`.

Based on the observations from the training examples, the rule appears to be: 
- All instances of `5` that are adjacent (vertically) to blocks of `2` are moved up or down to meet those `2` blocks, and any standalone `5` not connected to a `2` block gets eliminated.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- We see three `5`s in the test case grid. Two of them are positioned in such a way where they can connect vertically with blocks of `2`.
- Following the rule, the two `5`s connected to `2` blocks will move vertically to align next to the `2`s.

Therefore, the solution for the test case should be:

- The central row (with all 5s) is omitted in each output.
- The rows above and below the central row shift towards the center, merging into half as many rows.
- Each merged row combines the colors from both input rows according to their positions.

Based on this pattern, we can apply the same transformation rule to the test case provided:

Applying the transformation rule:
1. Remove the row of all 5s.
2. Merge two rows at a time, combining them based on color presence.

The output for the test case should be:

2. Of those four columns, any cells that contain a 0 (which represents an empty or transparent color) are kept as 0s, while non-zero values (which represent filled colors) are retained in the corresponding position in the output grid.

Using this rule, let's solve for the test case provided:

94f9d214,"To find the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids, let's analyze the patterns and transformations in the provided examples:

- In all examples, the output grid is smaller than the input grid.
- There is a consistent vertical alignment of elements with value `2` that seems to appear only where specific conditions are met.
- The transformation appears to focus on the column-wise pattern of `3`s at the top of the grid and the presence of `1`s at the bottom that influence the creation of `2`s in the output.

From the previous analysis, it looks like the rule involves focusing on columns containing `3`s at the top and `1`s at the bottom in the input grids. Specifically, `2`s in the output seem to form where there are `3`s at the top and `1`s at the bottom in the corresponding columns of the input grids.

Applying this rule to the test case:

1. Identify columns containing `3`s at the top and `1`s at the bottom. 
2. These specific columns in the input grid should map to the position of `2`s in the output grid.

Given the test case:
```plaintext

e48d4e1a,"To solve the test case, I observe that the transformation applied to the input grids involves shifting the position of the colored pixels (non-zero values) from their original column or row to another position while maintaining their color value.

In all the training examples, the non-zero values (colors) have moved from their initial positions to new positions in such a way that the entire block of a particular color moves to a different column or row but still forms a continuous block. In particular, the color blocks seem to move diagonally to the left or up by one column/row (except for the fully filled row/column which remains unmoved).

Given the test input:
```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5],

```
The color block of 5s seems to be an outlier and does not follow the same pattern of movement as the other color blocks. However, considering the consistent rule observed in the previous examples with regards to movement towards the left or up by one column/row, we can infer that the 8s should also move up or to the left by one column/row.

Therefore, the 8s should move up by one row (since they already form a column), and the 5s, being an outlier, would remain in their place.
Thus, the output would look like:

aedd82e4,"To find the transformation rule from the provided examples, first I observed how the output differs from the input in each example:

- In Example 1, the number '2' in the last row changed to '1'.
- In Example 2, the '2' at the bottom-right corner and the '2' one cell above it changed to '1'.
- In Example 3, only the '2' in position [2, 3] changed to '1', while all other '2's remained unchanged.
- In Example 4, similar to the previous cases, the '2's located at the bottom left and middle of the second row changed to '1'.

From these observations, it seems that the transformation rule involves changing '2' to '1' but only for isolated '2's that do not have another '2' touching them directly horizontally or vertically.

Applying this rule to the test case, we focus on any '2' that does not have another '2' immediately adjacent to it. In the test, there are two such '2's - the one in the top right and the one in the third row, second column.

Thus, the transformed grid should have these two '2's turned into '1's.

681b3aeb,"To solve the puzzle, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the provided examples.

Observations from the examples:
- The transformation seems to focus on extracting the positions of the non-zero elements across the original grid.
- In every example, there are only a few distinct numbers present in the input grid.
- Each output grid is a smaller 3x3 grid made up of these distinct numbers.
- The numbers in the output grid seem to correspond to the relative positions of these numbers in the original larger grid.

By analyzing further, it appears that the output grid is formed by taking the highest value in each third row and column when dividing the grid into 3x3 sections.

Applying this observation to the test case:

Given Test Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

The non-zero elements are `2` and `8`. We take the highest number found in each 3x3 section.

Output:
- Top-left 3x3 has `2`.
- Center 3x3 does not have any non-zero values, but the rule suggests we take the highest one from nearby sections if applicable, but here it's just 0.
- Bottom-right 3x3 has `8`.

Therefore, the transformed output would be:
``` 
Answer: [[2, 0, 8], [0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8]]
```

However, since we only include non-zero elements and the pattern suggests forming a square with only the non-zero values, the output should be:
```
Answer: [[2, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8]]
```

But given the pattern of the previous examples, the final answer should align strictly with the highest non-zero value in each column and row segment.

Thus, the final output is:
```
Answer: ```[[2, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8], [0, 8, 8]]```","[[2 0 8]

c9e6f938,"To solve the given test case, let's analyze the pattern in the examples provided:

1. Each output grid has a height and width that are doubled compared to the input grid.
2. The original input grid seems to occupy the top-left quadrant of the new grid.
3. The bottom-right quadrant of the new grid appears to mirror the top-left quadrant across both horizontal and vertical axes.

Given these observations, let's apply these transformations to the test case input grid:

Test Case Input:
```[
[7, 7, 0],
[0, 7, 0],
[0, 0, 7]]
```

Based on the identified pattern:
- Double the size of the grid to make it 6x6.
- The top left 3x3 area remains the same.
- The bottom right 3x3 area will be a mirrored version (both horizontally and vertically) of the top left quadrant.

So we can construct the output grid as follows:
- Top left quadrant: Unchanged from the input.
- Bottom right quadrant: Mirrored from the input.

Output Grid:
```[
[7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7],

28bf18c6,"To solve the test case, let's understand the transformation rule from the training examples.

In each transformation:
1. The output grid is smaller than the input grid.
2. The pattern of non-zero values is condensed while maintaining their spatial relationship.
3. The output appears to be a 3x6 grid.

From observing the transformations:
- The horizontal and vertical positions of the non-zero elements in the input grid are mapped to a more compact form in the output grid.
- The output seems to be derived by taking every other column and row from the non-empty area of the input grid.

Let's apply this understanding to the test case grid:

Input Grid:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

- In Example 2, the number 6 forms a cross pattern around the initial 3, with 6’s spreading out in all four directions from the central 3.
- In Example 3, the number 9 remains at its original position and spreads to the row below, forming a vertical line.

From these observations, the transformation seems to involve spreading the numbers that are not zero (colors) in a cross or diagonal pattern, ensuring symmetry around the centers of the patterns.

6a1e5592,"To transform the test input into the desired output, let's analyze the pattern changes in the training examples:

1. In both examples, the top row and a part of the next rows remain the same. The value `2` remains unchanged.
2. The `0`s around the `2`s are replaced with `1`s, creating a border of `1`s around the `2`s.
3. The lower section which contains `5`s is transformed such that all `5`s are changed to `0`s and surrounding `0`s are also turned into `1`s.

Following these rules for the test case:

- We keep the top row intact.
- Replace surrounding `0`s with `1`s.
- Lower section `5`s are set to `0`, and their surrounding `0`s are turned into `1`s.

Thus, the solution for the test case would look like:

88a10436,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the pattern or rule used in the transformations from the examples. In each example, non-zero elements below the top half of the grid are moved up to fill the empty spaces above them, preserving their relative positions.

For the test case, we will follow the same logic:

1. Identify the non-zero elements below the middle row.
2. Move them up to the first available row above.

```python
# Test Case
test_input = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

# Determine the number of rows and columns
rows = len(test_input)
cols = len(test_input[0]) if rows > 0 else 0

# Create an empty output grid with the same size
output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]

# Iterate through each column
for col in range(cols):
    # Collect non-zero elements from the input grid
    non_zero_elements = []
    for row in range(rows):
        if test_input[row][col] != 0:
            non_zero_elements.append(test_input[row][col])
    
    # Fill from the top of the column in the output grid
    for i, value in enumerate(non_zero_elements):
        output_grid[i][col] = value

# Final Output
test_output = output_grid
```

The code above will move all the non-zero elements from the test input grid into the output grid starting from the top, thus preserving their order but moving them upwards.

Let's see what `test_output` looks like after running the code:

```python
test_output = [
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

- In Example 1, an 8 at position (2, 2) spreads horizontally and vertically, and a 7 at (6, 6) spreads similarly.
- In Example 2, an 8 at position (1, 3) and a 7 at (7, 6) spread out in a similar fashion.

Given the test case, we have an 8 at (1, 4) and a 7 at (6, 1):

- The 8 should spread horizontally and vertically.
- The 7 should spread horizontally and vertically.

Let's replicate the pattern observed from the training examples to solve the test case:

f8b3ba0a,"To determine the transformation rule used on the input grids to produce the output grids, we must observe the patterns in the training examples.

In all examples, the output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. Each output grid consists of a single column with a few rows, indicating that the transformation involves reducing the information in the original grid to a much simpler form.

Analyzing the outputs in relation to the inputs, we note:
- The numbers in the output do not appear randomly; they correspond to certain numbers in the input grids.
- The output appears to summarize or extract distinct color values from the input grids, often representing the most prominent or significant colors in a certain context.

By looking at the positions where numbers appear in the input grids, we can infer that:
- Numbers in the input grids located in the middle columns often influence the output.

For instance:
- In Example 1, numbers 4, 2, 3 appear in the 7th column (middle) of the input grid, which directly correlates to the output sequence of [4], [2], [3].
- In Example 2, numbers 6, 1, 2 appear in the 8th column (middle) of the input grid, which translates to the output sequence of [6], [1], [2].
- The pattern seems to repeat across other examples.

- They all contain several color clusters (non-zero values).
- The output is a smaller grid with unique colors present in each row of the original grid.

The rule seems to be that for each row in the original grid, the output row contains the unique non-zero colors found in that row, in ascending order.

Applying this rule to the test case:

```python
# Test Input Grid
test_input = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],

# Process the test input to get the unique non-zero values in each row
test_output = []
for row in test_input:
    filtered_row = sorted(set([color for color in row if color != 0]))
    test_output.append(filtered_row)

print(test_output)
```

Executing the above script would yield the following output:

```python

- 1 and 2 are placed above and below the block of 5's, respectively.

f2829549,"To solve the test case, we need to understand the pattern from the given examples. It appears that the transformation focuses on certain columns and rows, replacing values with '3' or '0' based on some condition.

Observing the transformation rules across examples:

- Rows and columns seem to be reduced in size compared to the input.
- In all the examples, the value '3' is introduced only in specific places while the rest are filled with '0'.
- The pattern of '1', '5', and '0' seems to have a role in determining where '3' goes in the output.

In every example, the output grid has exactly 4 rows and 3 columns. It looks like the output is determined by a pattern that involves columns 3, 6 (in the input) and the fourth column consistently. Based on these observations, for the test case:

```
[
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0],
[7, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0],
[7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5]]
```

We can infer:

- The presence of '1' in the fourth column suggests a '0' in the output unless there's a '5' in the sixth column, which then turns into a '3'.
- There's also an apparent focus on the column where '5' is present in the input grid, especially in the sixth position.

Using this logic:
- First row: No '5' in the sixth position, so we get `[0, 0, 0]`.
- Second row: A '5' in the sixth position, hence `[0, 3, 0]`.
- Third row: No '5' in the sixth position, leading to `[0, 0, 0]`.
- Fourth row: Again, a '5' in the sixth position, giving us `[0, 3, 0]`.

Therefore, the solution is:

The transformation changes all `1`s in a connected group to `2`s and ensures that any `0`s adjacent to these groups become `2`s if they are not already part of another contiguous segment of `2`s. However, based on the examples provided, only the topmost and leftmost positions of `0`s seem to transform under certain conditions.

Given the test case:

We see two `1` cells at (0, 1) and (2, 1). According to the transformation pattern, these `1`s should transform into `2`s. Moreover, the `0`s adjacent to these `1`s from the top and left directions should also turn into `2`s. Thus, the first row's zero next to `1` and the zeros directly above and below the `1`s in the middle column should be transformed accordingly.

In each of the examples provided, the output grids appear to be a compressed version of the input where only certain columns and rows are preserved.

dc433765,"To solve the puzzle, observe the pattern in how the transformations from inputs to outputs are made. In each training example, we see that non-zero values (colors) in the input grid are moved toward the center of the grid along their respective rows and columns. Specifically:

1. Non-zero values in the middle column or row stay where they are.
2. If there are non-zero values not in the central row or column, they shift inward one position towards the center.

For Example 6, the transformation moves all non-zero numbers (3 and 4) horizontally closer to the middle column, leaving them on the same row but shifting them leftwards. The value '4' did not move because it was already in the middle column.

Applying this logic to the test case, we should move the number '3' from column 3 to column 5, and '4' remains in its place because it's in the middle column.

Observations from the Training Examples:
1. There's an expansion or replacement process based on a specific pattern.
2. In Example 1, a '1' expands to fill spaces to the right until another non-zero element is encountered.
3. In Example 2, there's a similar expansion but with '3', which fills the topmost rows until it encounters non-zero elements.
4. In Example 3, a '2' spreads downwards filling the cells below the '3' pattern.

Applying these observations to the test case:

- We have an isolated '4' at position [11][4].
- This '4' will expand downwards and fill the cells beneath it until it encounters a non-zero number.
- The '8' at the center of the '4' pattern will not change because it is neither expanding nor filling empty spaces around it.

Given this, the '4' will fill all the cells below it down to the edge or until another non-zero is encountered.

42a50994,"To determine the transformation rule from the input grids to the output grids, I observed that in each example, certain elements are removed or changed based on their position and value. After careful analysis, it appeared that the rule involves removing an 8 or another number if it has a specific number of neighbors (in the 4 directions - up, down, left, right) of the same value.

For the test case provided, I'll apply the following rule: if a cell contains a 3 and it's not vertically aligned with any other 3 above or below it, it should be replaced with a 0.

Using this rule:

```python
input_grid = [
    [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3],

1caeab9d,"To transform the input grid into the output grid, we need to bring the colored blocks together horizontally into the leftmost positions in their respective rows, maintaining their relative order and shape.

Let's apply this transformation rule to our test case:

- We first identify all non-zero elements in a row.
- Then, we shift these non-zero elements as far left as possible in that row while preserving the order and grouping all zeros to the right.

Applying this rule to the test case:

```python

1. Surround the existing pattern with an alternating diagonal pattern of 7s and 8s.
2. For positions with original 7s, they remain unchanged (as 7s).
3. All other positions are filled with 0s if they're not part of the new surrounding pattern.

To solve the provided test case, I'll follow these rules:

Applying the transformation:

- Start with the 7 at the center of the right side column and surround it with an alternating diagonal pattern of 7s and 8s.
- Fill the rest with zeros where needed.

The resulting transformed grid would look like this:

``` [

[0, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 0, 0],

Specifically, the outputs show the largest continuous cluster of non-zero numbers (ignoring the zeros) found in the original grid, organized into a square or near-square shape.

In the test case provided, we have two clusters of interest: one with '3' and another with '2'. The largest continuous cluster consists of the '3's located in the top-left corner, while the '2's make up another cluster located at the bottom-middle part of the grid.

Given that the output format is a 3x3 grid, the '3' cluster fits perfectly within the center of the 3x3 grid when transformed. Here's the transformed grid:

7e0986d6,"To understand the transformation rule applied in the given examples, we need to analyze how the input grids become the output grids:

In both examples, the transformation seems to involve replacing certain specific color patterns with another type of pattern, particularly focusing on removing or changing the presence of specific colors (like 8 in Example 1, and 1 in Example 2).

By analyzing the differences:

1. In Example 1, all occurrences of the number '8' are removed from the input grid, and the grid is simplified to only contain '0's and '3's.
2. Similarly, in Example 2, numbers '1's are mostly removed, and the grid simplifies mainly to contain '0's and '2's.

Following this pattern for the test case:
- We can see that '4's and '5's are present.
- Following the previous rules, if we treat '4's similarly to how '8's and '1's were treated, the transformation should remove or replace '4's.

Therefore, the solution for the test case should follow the same logic, where all '4's are removed, resulting in a grid that simplifies to only contain '0's and '5's.

The test case solution would then look like this:

In each example, the output grid is larger than the input grid and the pattern of numbers shifts diagonally towards the bottom right corner with each row added. More specifically, the first element of each new row is shifted one position to the right from the previous row, and the elements that have no corresponding value in the original input grid are filled with zeroes.

For the test case, we need to follow the same shifting pattern and add three more rows and columns to match the size of previous output examples, which are 6x6 grids.

99fa7670,"To solve the test case, I analyzed the transformation applied to the training examples. The transformation seems to involve extending the non-zero colored cells horizontally to the right and vertically downwards until it reaches a boundary or another non-zero color.

Based on the patterns from the provided examples, here's how the transformation appears to work for the test case:

- Starting with the 8 in position (0, 3), extend it to the right and down to cover all positions up to and including the rightmost column and bottommost row.
- Next, starting with the 7 at (2, 2), fill its row to the right and extend its column downwards, but stop before reaching the previously filled 8s.
- Continue with the 2 at position (4, 5), filling its row to the right and extending its column downward, stopping before any other filled areas.

Applying these rules to the test case, we get the following transformed grid:

Answer: ```[[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]]```","[[0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8]

beb8660c,"To solve the test case, we need to observe the transformation pattern used in the examples provided:

In each example, the transformation rule appears to involve removing all rows containing only zeros except for the bottommost non-zero row. Then, all remaining blocks of numbers (groups of numbers with the same value) are moved down to fill the gaps, starting from the bottom of the grid.

Using this insight, let's analyze and transform the given test case accordingly.

Test Case Input:

Applying the observed rule:
- Remove all empty rows except for the bottommost one.
- Move groups of numbers down to fill the gaps starting from the bottom.

4522001f,"To solve this puzzle, we need to understand how the transformation works from the given input to the output. Observing the provided examples, we can see that the output grid is always a 9x9 grid, and it seems to be an expansion or replication of the pattern in the input grid.

From the examples, it's clear that for every non-zero element in the input grid, the output grid has a corresponding 3x3 block filled with that color. Additionally, zeros in the input do not generate any colored blocks in the output grid. Zeros appear to fill the rest of the output grid.

Given this understanding, let's apply the transformation to the test case:

Test Case: Input
[
[0, 3, 3],
[0, 2, 3],
[0, 0, 0]
]

The transformation would create a 9x9 output grid as follows:
- The top-left 3x3 block is all zeros (no color).
- The second column of 3x3 blocks is filled with 3s.
- The third column of 3x3 blocks is also filled with 3s.
- There's a middle row where the middle 3x3 block is filled with 2s.

1f0c79e5,"To solve the test case, we need to understand the pattern used in transforming the input grid into the output grid based on the training examples provided.

From the examples, we can observe that for each instance of a non-zero value in the input, there is a corresponding outward expansion of that value starting from the position of the non-zero value until all surrounding positions are filled up to the grid boundary or encounter another non-zero value of a different color. However, for the non-zero value to expand, there must be a pair of non-zero values with at least one being a distinct primary color that isn't 2 (the secondary value), which seems to act as a placeholder for expansion.

Given these observations, let's apply this transformation rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The value '8' will be the primary value that expands outwards, while the '2's will serve as placeholders.

239be575,"To identify the transformation rule, let's analyze the training examples provided:

1. In Example 1, we see colors 0, 2, and 8. The output is a grid with only color 0.
2. In Example 2, we see colors 0, 2, and 8. The output is a grid with only color 8.
3. Similarly in Example 3, we see colors 0, 2, and 8. The output is a grid with only color 8.
4. In Example 4, we see colors 0, 2, and 8, but the output is a grid with only color 0.
5. In Example 5, we see colors 0, 2, and 8. The output is a grid with only color 8.
6. In Example 6, we see colors 0, 2, and 8. The output is a grid with only color 0.

The pattern seems to be that if there's a dominant color (appearing more often), the output shows a grid with that dominant color, except when the non-dominant color is 0, in which cases 0 dominates. 

Applying this rule to the test case:
- Counting the number of appearances of each color:
   - Color 0 appears 17 times.
   - Color 2 appears 9 times.
   - Color 8 appears 16 times.

Since color 0 appears most frequently, the output should be a grid containing just color 0.

Therefore, the predicted output for the test case is a grid with color 0.

d4469b4b,"To find the pattern or transformation rule from the provided examples, let's break down what we observe:

- All input grids are 5x5.
- All output grids are 3x3.
- The output grids contain only two types of numbers: `0` and `5`.
- The transformation seems to be related to collapsing and summarizing information from the input grid into the output grid.

From careful analysis of the examples, we can infer that the transformation involves counting non-zero elements in blocks of the input grid, and then representing these counts in a simplified form in the output grid where `5` represents ""presence"" or ""existence"" of non-zero elements in any part of the corresponding block and `0` means absence.

Specifically, we break the input 5x5 grid into 9 parts, each a 2x2 or 2x3 or 3x2 or 3x3 subgrid depending on where they fall within the boundaries. Then, for each of these 9 parts, if there is at least one non-zero element, the corresponding cell in the 3x3 output grid is mapped to `5`, otherwise it remains `0`.

Given the test case:
```python
[
[1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
]
```

We map this according to the derived rule:
- First row of the output grid (3 cells) would be `5` because there are non-zero elements in all three 2x2 blocks.
- Second row of the output grid would be `5, 0, 5` since the middle block has no non-zero elements but the other two have.
- Third row of the output grid would also be `5, 0, 5` for the same reasons.

Therefore, the answer should be:
```python
[
[5, 5, 5],
[5, 0, 5],
[5, 0, 5]
]
```

So the final answer is:

Answer: ``` [[5, 5, 5], [5, 0, 5], [5, 0, 5]] ```","[[5 5 5]

90f3ed37,"To solve the puzzle, we need to identify the pattern in how the outputs differ from their corresponding inputs. Observing the examples closely, it appears that the transformation rule involves filling in the gaps around certain patterns with the value `1`.

In particular, whenever there is a contiguous block of `8`s that is not filled up to the edge, the space below or to the right of the block gets filled with `1`s, extending the block until it reaches an edge. This happens for blocks that have at least one side open (i.e., not touching the edge of the grid).

Given this understanding, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Observations from the training examples:
- The output grid size is 9x9, regardless of the input grid size.
- Each non-zero number in the input grid corresponds to a central ""cross"" pattern in the output grid. The cross extends horizontally and vertically from the center of the 3x3 block corresponding to that number.
- If an input number is 0, it doesn't create any cross pattern in the output; rather, it leaves that section clear.

27a28665,"To solve the test case provided, we need to identify the transformation rule applied in the training examples.

The transformation rule appears to be calculating a specific characteristic or attribute from the input grid and summarizing it into a single number in the output grid. Observing the examples closely:

- Example 1 and Example 6 both have a central 5 surrounded by zeros and other fives, producing an output [1].
- Example 2 and Example 3 have the number 8 and 5 respectively, but in a similar pattern (forming a cross shape), producing an output [2].
- Example 4 and Example 5 both have a pattern where there are two groups of numbers (1s and 8s) with zeros separating them, resulting in an output [3].
- Example 7 has three rows of 5s with zeros above and below, resulting in an output [6].

Given this information, let's apply the rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
[
[0, 8, 0],
[8, 8, 8],
[0, 8, 0]]

This test case has a similar structure to Example 7, in that there are three rows of 8s with zeros above and below the central row of 8s. Based on the patterns seen before, the output should also be [6] since it follows a similar structure to Example 7.

Therefore, the transformed output for the test case should be:

Answer: ``` [[6]] ```",[[6]],True,True,1.0
cdecee7f,"To derive the transformation rule, let's examine the pattern between the input and output grids in the training examples provided:

1. **Identify Non-zero Elements**: Each of the outputs seems to collect non-zero elements from the input grid.
2. **Arrange Elements by Quadrants**: There seems to be an arrangement of these non-zero elements based on their quadrant positions in the input grid.

Analyzing the examples:
- In Example 1, we see that elements 3, 1, and 8 appear in the first row of the output, which seems to come from the leftmost column (or top quadrant), middle column (or center quadrant), and rightmost column (or bottom-right quadrant) respectively.
- Similarly, elements 9, 7, and 6 appear in the second row, corresponding to the bottom-left, middle, and top-right quadrants.
- The third row in all examples shows zeros, suggesting that if there are no elements in the corresponding quadrant of the input grid, the output fills with zero.

Based on this, the transformation rule appears to be:
1. Group the elements by quadrants: Top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.
2. Collect non-zero elements from each quadrant and arrange them in the output grid starting from the top-left quadrant to the bottom-right.

Applying this rule to the Test case:
- The non-zero elements are: 5, 9, 1, 2, 6, 3, 5, 4, 9.
- Arranged by quadrants and order:
  - Top-left quadrant: 5
  - Top-right quadrant: 9
  - Bottom-left quadrant: 2
  - Bottom-right quadrant: 6
  - Center row/column: 3, 5, 4, 9

Thus, the output for the test case should be:
```python
[[5, 9, 1],
 [2, 6, 3],
 [5, 4, 9]]
```

However, according to the pattern observed, since some quadrants may not have enough elements, we fill in with zeros where necessary.

Hence, the final output is:

b60334d2,"To derive the solution for the test case, I analyzed the patterns that occur in the transformation from input grids to output grids. The transformation seems to involve replicating a pattern around the original non-zero number positions (5s in this case) with alternating numbers (0s and 1s).

In the transformed output, each '5' appears surrounded by a '1' on either side, forming an alternating pattern of 5, 1, 5 and 1, 0, 1 when they spread horizontally or vertically.

Applying this transformation rule to the provided test case:

5614dbcf,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the pattern used in transforming the provided input grids into their respective output grids. Observing the training examples, we can deduce that:

- The output grid seems to contain the distinct central elements from each block (3x3 sub-grid) of the input grid.
- The output grid is much smaller than the input grid, suggesting that certain elements are being picked out from larger regions.

Let's apply this understanding to the test case.

Given Test Case Input:
```

[0, 0, 0, 9, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]]

We'll extract the central element from each 3x3 block.

1st Block:
```
[4, 4, 4],
[5, 4, 4],
[4, 4, 4]
```
Central Element: 4

2nd Block:
```

a740d043,"Upon analyzing the provided examples, I can deduce that the transformation rule from the input to the output grids involves extracting the non-background (non-1) elements into a smaller grid, preserving their relative positions.

In the examples:

- The number ""1"" seems to be considered as background and is removed.
- Other numbers maintain their relative positions but only those within the smallest bounding box containing all non-""1"" numbers are taken.

Based on this rule, let's solve the test case:

The non-""1"" elements form a small rectangle at the center of the grid:
- (2, 3) -> 2
- (3, 2) -> 2
- (3, 3) -> 3

In each transformation, it appears that only certain numbers are retained while others are replaced with zeros. Specifically, it seems that the transformation retains only one number throughout the grid, which appears to be the most frequent or strategically important number based on its placement and frequency.

Upon closer inspection:

- In Example 1, the number `2` is retained.
- In Example 2, the number `2` is retained.
- In Example 3, the number `2` is retained.

Given that the number `2` is consistently retained in each of these transformations, let's apply this rule to the test case.

7c008303,"To solve the test case, let's observe the pattern in the transformations from the inputs to the outputs in the training examples.

The rule seems to be that the output is a smaller grid where some specific columns and rows are selected from the input grid, and certain patterns are maintained or translated. Particularly, there appears to be a selection of columns and rows based on the presence or absence of specific colors (numbers), especially focusing on the color transitions.

In each of the training examples, the output seems to retain some structure based on the color '8' which is present in the middle row/columns across all examples. Thereafter, the remaining parts of the grid are filled with other numbers, which seem to reflect certain patterns from the original grid.

Let's apply this understanding to the test case:

Input for Test Case:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 7]]
```

Based on the observed pattern, we select the columns and rows that have color transitions around the '8' pattern. Specifically, the output seems to keep the '8' column and its surrounding colors and patterns.

Thus, our output could be formed by selecting the appropriate columns/rows and transforming them accordingly into the new grid size as seen in the training examples.

8be77c9e,"To solve this transformation puzzle, we need to recognize the pattern between the input and output grids. In all provided examples, the transformation involves first duplicating the rows of the input grid in reverse order, and then adding these duplicates to the bottom of the original grid. This creates a symmetric structure where the top half matches the input, and the bottom half mirrors it upside-down.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Test Case: Input
```[ 
[0, 0, 0], 
[0, 0, 1], 
[1, 0, 0]

- First, mirror the input grid upside-down:
```[ 
[1, 0, 0], 
[0, 0, 1], 
[0, 0, 0] 
]```
- Then add this mirrored grid below the original grid:

[0, 0, 1], 
[1, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 0],

In all the provided examples, the first non-zero row and column establish a base pattern of three numbers that is repeated across the entire grid in a cyclic manner.
- Example 1 has `2, 8, 3` repeating.
- Example 2 has `2, 4, 1` repeating.
- Example 3 has `4, 8, 3` repeating.

For the test case, the first non-zero entries form a sequence of `1, 2`. Since there are only two unique non-zero values, we can infer that the pattern will be `1, 2`.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the entire grid as follows:

cf98881b,"To derive the transformation rule that maps the provided input grids to the output grids, let's analyze the changes made in the training examples.

In all provided examples, a pattern emerges in which the input grid is reduced to an output grid with only a few specific columns retained, and sometimes, values within those columns are changed or selected based on some criteria.

Upon closer inspection, it seems that each output grid retains columns from positions 0, 3, 8, and 13 of the input grid, but further transformations occur:

- Column 0 is retained.
- Column 3 is retained, but some zeros are replaced with nines.
- Column 8 is retained, but some zeros are replaced with ones.
- Column 13 is retained, but some zeros are replaced with ones.

The exact replacement rules (0 to 9, 0 to 1) vary per column and example, suggesting a complex decision making process or specific conditions for transformation.

Taking these observations into account, we'll apply the same transformation rule to the test case grid.

Here's how the transformation would look for the test case grid:

```python
input_grid = [
    [0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 9, 0, 9, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [4, 4, 0, 4, 2, 9, 9, 9, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 4, 4, 0, 2, 9, 0, 9, 9, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]
]

# Extract columns 0, 3, 8, 13 and apply the transformation
output_grid = []
for row in input_grid:
    transformed_row = [row[0], row[3], row[8], row[13]]
    # Apply transformations based on observed patterns
    if transformed_row[1] == 0:
        transformed_row[1] = 9

    if transformed_row[3] == 0:
        transformed_row[3] = 1
    output_grid.append(transformed_row)

print(output_grid)
```

d0f5fe59,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze how each example input is transformed into its respective output.

The output grids appear to be smaller matrices where each non-zero value from the original grid is reduced to a single representation in the output grid. Specifically:

1. The output grid seems to capture unique rows and columns where non-zero values are present.
2. Each non-zero value in the input (regardless of how many times it appears) results in a '1' at a corresponding position in the output grid if that row and column combination hasn't been marked before.

Given these observations, we need to check the test case for non-zero entries and translate their presence into the output grid:

caa06a1f,"Based on the examples provided, the transformation rule applied to the input grids appears to be a rotation of the pattern that exists in the left part of the grid. The pattern rotates by 90 degrees clockwise, and then it is repeated across the entire grid while keeping the constant color (in these cases '3') in the rightmost columns or bottom rows intact.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

1. Identify the repeating pattern in the input grid.
2. Rotate this pattern 90 degrees clockwise.
3. Apply the rotated pattern to the entire grid, except for the constant color part (which is '3' in the test case).

Here is the resulting grid after applying the rule:

05f2a901,"Based on the examples provided, the transformation rule appears to be that all non-zero regions in the grids are shifted upwards as far as possible without overlapping other non-zero regions.

For the test case:

The non-zero regions are:
- A single cell with value 2 at position (4, 5)
- A region with two cells containing 2s at positions (5, 5) and (5, 6)
- A region with four cells containing 8s and 2s at positions (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 1), and (7, 2)

These regions need to be shifted up.

After shifting:
- The single cell with value 2 moves up to position (0, 5).
- The region with two cells containing 2s moves up to positions (1, 5) and (1, 6).

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

The first two rows of the test case are all zeros, so they remain unchanged in the output.

For the third row `[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, we repeat the subsequence `[2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]` to fill the row.

For the fourth row `[6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, we repeat the subsequence `[6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2]`.

cce03e0d,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grid to produce the output grid, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1** shows that the output grid is a 9x9 grid with each row representing a potential combination of the original 3x3 grid but with zeros filling most of the space, except for the specific rows corresponding to the original rows where they are placed in positions that align with their row number in the original grid.

2. **Example 2** also presents a 9x9 grid but rearranges the rows of the original 3x3 grid into the larger grid, keeping them in the same relative position but inserting additional rows of zeros to fill the grid.

3. **Example 3** follows the same pattern, showing the original rows in a 9x9 grid with zeros in the gaps, suggesting that the transformation rule involves expanding the grid while maintaining the original row structure and placing the rows in the same relative positions.

Based on these observations, the transformation seems to involve expanding the original 3x3 grid into a 9x9 grid by repeating the rows of the original grid in the same position, but with zeros padded around them to complete the rows.

Applying this transformation to the given test case:

feca6190,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the transformation pattern from the input grid to the output grid. Let's analyze the examples.

In all cases, each non-zero element in the input grid is transformed into a cross-like structure in the output grid where the element itself appears in its original position with zeros around it, extending to the edges of a square grid that encompasses all the non-zero elements. The size of this grid is equal to the number of non-zero elements plus their count minus one, which essentially means the grid will grow larger based on the quantity of numbers present.

The pattern is as follows:

1. Create an output grid with the dimensions (N + N - 1) x (N + N - 1), where N is the number of non-zero numbers in the input.
2. Place each non-zero number at its corresponding position as if it was the center of a growing cross. The first number starts at position `[0][0]`, then the next one at `[1][1]` and so on, shifting the non-zero elements diagonally up and to the right.
3. Fill the rest of the positions with zeros.

For the test case:

Input:
```
[
[0, 6, 7, 8, 9]]
```

We can follow the same pattern:

- There are 4 non-zero elements in the input grid.
- The output grid will have dimensions (4 + 4 - 1) x (4 + 4 - 1) = 7 x 7.
- We place each non-zero element at positions `[0][1]`, `[1][2]`, `[2][3]`, and `[3][4]`.

- Similarly, in Example 2, the central row has `3, 8, 4, 2` which is cycled horizontally.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- We start from the center and move upwards to find the first non-zero values.
- The sequence encountered moving up from `[6][5]` to `[7][6]` is `4, 2, 3, 1`.
- We will then fill in the central row (`[6]`) with this sequence cycled horizontally: `4, 2, 3, 1`.

Therefore, the solution for the test case is:

6e02f1e3,"To find the pattern in how the outputs are derived from the inputs, observe that:

- When the 3x3 input grid has a single consistent color throughout, the output seems to either place 5's at specific corners or fill the top row with 5s and the rest with 0s.
- In cases where there are multiple colors, the 5s appear only in positions that correspond to certain patterns of the original colors, and the rest are filled with 0s.

Let's analyze the transformation more closely:

1. **Single color grids**: 
   - If the entire grid is a single color (such as all 4s or all 3s), the output places 5s across the top row and 0s elsewhere (Example 3 and 4).

2. **Mixed color grids**:
   - If there's a mixture of colors, the 5s seem to be placed strategically based on the distribution of colors in the input. For instance, Example 2 has 5s at the bottom-left and middle-center positions for a mixture of 3s and 4s.

For the given test case:
```python
[
[4, 4, 4],
[2, 3, 2],
[3, 2, 3]]
```
Given the pattern observed:
- The top row is entirely 4s, so we should expect 5s in the output's top row.
- The rest of the grid contains a mix of 2s and 3s, which might follow a specific placement strategy.

However, based on the patterns seen in the provided examples (especially Example 2 and 5 where a mixed pattern with 2s, 3s, and 4s results in sporadic placement of 5s), the output could likely be structured similarly.

Based on these observations and the consistency of patterns, the solution to the test case would be:

aba27056,"To solve the test case, we first need to identify the pattern or rule applied in transforming the input grids to the output grids from the training examples. We notice that the transformation involves the introduction of color `4` into regions of the grid that do not contain a pre-existing color (besides `0`). Specifically:

- Color `4` appears to fill voids and surrounds certain existing colored areas (like `6` or `7` in the examples).
- The `4`s don't overwrite or replace the original colors (like `6` or `7`), but fill the surrounding areas that are initially zeros.

Applying this understanding to the test case:

The test input has a vertical line with `2`s. The transformation should involve filling the surrounding area with `4`s while leaving the `2`s intact.

Here's how the test grid should be transformed:
```python

[0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

Transforming it according to the observed rule:

2dc579da,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the provided examples.

Observing the transformations in the training examples, we can see a pattern. The output grids appear to be slices taken from the center of the input grids. Specifically, the output grid retains only the central vertical and horizontal lines of the input grid, excluding the outermost borders.

Let's apply this rule to our test case:

1. Identify the central part of the grid.
2. Extract the middle column and row (and their surrounding immediate neighbors if necessary to maintain symmetry).

For the test case input:

```python
[
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]
```
The central column (index 6) and central row (index 6) are:
- Column 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

We extract the central block with these elements:
```python
[
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 0, 0],

2013d3e2,"To find a pattern, let's examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the provided examples.

In Example 1, the input grid has patterns centered around the middle. When we look at the output, we can see that the numbers from the inner part of the input are extracted and placed into a smaller 3x3 grid.

Likewise, for Example 2, the non-zero elements from the core part of the larger grid have been transformed into a smaller 3x3 grid, discarding all zeros and keeping only certain significant values.

The transformation appears to take the central 5x5 section of the input grid (for both examples) and reduce it into a 3x3 grid with some values omitted. It looks like it selects the outermost non-zero numbers of this central area while omitting some interior ones.

Let's apply this to the Test Case:

The central region of the Test Case input is:
```
[
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[4, 4, 8, 4, 0],
[8, 8, 3, 3, 4],
[0, 4, 3, 3, 8],
[0, 4, 8, 4, 0]
]
```

Based on the earlier pattern, let's select the outermost non-zero numbers into a new 3x3 grid:
- Top left element is `8` from row 1.
- Top right element is `8` from row 1.
- Middle left element is `4` from row 2.
- Middle right element is `4` from row 2.
- Bottom left element is `8` from row 4.
- Bottom right element is `8` from row 4.

Constructing the output:
```
[
[8, 0, 8],
[0, 4, 0],
[8, 0, 8]
]
```

However, considering the previous examples, it seems that the middle of the grid is taken as the center value:
- Center value is `3`.

So the final 3x3 grid would be:
```
[
[8, 0, 8],
[0, 3, 0],
[8, 0, 8]
]
```

Therefore, the solution for the Test Case is:

62c24649,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the transformation rule from the provided training examples. Observing the transformations:

- The output grid's dimensions are doubled compared to the input grid.
- The outer rows and columns mirror their adjacent inner rows and columns.
- The middle section of the output grid mirrors the pattern of the input grid but expanded in both directions.

Applying these rules to the test case input:
```plaintext

```
We can infer the following steps for the transformation:
1. Expand the dimensions to double the size (6x6).
2. Mirror the edges accordingly.

Starting with the first row `[1, 1, 0]`, it should mirror to `[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.
The second row `[0, 3, 2]` mirrors to `[0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0]`.

1. In each input, we notice that the output consists of a single row.
2. This row seems to capture some form of horizontal summary or reduced view of the entire input grid.

By closely examining the numbers in the output, we notice that the output row usually contains a sequence of 1s followed by 0s. The length of the 1s seems to correlate with how many columns across the input grid have at least one non-zero element appearing anywhere within them.

- Example 1: Only the first, second, and ninth columns have non-zero values when considered across all rows, resulting in `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`.
- Example 2: The first four columns have at least one non-zero value, leading to the result `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]`.

Applying this observation to the test input:
- First column has non-zero values.
- Second column has non-zero values.
- Third column has no non-zero values.
- Fourth column has no non-zero values.
- Fifth column has non-zero values.
- Sixth column has non-zero values.
- Seventh column has non-zero values.
- Eighth column does not have non-zero values.
- Ninth column has no non-zero values.

Based on these observations, the output should summarize that the first five columns have non-zero values and the last four do not. Thus the output would be:
Answer: ```[[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]]``` 

However, following the pattern of the previous examples where the output summarizes the first few columns having non-zero values:
Answer: ```[[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]]```",[[1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0]],True,False,0.0
a8c38be5,"To find the transformation rule from the input grids to the output grids, we need to analyze the pattern or logic applied in the training examples.

From both examples, it seems that:

1. The dimensions of the output grid are smaller than those of the input grid.
2. The transformation appears to take clusters of similar numbers and condense them into smaller formations while maintaining their relative positions and shapes.
3. The transformation also seems to involve a kind of rotation and re-arrangement of these clusters based on some pattern.

Given these observations, let's apply the inferred rule to transform the test case input grid:

Test Case Input Grid:
```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 5, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 1, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 5, 5, 0, 5, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 5, 8, 5, 0, 5, 5, 1, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 0],
[0, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 5, 0],
[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

The transformed grid should maintain the shape and position of clusters of numbers similarly to the training examples. The resulting output would resemble a condensed form of the input cluster formations.

The Test Case Output Grid could be:
```python
[[4, 4, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 7, 7],
 [4, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 7, 7],
 [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
 [6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3],
 [6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3],
 [6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3],
 [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
 [1, 5, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 5, 9],
 [1, 1, 5, 3, 3, 3, 5, 9, 9]]

2281f1f4,"To solve this problem, we need to observe the pattern in which the transformation from the input grid to the output grid occurs. Observing the provided examples closely:

1. For positions where the color is `5`, the transformation does not change these positions.
2. Positions that are directly above the `5`s, when they are `0`, get changed to `2`.

Based on this observation, the rule seems to be:
- If there is a `5` below a `0`, replace that `0` with `2`.
- Keep all other cells the same.

Applying this rule to the test case:

```python
input_grid = [
    [5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],

    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
]

# Apply the transformation rule
output_grid = []
for i in range(len(input_grid)):
    row = []
    for j in range(len(input_grid[i])):
        if i > 0 and input_grid[i][j] == 0 and input_grid[i-1][j] == 5:
            row.append(2)
        else:
            row.append(input_grid[i][j])
    output_grid.append(row)

print(""Answer: "", output_grid)
```

This would produce the following transformation:

```python

f25ffba3,"The pattern observed in the transformation from the input to the output grids involves flipping the rows of the grid around the middle row so that the top half mirrors the bottom half, with the middle row staying in place if there is an odd number of rows.

Applying the same rule to the test case:

1. Identify the middle point.
2. Flip around the middle point.

For a grid with 10 rows, we flip rows such that the first becomes the last, the second becomes the second to last, etc., keeping the middle two rows (5th and 6th here) in place.

Using this rule on the test case:

```python

dc1df850,"To derive the transformation rule from the provided examples, one can observe that the transformation seems to involve filling in zeros with ones based on proximity to non-zero elements, but only up to certain limits. This pattern resembles a flood fill algorithm or a form of boundary detection.

Examining the patterns:
- The zeros adjacent to or near non-zero numbers (2, 6, 3, 7, 8) are filled with ones.
- The filling does not extend beyond a certain limit, which seems to depend on the position of the non-zero values.
- Non-zero values themselves remain unchanged.

b7249182,"To solve the test case, let's first observe the pattern in the training examples.

In all the examples, any non-zero value that appears in an otherwise zero-filled grid is being used to ""grow"" or ""expand"" into neighboring cells creating a symmetric shape around its original position with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes. For instance, if a single 2 appears somewhere in the grid, the output includes a symmetrical spread of those 2s centered at where they originally appeared.

Given this pattern, for the test case which has two non-zero numbers 7 and 6, we can expect similar expansion:

- The number '7' will expand to create a symmetric shape vertically and horizontally.
- Similarly, the number '6' will also expand but independently from the '7'.

f9012d9b,"Firstly, observing the given pairs of input and output grids, we can determine that the transformation rule seems to involve taking a section or pattern from the original grid and simplifying it into a smaller output grid. 

In Example 1, the output consists of the central pattern `[1, 1]` and `[2, 1]`, where the center of the larger pattern repeats.

For Example 2, there is a clear alternation between `8` and `6`, but only one value, `8`, is chosen for the output, which suggests that perhaps the most common or first occurring color in the alternating pattern may be selected.

The third example shows a more complex pattern, but again, the output grid seems to capture a specific pattern within the larger grid.

Given these observations, for the Test case, I notice a similar alternating pattern with values `8` and `1`. I'll focus on the central repeating section of this pattern and ignore the zeros, assuming they are to be discarded or ignored.

Following the observed pattern:
- In the first few rows, we see an alternating pattern of `8`s and `1`s.
- There's a noticeable repetition of patterns in columns and rows.

To determine the central pattern:
- In row 4 onwards, the pattern stabilizes with a sequence `8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8`.
- This sequence repeats in column-wise fashion too, with `8` and `1`.

Based on these observations, we can derive a smaller, simplified grid that captures the essence of the pattern:

0520fde7,"The transformation rule applied to the training examples seems to involve counting certain patterns or conditions within the input grid and then generating a new, smaller grid based on those counts or conditions.

From the examples provided, we can see that the output grid is always a 3x3 grid. Each cell in the output grid seems to depend on specific columns of the input grid. Specifically, it appears that if there are at least two consecutive non-zero values (excluding the value `5` which seems to act as some kind of separator), the corresponding position in the output matrix is marked with a `2`. If there are no such patterns, the value is set to `0`.

Let's analyze the test case using this rule:

Test Case Input:
```
[
[1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
[1, 0, 1, 5, 0, 1, 0]
]
```

To derive the output:
- In the first column (indices 0, 3, 6), we have `[1, 0, 1]` with one non-zero pair.
- In the second column (indices 1, 4, 7), we have `[0, 1, 0]` with no non-zero pairs.
- In the third column (indices 2, 5, 8), we have `[1, 0, 1]` with one non-zero pair.

Based on this pattern, the output should be:
```
[
[0, 0, 0],
[2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2]
]
```

Therefore, the answer for the test case is:

47c1f68c,"To determine the transformation rule based on the provided training examples, let's analyze the patterns:

1. **Identify the Middle Row/Column**: In each input, there is a ""middle"" row that contains a continuous sequence of a non-zero value (e.g., 2, 8, 4, 3) which appears in every cell of that row. This row corresponds to the central part of the grid.
2. **Reflect Across Middle Row**: The output grids seem to reflect across this middle row, excluding the row with the continuous sequence itself.
3. **Remove Extra Columns**: The output removes an outer column from each side compared to the input, aligning with the reflection process.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Following the identified pattern, we see:
- The middle row is the one with all 3s.
- Reflect the rows above and below the middle row while removing the outer columns.

Output:

d89b689b,"To derive the transformation rule from the provided examples, we observe that the non-zero values from the outer edges of the input grids are moved to specific positions in the center of the output grid. Specifically:

1. Non-zero elements from the four sides of the grid are collected.
2. These collected elements are placed in pairs in the central area of the output grid around the coordinates (4,4), while maintaining their relative positioning order.

For instance, when looking at Example 1, the numbers 6, 7, 4, and 9 are present on the sides of the input grid, and they are transformed into pairs (6, 7) and (4, 9) in the output grid's central area.

Applying this rule to the Test case input, we gather the non-zero numbers from the edges:

- From the top edge: No non-zero numbers.
- From the right edge: 4.
- From the bottom edge: 7.
- From the left edge: 3, 6.

These non-zero numbers (3, 4, 6, 7) will be placed in pairs in the center:
- First pair (3, 4) will be placed at the coordinates (4,4).
- Second pair (6, 7) will be placed at the coordinates (5,4).

In each of the examples, the output grid seems to consist of the unique non-zero numbers from the original larger grid, arranged in a smaller 3x3 grid. Specifically:
- The top-left cell of the output is the number at the second row and seventh column of the input.
- The top-middle cell of the output is the number at the third row and eighth column of the input.
- The top-right cell of the output is the number at the third row and ninth column of the input.
- The middle-left cell of the output is the number at the fourth row and seventh column of the input.
- The middle-middle cell of the output is the number at the fifth row and sixth column of the input.
- The middle-right cell of the output is the number at the fifth row and ninth column of the input.
- The bottom-left cell of the output is the number at the seventh row and eighth column of the input.

More specifically, the elements at the positions (1,1), (1,5), (4,1), and (4,5) of the input grids are used to form the output grids. These elements are taken and arranged in a smaller 2x2 grid.

Let's confirm the pattern using the training examples:

- Example 1: Input elements at (1,1), (1,5), (4,1), (4,5) are `2, 2, 0, 2` respectively.
- Example 2: Input elements at (1,1), (1,5), (4,1), (4,5) are `1, 0, 1, 1` respectively.
- Example 3: Input elements at (1,1), (1,5), (4,1), (4,5) are `8, 8, 8, 0` respectively.

From these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule: take the elements in the first row at columns 1 and 5, and the fourth row at columns 1 and 5, and create a 2x2 grid with them in the order they are extracted.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:

8403a5d5,"To determine the transformation rule based on the provided examples:

1. All zeros in the input grid seem to be replaced with either zeros or a specific pattern of numbers.
2. There's a single non-zero number in each input grid at various positions.
3. In the output, the non-zero number spreads out and alternates with zeros horizontally, and sometimes a 5 appears in specific positions.

From the given examples, we can infer the following rules:
- The non-zero number spreads across the row and column where it originally appeared.
- Every other cell in that row and column gets filled with the non-zero number.
- The number 5 appears in specific alternating cells in both directions (horizontal and vertical).

For the test case, the non-zero number is 1, located at position [9][2] (0-indexed). Applying the inferred rules to this test case:

- Row 9 should have 1s and 0s alternating starting from position 2.
- Column 2 should have 1s and 0s alternating starting from position 9.
- The number 5 should appear at specific positions where the pattern intersects or where it naturally fits into the alternating sequence.

82819916,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the pattern in how the grids transform from input to output. From the training examples, we can observe that:

1. For each row in the input grid, if there are non-zero values, these values get repeated across the entire row.
2. This repetition happens only for rows that have at least one non-zero element. Rows with all zeros remain unchanged.
3. The repeating pattern starts from the first non-zero value encountered in the row.

Given this pattern, let's apply it to the test case input grid:

be94b721,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1** shows the removal of all zeros except those necessary to preserve the shape of colored regions. The output is a smaller grid containing only the non-zero elements that form a contiguous block.
2. **Example 2** follows a similar pattern, where the entire region of 4s is isolated from zero padding and any other numbers.
3. **Example 3** and **Example 4** further confirm that the rule involves isolating and trimming colored regions to their minimal form, disregarding any surrounding zeroes.

Given these observations, the rule appears to involve cropping out the smallest rectangle containing all non-zero elements while maintaining their relative positions within the grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

The initial grid has several color blocks:
- A 4-block in the top left corner.
- A 3-block in the middle.
- A 5-block at the bottom left.
- A 6-block at the bottom right.

3. Numbers `2`, `3`, and `4` in the input seem to be affecting the positions around them by spreading their influence into neighboring cells but only when they're surrounded by certain conditions (like being next to a `5`).

Based on these observations, it appears that:
- Any `2`, `3`, or `4` not adjacent to a `5` gets erased (turned to `0`).
- When a `2`, `3`, or `4` is adjacent to a `5`, it causes a change in the pattern of `5`s, but only if it's not fully enclosed by `5`s.

2204b7a8,"To solve this puzzle, we need to observe the pattern in the transformation from the input to the output. Each example suggests that the transformation rule involves swapping the non-zero interior numbers with their corresponding edge numbers. For example, the number 3 within the grid gets replaced by the number 1 or 2 depending on which edge color it's closest to or surrounded by.

For the test case, the interior number 3 should be replaced by 5 or 4 according to its proximity to the leftmost (5) and rightmost (4) edges. 

Applying this rule:

- All internal 3s are replaced by the edge numbers (5 or 4) accordingly.
- The rest remain unchanged.

In analyzing the examples, I observe that the transformation rule involves inserting the number `1` in specific positions within the grid. The pattern appears to be placing a `1` in cells that are adjacent to the number `8`, specifically if there is a single cell between two `8`s or at the edge of a cluster of `8`s where it transitions back to `0`.

Let's apply these observations to the test case:

- We look for places where the number `1` should be inserted according to the observed pattern.
- In the test case, the transformations would occur in the vicinity of the clusters of `8`s.

Applying this to the test case grid, we can infer the following changes:

1. Identify and remove rows and columns containing only zeroes.

- In Example 2, the numbers 2, 3, 8 are transformed to 6, 4, 9 respectively.
- In Example 3, the numbers 5, 8, 6 are transformed to 1, 9, 2 respectively.
- In Example 4, the numbers 9, 4, 2 are transformed to 8, 3, 6 respectively.

From these examples, we can see no obvious arithmetic operations such as addition or subtraction that apply uniformly across all examples. Instead, the transformation seems to map certain numbers to specific other numbers.

Let's list out the mappings observed:
- 3 -> 4
- 1 -> 5
- 2 -> 6

- 3 -> 4
- 8 -> 9
- 5 -> 1
- 8 -> 9

These mappings suggest a specific pattern where each number appears to be mapped uniquely to another number. Given this pattern, let's determine the mapping for the numbers present in the test case:

- 8 -> 9
- 1 -> 5
- 3 -> 4

Therefore, the solution for the test case would involve replacing each 8 with a 9, each 1 with a 5, and each 3 with a 4.

In the examples provided:
- When there is a `2` in the input grid, it seems to trigger changes around it.
- The pattern of changes is that numbers `3`, `6`, `8`, and `7` appear around the location of `2`.

By analyzing the position of `2` and the resulting positions of these other numbers, we can infer the following:
- If `2` is located in the middle row and the last column, numbers `3`, `6`, `8`, and `7` appear in the top-right, bottom-right, and adjacent columns.
- If `2` is located in any other position, the placement of `3`, `6`, `8`, and `7` follows a similar pattern relative to the position of `2`.

Given the test case:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

We see that `2` is located at position `(1,4)`. Based on our observations and inferred rules, we expect:
- `3` to appear at position `(0,3)`
- `6` to appear at position `(0,4)`
- `8` to appear at position `(1,3)`
- `7` to appear at position `(1,4)`

In other words, if there's a non-zero value at a certain row-column index, the corresponding mirrored column (with respect to the center) also gets the same value.

Applying this logic to the test case:

1. Identify the non-zero values and their columns.
2. Mirror these non-zero values across the middle of the grid.

Let's apply this to our test case:

Columns with non-zero values are 1, 3, 4, and 5 out of total 10 columns. Mirrored columns would then be 9, 7, 6, and 5 respectively.

This spreading does not cross over other numbers. It essentially forms a block of the same color (number) around the initial occurrence of that number.

For the test case:
```plaintext
[
[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

- The `8` at position `[0][0]` will spread to all positions in its row and column until it meets the `8` at position `[1][2]`.
- The `8` at position `[1][2]` will also spread but will stop at the first `8` encountered.
- The `6` at position `[4][5]` will spread horizontally and vertically, but will not reach the `6` at position `[7][1]` because they are separated by zero-valued cells.

Thus, the transformed output would be:
```python

d10ecb37,"To solve this puzzle, we first need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the provided examples.

In all the given examples, the transformation reduces the input grid to a smaller 2x2 grid. The key appears to be selecting the top-left value and the one to its right from the first row, then selecting the top-left value and the one directly below from the second row, ignoring all other values.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[9, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 9],
[2, 9, 9, 6, 6, 9, 9, 2],
[6, 9, 9, 2, 2, 9, 9, 6],
[9, 2, 6, 9, 9, 6, 2, 9]
]
```

Following the identified rule:
- The first row gives us 9 and 6 (first two elements).
- The second row gives us 2 and 9 (first element and element directly below the first element).

Therefore, applying this rule to the test input, we get the following 2x2 grid:

In particular, the pattern seems to move the color 5 blocks up or down depending on their initial placement while leaving all other elements unchanged. For the color 5 blocks to be moved:

- If the block's center (the middle row and column of the block) is above the horizontal center of the grid (i.e., above row 7), then it moves up.
- If the block's center is below the horizontal center of the grid, the blocks move down.

2. The second column of the output is the same as the second column of the input.
3. The third column of the output is the same as the third column of the input.
4. For the columns containing zeros (columns 4 to 8), the output columns are filled with repeated sequences from the non-zero columns of the input grid. The sequence follows an order that mirrors the input's first three columns but reverses at the third column.
5. The last two columns of the output (columns 9 and 10) are derived from the first three columns of the input, following a specific reversal pattern.

The transformation seems to involve changing certain numbers in the input grid. Observing all the examples:

1. Numbers `1` and `8` seem to get transformed into `5`. However, not all instances of `1` or `8` are changed; it appears that these transformations happen only when they are surrounded by specific conditions or are isolated in some manner.
2. Once a `1` or `8` is changed to `5`, neighboring cells that connect with those transformed cells also change to `5`.
3. Cells that are connected horizontally or vertically but not diagonally seem to follow the rule if they meet the above criteria.

Based on the pattern seen from the previous examples:

- In Example 1, the central `1` and lower adjacent `8`s turned into `5`.
- In Example 2, similarly, the `8`s turned into `5`.
- In Example 3, the `8`s directly next to `2` got changed to `5`.
- In Example 4, both top and bottom rows became `5`.

Analyzing the test case:

```
[
[1, 3, 2],
[3, 3, 2],
[1, 3, 2]]
```

Since `1` and `8` transformation rules are clear and there are no `8`s here, we focus on `1`. 

In this test case, the `1`s at the corners do not influence each other because they are not directly connected. Thus, no transformation occurs according to the observed rules, since none of the `1`s are surrounded or influenced in a way that changes their state.

Therefore, the output remains the same:

Answer: ``` [[1, 3, 2], [3, 3, 2], [1, 3, 2]] ```","[[1 3 2]
 [3 3 2]
 [1 3 2]]",True,True,0.44
e9afcf9a,"Based on the provided examples, the transformation rule appears to alternate the numbers between the two rows in a checkerboard pattern.

In Example 1, the input has two rows with repeating numbers (3s and 9s), and the output alternates these numbers column-wise.

Similarly, in Example 2, the input has two rows with repeating numbers (4s and 8s), and the output alternates these numbers column-wise.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Test Input:
```
[
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]
```

The output would be:
```
[
[6, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2],
[2, 6, 2, 6, 2, 6]]
```

Answer: ``` [[6, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2], [2, 6, 2, 6, 2, 6]] ```","[[6 2 6 2 6 2]
 [2 6 2 6 2 6]]",True,True,1.0
ddf7fa4f,"To solve the test case, we need to apply the observed pattern from the training examples. The transformation seems to propagate the numbers in the top row to fill in certain patterns based on the existing color blocks. Let's break down how to apply this to the test case.

In the test case:
- The number `3` appears at the top left corner.
- The number `6` appears next to `3`.
- The number `9` appears to the right of `6`, but only in certain positions.
- There are large blocks of `5` that need to be transformed into other values according to their proximity to `3`, `6`, or `9`.

Following the transformation rules, we should replace the `5`s with the closest top-row values `3`, `6`, or `9`. Specifically, the `5`s in the middle column should become `6` because they are closer to the `6` than to `9`. The `5`s to the right of these should become `9` since they are closer to `9`.

Here is the solution:

# Calculate the middle index
middle_index = len(input_grid[0]) // 2

output_grid = []

for row in input_grid:
    mirrored_row = []
    for i in range(len(row)):
        if row[i] != 0:
            mirrored_position = (middle_index - (i - middle_index)) % len(row)
            if row[mirrored_position] == 0:

    for i in range(len(mirrored_row)):

    output_grid.append(mirrored_row)

print(""Answer: "", output_grid)
```

Note: The above approach is based on the interpretation of symmetry across the vertical axis, but there's a slight issue in the implementation logic for generating the mirrored row correctly. To simplify and ensure correctness, let's manually construct the mirrored rows:

```python
output_grid = []

for row in input_grid:
    mirrored_row = [row[-i-1] if row[-i-1] != 0 else row[i] for i in range(len(row))]
    output_grid.append(mirrored_row)

print(""Answer: "", output_grid)

b91ae062,"The transformation rule involves expanding each non-zero number in the input grid into a square block of the same number across the output grid. The size of the square block is determined by the dimensions of the original grid. For instance, if the input grid has a dimension of 3x3, then each non-zero number will expand into a 3x3 block of itself in the output grid.

Applying the rule to the test input:
