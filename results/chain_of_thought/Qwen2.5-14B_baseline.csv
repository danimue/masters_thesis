75b8110e,"The transformations seem to involve picking certain elements from the original grid and reorganizing them into a new structure. However, the specific rule for choosing which elements and how they're rearranged isn't immediately clear from just looking at the examples. To understand the rule, we should examine which elements in the original grid appear in the transformed grid.

Upon careful inspection of the examples, it appears that the transformation takes only the first occurrence of each distinct color in each row of the input grid and arranges those colors in columns corresponding to their positions in the rows. If the same color appears multiple times on one row before another color appears, only the first instance is used.

However, a closer look reveals that the rule is slightly different and simpler: it seems to take the elements from the extreme left and right of every row where there is a non-zero value, and then combines these elements vertically in the order of the original rows while maintaining their horizontal position.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
- First, find the leftmost and rightmost non-zero elements in each row.
- Then create the output grid based on these found elements.

Test Case Transformation:
- Row 1: Leftmost [4], Rightmost [5]
- Row 2: Leftmost [4], Rightmost [5]
- Row 3: Leftmost [4], Rightmost [5]
- Row 4: Rightmost [5] (Leftmost is zero)
- Row 5: Leftmost [6], Rightmost [9]
- Row 6: Rightmost [9] (Leftmost is zero)
- Row 7: Leftmost [6], Rightmost [9]
- Row 8: Leftmost [6], Rightmost [9]

So, organizing these into new rows:
```python
[
[4, 5],
[4, 5],
[4, 5],
[5, 0],
[6, 9],
[0, 9],
[6, 9],
[6, 9]]
```

Since we need to fill up all columns with available elements and ensure the output grid size is consistent with the examples provided, we can interpret '0' as not filling a column when there's no element from the current row:
```python
[
[4, 5],
[4, 5],
[4, 5],
[5, 5],
[6, 9],
[9, 9],
[6, 9],
[6, 9]]
```

We also need to check if the second column should be filled by the previous row's rightmost element if the current row has none, but the test case above seems to follow the rule of dropping zeros unless needed to fill dimensions.

Hence, final answer considering pattern matching from examples:
Answer: ```[[4, 5], [4, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5], [6, 9], [9, 9], [6, 9], [6, 9]]``` 

Given the pattern in the examples, we might simplify to the minimum required dimensions:
Answer: ```[[4, 5], [4, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5], [6, 9], [0, 9], [6, 9], [6, 9]]``` but more precisely, considering the minimal non-zero rule and example consistency:

It appears that for values 1 and 5, if they are inside the rectangle formed by the bottom row and the rightmost column, they get moved towards the edges of this rectangle, while maintaining their relative positions with other altered numbers.

For the test case provided, the rule would move the 1's and 5's in the middle of the grid down and to the sides of the bottom-right rectangle. Let's apply this rule:

3ac3eb23,"The transformation rule in these examples seems to involve duplicating the non-zero elements in each row across the subsequent rows. Specifically, for each non-zero element found at a certain column in the first row, the same value is placed in the second, fourth, sixth, etc., rows of the output grid, with zeros interspersed. 

In more detail:
- Non-zero values from the first row are replicated in every other row.
- Rows in between the first row and its replicated rows are filled with zeros.

Let's apply this rule to the given test case:

Given Test Case:
```python
[
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Applying the rule:
1. The first row contains non-zero elements at columns 3, 7, and 10, which have values 3, 6, and 7 respectively.
2. We replicate those in every other row with zeros in between.

Thus, the transformed output would look like:

67a423a3,"The transformation rule seems to involve changing the cells around certain patterns or numbers into specific other numbers. In particular, we can see that whenever there's a number that stands out in rows surrounded mainly by zeros, the cells surrounding this number get filled with a new value.

Let's look at the examples closely:

- Example 1: The cell containing 3 stays the same while its neighboring cells are filled with 4. 
- Example 2: The cells around the central 6, and the cells above and below that row containing 6 and surrounded by zeros, are filled with 4 and 8 respectively.
- Example 3: Similar to the first two examples, the cell containing 1 remains unchanged while the cells around it and the cells directly above and below the 1 surrounded by zeros get changed to 4 and 9 respectively.

In the test case, we have a series of rows that are mostly zero except for the middle column which contains 5. The surrounding cells of these 5s need to be transformed.

Following the pattern observed:

- For the rows that contain 5 in the middle and are surrounded by zeros, those zeros will be replaced by 4s.
- For the row where 5 is surrounded by threes, the threes stay the same but the zeros adjacent to them become 4s.
- Other rows and columns that do not affect the 5s remain unchanged.

- A block of 5s that spans the entire width of the grid gets transformed into a block of alternating 1s and 4s on top, followed by a block of alternating 4s and 2s below.
- Smaller blocks of 5s get transformed into shorter sequences according to the same alternating pattern.

e8593010,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze how the elements in the output correspond to the elements in the input for the provided training examples.

In each of the examples, the element `0` from the input grid was transformed into either `1`, `2`, or `3`. The transformation seems to depend on the surrounding elements, specifically the adjacent `5`s in a row-wise and column-wise direction (not necessarily diagonally).

For the test case:
- If the `0` is surrounded by `5`s on both sides horizontally (left and right), it becomes a `3`.
- If the `0` is surrounded by `5`s only on one side (either left or right but not both), it transforms into a `1`.
- If the `0` is surrounded by `5`s both above and below (up and down), it turns into a `2`.
- If the `0` has no `5`s directly above, below, left, or right (or if there are `5`s on diagonal positions), it remains unchanged (stays `0`).

Based on this analysis, here is the solution for the test case:

f76d97a5,"To determine the transformation rule from the given training examples, let's first analyze how the input grids are transformed into their respective output grids:

- In Example 1, the central color 5 in the input is replaced by 4 in the output, while the outer colors 4 become 0.
- In Example 2, the same pattern occurs. The central color (5) changes to 6, and the surrounding color (6) changes to 0.
- In Example 3, we see that the central color (9) transforms to 5 in the output, and the surrounding color (5) transforms to 0.

From these observations, it seems that the rule applied involves replacing a central color with another color and turning the surrounding colors into 0. The central color is defined as the one surrounded on all sides by the same color.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The central color here is 3, which is surrounded by 5 on its sides.
- The surrounding color (the one that surrounds the central color) is 5.

Accordingly, we'll replace all instances of 3 in positions that are surrounded by 5 with 0, and change all 5s to 3s if they are in those central positions.

The test case has a central color of 3 surrounded by 5s. Therefore, all 3s should become 0s and the 5s at the center (as per the definition above) should remain unchanged but be interpreted as new central ones:

9dfd6313,"To determine the transformation rule between the input and output grids, let's analyze the provided examples:

In Example 1:
- The input grid has a 5 in the first column, and the output moves that 5 to the first row.
- The input grid also has 5s down the diagonal. These 5s stay at the same positions in the output.

In Example 2:
- Similarly, the first 5 from the left in each row moves up one row in the output.
- The 5 in the last column stays in place.
- The diagonal pattern is preserved.

In Example 3:
- This pattern continues with the 5s moving up a row if they are not in the top row or last column, while diagonal 5s stay where they are.
- Additionally, the numbers adjacent horizontally and vertically to the 5s seem to move diagonally to maintain adjacency.

Based on these observations, we can infer the transformation rule: Each 5 moves up one row while maintaining its column position except for those already on the first row or in the last column, where they stay in place. Non-5 numbers will move to fill the space left by the 5s, moving diagonally to maintain their relative position within the grid.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],
[2, 0, 8, 8, 5, 0],
[2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]]
```

The 5 in the first row stays in place, the next two 5s move up one row, and the remaining 5 in the last row moves up one row, which results in a new row being added at the bottom of the grid filled with zeros.

Output:
```

4be741c5,"The transformation rule seems to be identifying unique consecutive sequences of numbers from top to bottom and left to right in the grid, and then listing those unique numbers vertically in the output.

In all provided examples, the output contains each unique color found in the input sequentially. In Example 1, there are three distinct groups of numbers (4, 2, and 8) from top to bottom, and each appears in its own column in the output. Similarly, in Example 2, the distinct numbers (2, 8, 5) are listed as separate columns in the output. Lastly, in Example 3, each distinct number (6, 4, 2, 3) is represented as separate vertical entries.

Given the test case, we have four different numbers (3, 2, 1, 8), which appear in that order from top to bottom and left to right. So the output should contain these distinct numbers as separate columns:

29c11459,"The transformation rule seems to involve filling in the zeros around any non-zero numbers with those non-zero numbers, spreading them out to the left and right until they meet another number or reach the end of the row. When two different numbers spread towards each other, they meet at a zero and that zero is replaced by a value that is in between the two based on the sequence of numbers (e.g., 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9). If they meet at a zero that is exactly between the two numbers, a 5 is used as the middle value.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

#### Transformations:
1. Identify the first occurrence of 1s, and separate them with 2s.
2. Subsequent rows with 1s follow an alternating pattern based on the previous row’s color sequence.

Let's apply these steps to the test input:
- First two rows are all zeros.
- In the third row:
  - Replace `1` sequences with alternating `1`s and `2`s starting from 1s.
  - `[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]` becomes `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0]`.
- Continue using the alternating pattern for subsequent rows:
  - Fourth row: `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]` becomes `[0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0]`.
  - Sixth row: `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]` becomes `[0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0]`.

995c5fa3,"To deduce the transformation rule from the given training examples, let's analyze the patterns:

- In Example 1, the original grid has two distinct columns of 0s and 5s. The output grid consists of three rows with a single color.
- In Example 2, the pattern changes slightly with additional zeros scattered around. Again, the output grid consists of three rows.
- In Example 3, we see an arrangement where the zeros are positioned differently, leading to another set of three distinct colors in the output grid.
- In Example 4, zeros are placed in different positions once more, but this time, they form different clusters leading to a somewhat repeated pattern of colors.

Given these observations, we can hypothesize that the rule involves condensing the information about the presence and positioning of zeros into fewer rows of different colors based on some pattern. For each column in the original grid, if there are any zeros present, the corresponding output color could be derived depending on where those zeros appear. 

Let's break down the test case:
- First row has no zeros.
- Second row has zeros at indices 5 and 6.
- Third row has zeros at indices 1, 2, 5, and 6.
- Fourth row has zeros at indices 1, 2 and 5.

Analyzing the position of zeros:
1. **First row**: No zeros -> color not influenced here.
2. **Second row**: Zeros at indices 5 and 6 -> possible color.
3. **Third row**: Zeros at indices 1, 2, 5, and 6 -> possible color.
4. **Fourth row**: Zeros at indices 1, 2, and 5 -> possible color.

Based on the previous examples, specific positions of zeros seem to correspond to specific colors in the output. We can derive:
- If zeros are present in the 5th index of any row -> color 2.
- If zeros are present in the 6th index of any row -> color 8.
- If zeros are present in both the 1st and 2nd indices of any row -> color 4.

Applying these rules to the test case:
- First row: All 5s -> This row doesn't affect the output because it has no zeros.
- Second row: Zeros at indices 5 and 6 -> This should influence color 8.
- Third row: Zeros at indices 1, 2, 5, and 6 -> This influences color 4.
- Fourth row: Zeros at indices 1, 2 and 5 -> This influences color 4.

Thus, the output for the test case should be:

### Analysis of Transformation
1. **Grid Dimensions**: Both the input and output grids have the same dimensions.
2. **Color Spreading**: It seems that the color '8' (or any other color present) spreads diagonally in all directions when present in the input grid.

Let's apply this to the test case:

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

### Transformations for Each '8'
- From position `[2][4]` (zero-based index), the '8' should spread to `[3][5]`, `[1][3]`, `[3][3]`, `[1][5]`.
- From positions `[3][3]` and `[3][4]`, they should spread to their diagonal neighbors.
- From positions `[4][7]` and `[4][8]`, they should spread to `[3][6]`, `[3][7]`, `[5][8]`, `[5][7]`.
- From position `[6][2]` and `[6][3]`, they should spread to `[5][1]`, `[5][2]`, `[7][4]`, `[7][3]`.
- Position `[7][3]` should spread to its diagonal neighbors `[6][2]`, `[6][4]`, `[8][4]`, `[8][2]`.

### Constructing the Output Grid
We can now construct the output grid by ensuring that all '8' values and their corresponding diagonal spreads are accounted for.

ce4f8723,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids, let's analyze the patterns from the provided examples:

- In all the examples, the top four rows of the input are transformed into the first four rows of the output.
- The value `4` in all examples seems to be replaced by `3`, except when directly followed or preceded by `2`.
- The value `2` in the input grid appears in certain positions in the fifth row and below, which seem to have no direct effect on the output in the first four rows.

Examining each cell in the top four rows of the test case, we see that cells containing `1` in the input become `3` in the output, unless they are next to a `2` in the input. Cells with `0` stay as `0` if not adjacent to a `2`.

Let's apply these rules to the top four rows of the test case:

af902bf9,"To solve the test case, we need to observe the pattern that transforms the input into the output based on the provided examples.

From the examples given:
- In Example 1, the output has only one row in the middle with 2s where there was originally a gap between two 4s.
- In Example 2, the output places 2s in the rows directly above and below the 4s when there's a straight line of 4s horizontally.
- In Example 3, we see both vertical lines (like in Example 2) and a horizontal line with the corresponding 2s placed around it.

The rule seems to be inserting a row or column of 2s directly above/below or to the left/right, respectively, whenever there are adjacent 4s vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally. This insertion happens in all the intervening rows/columns where there is no 4 until another 4 is encountered.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:

In the third example, we see the same behavior happening with the non-zero numbers being retained in order from the topmost occurrence down the columns.

Applying the same rule to the test case provided:

- For the first column, the non-zero value is at row 8 (counting from 0).
- For the second column, there are no non-zero values.

Therefore, the rule appears to be replacing ""1""s with the next number in the sequence from the initial set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} until all numbers in the sequence have been used cyclically.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- Replace every ""1"" following another ""1"" in the same row with ""8"".
- Replace every ""8"" following another ""8"" in the same row with ""1"".
- Replace every ""6"" following another ""6"" in the same row with ""1"".

c8cbb738,"To determine the transformation rule, let's observe the patterns in provided examples:

Example 1:
- Input grid is of size 12x11.
- Output grid is of size 5x5.
- The pattern seems to be taking the middle 5x5 block from the larger grid and transforming certain numbers.

Example 2:
- Input grid is of size 10x8.
- Output grid is of size 3x3.
- Again, it seems to be taking the middle 3x3 block and altering some numbers.

Example 3:
- Input grid is of size 16x19.
- Output grid is of size 5x5.
- The rule appears to involve the middle of the grid with specific number transformations.

From the patterns observed, it seems that the transformation involves selecting a central part of the grid and possibly converting certain numbers based on their positions or occurrences.

Let's apply the same logic to the test case:

Test Case:
- Input grid is of size 18x19.
- Since we have seen that the output grid size in all previous examples is 5x5, we can expect the same here.
- We take the middle 5x5 section of the grid, which would be rows 7-11 and columns 7-11.

Input Grid Middle Section (rows 7-11, columns 7-11):

[8, 8, 6, 8, 8]
]

Looking at the examples again, numbers 1, 2, and 6 appear to be converted to other numbers while keeping 8 as-is. Let's see if there's any consistent conversion:

In Example 1, 1->3, 4->2, 8->3.
In Example 2, 1->3, 8->8, 3->8.
In Example 3, 1->3, 2->4, 6->7, 8->4.

The conversions seem inconsistent between examples, so instead of specific number-to-number mappings, it might just be a matter of simplifying the grid by removing duplicates and focusing on distinct patterns or unique numbers.

For Test Case, the distinct numbers present are 1, 2, 6, and 8. Based on the examples, we can see that 1, 2, and 6 are often transformed:

Test Conversion:
- 1 -> 3,
- 2 -> 4,
- 6 -> 7,
- 8 remains 8.

44d8ac46,"Upon analyzing the provided training examples and their respective outputs, it appears that the rule transforms certain cells surrounded by the color '5' on all sides (except potentially the edges, which are always '0') into the color '2'. This can be observed in each example where the presence of a '5' block around an empty space ('0') leads to that '0' being replaced with a '2'.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

1. Locate any central '0' cells that have '5' cells on all of its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors.
2. Replace those '0' cells with '2' according to the identified pattern.

1b2d62fb,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the corresponding output grids.

By examining all five training examples, a pattern emerges where specific cells in the output grid contain the number 8 instead of 9 from the input grid, while all other cells remain 0. The placement of the 8s seems to be related to the cells containing the number 1 in the input grid.

The rule appears to be:
- For every cell that contains a 1 in the input grid, the output grid will have an 8 placed directly above the cell (if possible).
- If there's a 9 directly above the cell with 1, that 9 turns into an 8.
- Other cells containing 9s turn into 0s.
- Cells not in this relationship with 1 remain unchanged at 0, except if they're part of the row just above a row that has a cell with 1, then they can also change to 8.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```
[
 [9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0],
 [0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 [9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0],
 [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 0, 9],
 [0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 9, 9]]
```

First, find all cells containing a 1:
- The first row contains a 1 in column index 3.
- The second row contains a 1 in column index 3.
- The third row contains a 1 in column index 3.
- The fourth row contains a 1 in column index 3.
- The fifth row contains a 1 in column index 3.

Now place 8s directly above these 1s:
- Directly above the first 1 in the first row, there is no cell available.
- Directly above the second 1, place an 8 in the first row at index 3.
- Directly above the third 1, place an 8 in the second row at index 3.
- Directly above the fourth 1, place an 8 in the third row at index 3.
- Directly above the fifth 1, place an 8 in the fourth row at index 3.

After placing these 8s, the rest of the 9s should be changed to 0s, and other cells remain as they are.

Test Case Output:
```
[
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],

09629e4f,"The transformation rule in these examples seems to involve replicating certain colors vertically around rows filled entirely with the number 5, creating a ""shadow"" or reflection effect above and below those rows. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the row that consists entirely of the number 5.
2. Replicate the numbers directly above the identified row down to the top.
3. Replicate the numbers directly below the identified row up to the bottom.

In the given test case, the fourth row consists entirely of the number 5. We then replicate the pattern from the third row to the top and the fifth row to the bottom accordingly.

Let's apply the rule to the test case:

Applying the rule:
- Replace all 3s with 8s.
- The number 2 in the first element of the input stays 2.
- The number 3 in the second row, sixth column becomes 8.
- The number 3 in the third row, second column becomes 8.
- The number 3 in the sixth row, eighth column becomes 8.

- In the second example, the leftmost column and rightmost column have 0s adjacent to the full rows of 5s getting different numbers.
- In the third example, we see a combination of rows and columns filled with 5s affecting the adjacent 0s.

Following this pattern, the test case has a central row and column of all 5s. Cells adjacent to the left and right of this middle row of 5s should transform to 2, while cells below the top row and above the bottom row of 5s should transform similarly.

d6ad076f,"The transformation rule applied in these examples seems to involve changing the color of the middle part of any solid block of color surrounded on both sides by different colors or the edge of the grid. In the first example, a block of '2's at the center has been replaced by '8's. Similarly, in the second example, a vertical strip of '4's was transformed into '8's where they met with '6's. In the third example, the central horizontal strip of '3's has changed into '8', intersecting the vertical strip of '9's.

Following this rule, for the test case provided, we see a solid block of '1's forming a square towards the left and a smaller block of '2's to the right of it. The '1's extend beyond the '2's, so the area where they meet would not be transformed. However, the middle of the '1' block, not touching the '2' block, remains unchanged.

b0c4d837,"Let's analyze the pattern from the examples provided:

- In Example 1, all the 5s and 8s are transformed into just 8s in the top row of the 3x3 output.
- In Example 2, similar to Example 1, but now there are some 5s surrounding the 8s, which do not contribute to the final output.
- In Example 3, only the middle column has an 8, and it is the only color represented in the top row of the output.
- In Example 4, we have 5s and 8s, but the pattern shifts such that the second column gets an 8, while the first gets a 0.
- In Example 5, the 8s are present in the third and fourth columns. However, only the third column of the input is represented in the output.
- In Example 6, again the 8s are present in the third and fourth columns, but only the third column of the input is represented in the output.

From these examples, it seems the transformation rule focuses on the presence of the highest number (8 in these cases) in specific positions and translates those positions into the corresponding output grid. Additionally, if no 8 is present, then the 5 that appears in the last row of the original grid determines a single non-zero value in the output grid.

Now let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test case: The input contains 8s in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth columns. The transformation will only capture the leftmost occurrence of the highest number (8), which is in the third column.

- Replace all zeros (0) with themselves (no change).
- For each occurrence of 2 from its position onward in the same row, replace it with 8.

This results in the grid being extended to twice its height and width, with its center being the original grid.

For the test case:

Input:
```

```

The grid is first flipped horizontally (mirrored along the vertical axis) and vertically (mirrored along the horizontal axis), and then the original grid is placed in the middle of these two mirrored versions. Here's how it would look:

Original Grid:

```

Vertical Flip:
```
[
[9, 9, 4, 4],

447fd412,"Answering this question requires identifying the pattern that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the provided examples. In all cases, it appears that the transformation rule involves spreading out certain color codes from their original positions in specific directions. 

Let's analyze the transformation process:

- In the first example, the color ""1"" spreads upwards from its initial position and the color ""2"" spreads downwards.
- In the second example, the color ""1"" spreads rightwards and leftwards from its original position.
- In the third example, we see that colors ""1"" and ""2"" spread out in multiple directions.

The general pattern seems to be that a color code expands in all possible directions (up, down, right, left) until another color code or the boundary of the grid stops it.

Based on this understanding, let's apply the transformation to the test case:

1. The color ""1"" at (2,2) spreads up, down, left, and right. 
2. The color ""2"" at (2,4) and (8,17) also spreads in similar patterns but only to the extent they are not blocked by other colors. 

Let's create the output grid according to these rules.

0ca9ddb6,"To determine the rule applied in transforming the inputs into the outputs, let's analyze the pattern.

Firstly, observe that all zeroes remain unchanged, suggesting that they are not affected by the transformation.

Secondly, for non-zero elements:
- In Example 1, the '2' in position (3,3) was used to fill the surrounding positions with '4', and the '1' in position (6,7) was used to fill its surrounding positions with '7'.
- In Example 2, the '8' in position (1,4), '2' in positions (3,7) and (7,1), and '1' in position (4,3) are used to fill their surrounding positions.
- In Example 3, the '2' in position (3,3), '6' in position (6,7), and '1' in position (8,4) behave similarly.

From these observations, we can deduce that the rule fills the adjacent positions (up, down, left, right) with a specific value. For a given non-zero number, the corresponding number to fill in the adjacent positions seems to be a particular shift or calculation of the original number. Let's determine the pattern more clearly:

- '1' transforms into '7' in adjacent cells.
- '2' transforms into '4' in adjacent cells.
- '6' transforms into '7' in adjacent cells.
- '8' transforms into '4' in adjacent cells.

This suggests that '1' and '6' map to '7', while '2' and '8' map to '4'. Now let's apply this rule to the test case.

Test Case:
- There is a '1' at position (3,7).
- There is a '2' at position (4,3).
- There is an '8' at position (6,6).
- There is a '6' at position (6,8).

Applying the rule:
- Fill positions around '1' (3,7) with '7'.
- Fill positions around '2' (4,3) with '4'.
- Fill positions around '8' (6,6) with '4'.
- Fill positions around '6' (6,8) with '7'.

The resulting transformed grid would look like this:

7447852a,"The pattern observed in these transformations involves adding a layer of color around existing color patterns (where color '2' exists), filling in the gaps of adjacent zeros with '4', while keeping the original '2's unchanged. Given that the input and output shapes match exactly and there are no changes to the structure other than the addition of '4's around '2's, we can deduce that the rule is to fill in all zeros that neighbor the '2's directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally with '4'.

Let's apply the same rule to the test case provided:

Input:
```python
[
[2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2],

```

Following the rule described:

1. For the first row, fill zeros next to '2's.
   - Positions: (0, 0) -> (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 12), (0, 16), (0, 20)
     This means fill positions (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), and so on with '4'.
2. Do the same for the second row.
3. Do the same for the third row.

Resulting output:
```python
[
[2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2],

3906de3d,"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the transformation rule from the provided examples:

- In Example 1, the color '2' in the seventh row was introduced to the fourth row where the previous color was '0'.
- In Example 2, the color '2' from the seventh row was also introduced to the third and fourth rows.
- In Example 3, the color '2' was spread outwards from its initial location in a similar manner.

From these examples, we can infer that the transformation rule involves spreading the color '2' upwards into the first contiguous block of '1' colors above its location. When there's a gap (color '0'), the '2' spreads to fill that gap in the row above if there are '1's on both sides of the gap in that row.

Applying this rule to the test case:

The color '2' starts in the fifth row and is surrounded by '0's in the rows above until we reach the fourth row where we see a pattern of '1's and '0's. Applying the rule described, the '2' should spread to the fourth row at positions where there's a gap ('0') and '1's on both sides. This means that in the fourth row, the zeros that are between ones will be replaced with twos.

Therefore, the transformed grid based on the analysis would look like:

c8f0f002,"To determine the transformation rule from the training examples, let's compare the inputs and outputs:

1. In Example 1, the numbers 7 that had another 7 directly next to them (either horizontally or vertically) were replaced with 5.
2. In Example 2, the pattern is the same. Each 7 that was adjacent to another 7, even diagonally, was transformed into 5.
3. Example 3 follows the same rule, where 7s that have other 7s as direct neighbors get changed to 5.

The common transformation rule appears to be:

- Replace every occurrence of the number 7 with 5 if it has an adjacent 7 (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

Now, apply this rule to the Test case:

1. The first row contains [1, 7, 7, 1, 7]. The two central 7s are adjacent to each other, so they both need to be replaced with 5. This gives us [1, 5, 5, 1, 7].
2. The second row contains [8, 1, 7, 7, 7]. Here, the three 7s in a sequence are adjacent to each other, so all should become 5. Thus, we get [8, 1, 5, 5, 5].
3. The third row contains [8, 7, 1, 7, 8]. The third and fourth 7s are adjacent, so these should also be replaced by 5. We get [8, 5, 1, 5, 8].

Therefore, the transformed Test case is:

- Zeroes next to a '5' from the right are replaced with '6'.
- Zeroes next to a '5' from the left are replaced with '7'.
- Zeroes between two '5's are replaced with '8'.

Number 2 (topmost) starts spreading horizontally and then down, filling the gaps until it reaches the edge or encounters the number 8. Meanwhile, the number 8s (bottommost) start spreading upwards and to the left, filling the gaps accordingly. 

So our output would look like this:

fafffa47,"To determine the transformation rule being applied:

Firstly, notice that in all examples, the output is a grid of smaller size compared to the input - specifically, we drop rows with no 9s and columns with no 9s. Then, 9s in the input become 0s in the output, and there seems to be a pattern where cells surrounded by 9s on both sides horizontally or vertically become 2s in specific configurations.

Let's apply these rules to the test case:
- Remove any row or column entirely composed of zeros.
- Where original 9s appear after such removal, replace those 9s with 0s.
- For remaining cells that were originally surrounded by 9s on both sides horizontally or vertically (after removing non-relevant rows/columns), change them to 2s.

Let's do this step-by-step for the test case:

1. Original Test Case Grid:
    [
    [9, 0, 9],
    [0, 0, 9],
    [9, 0, 9],
    [0, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 0]]
    
2. Removing rows with only 0s:
    [
    [9, 0, 9],
    [0, 0, 9],
    [9, 0, 9]]

3. Removing columns with only 0s:
    [
    [9, 9],
    [0, 9],
    [9, 9]]

4. Replace 9s with 0s and look for cells surrounded by 9s:
    [
    [0, 0],
    [0, 0],
    [0, 0]]
    
However, in this case, there aren't any cells that meet the criteria of being surrounded by 9s on both sides horizontally or vertically after the removal of 0-only rows and columns. Therefore, the transformation results in a grid of zeros.

a65b410d,"To determine the rule applied to the inputs to get the outputs, let's analyze the patterns in the examples:

1. In all the examples, we see that non-zero values are spreading upwards from their initial position.
2. Each value spreads up one row at a time and decreases by one color level (from 2 to 1 and then to 0).
3. After reaching 0, the cell remains 0 and no further propagation happens.

Based on these observations, here's how I'll apply the rule to the Test Case:

- Initial input has a row with five consecutive `2`s starting at index 2:
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  
- The row with `2`s propagates one row above, decreasing to `1`:
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

- The row with `1`s propagates two rows above, decreasing to `0`, and the original `2`s propagate one row above, decreasing to `1`:
  [
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

- This pattern continues until the top row is reached:
  [
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

- The row with `4`s becomes the new top row:
  [
  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

- Continuing the process, we can infer that after propagation completes, the top row will have `5`s, the second row `4`s, and so on:

5117e062,"To figure out the transformation rule from the given examples, I'll analyze how the inputs transform into outputs in each of the provided cases.

From Example 1:
- Input has the most frequent color (4) on the right side.
- Output has only the color 4 and forms a specific pattern with it.

From Example 2:
- Input has the most frequent color (2) on the right side.
- Output has only the color 2 and forms a specific pattern with it.

From Example 3:
- Input has the most frequent color (1) in the middle.
- Output has only the color 1 and forms a specific pattern with it.

It seems that the transformation rule involves keeping only the most frequently occurring color in the input grid and arranging it in a specific way in the output. For output arrangement, we can see that the non-zero color appears in a triangular pattern starting from one end, typically the left or the top-left depending on where the maximum frequency color appears.

For the Test case:
The most frequent color is 0 (which is the background), but if we look for the next most frequent, we see that color 1 does not appear, color 2 appears 2 times and color 3 appears 3 times, and color 7 appears 4 times. So, the most frequently appearing color is 7.

The color 7 appears in the 5th, 6th, and 10th rows of the Test case input. It appears twice in row 5, once in row 6, and four times in row 10. Based on the examples, we form an output that matches the frequency pattern of the most common color (7 in this case):

```
[
[0, 0, 7, 0, 0],
[0, 7, 0, 7, 0],
[7, 0, 0, 0, 7],
[0, 7, 0, 7, 0],
[0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
]
```

However, since the example outputs show a more compact triangular shape, it makes sense to simplify based on the largest contiguous appearance of the color 7 which is in row 10. Thus, the output should reflect the simplified pattern based on color 7:

```
[
[0, 0, 7, 0, 0],
[0, 7, 0, 7, 0],
[7, 7, 7, 7, 7],
[0, 7, 0, 7, 0],
[0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
]
```

But the simplest and most fitting pattern among the examples is a triangle formed by repeating the most frequent color (7) in a symmetric manner from the center outwards:

```
[
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 7, 7],
[7, 7, 7]
]
```

Therefore, the solution to the Test case is:

Answer: ```[[0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7]]```","[[0 0 0]

ba26e723,"The pattern observed in these examples suggests that the transformation involves substituting some zeros with the number 6. Specifically, it seems zeros are replaced with 6 if they are followed or preceded by a 4 along the rows. Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
 [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0],
 [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
 [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4]
]
```

Applying the rule to each row:

- For the first row `[0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0]`, we replace every 0 that is adjacent to 4 with 6. Thus, the sequence would become `[6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 0]`.

- For the second row `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`, there are no zeros, so it remains the same.

- For the third row `[4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4]`, we replace every 0 that is adjacent to 4 with 6. Thus, the sequence would become `[4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4]`.

25d8a9c8,"The pattern observed in the transformations is that any row or column which contains a specific number (4 in the first two examples) gets replaced with a single different number (5 in the first two examples) throughout the entire row or column in the output. In the provided examples, the key number seems to be 4, which when present in any part of a row or column, causes the entire row or column to transform into 5. However, in the third and fourth examples, the key number changes to 9 and then to 2, resulting in the transformation into 5 for rows/columns containing these numbers respectively.

For the test case, we see the number 4 in the first row and 8 in the last row. According to the rule, rows containing 4 and 8 are transformed to rows of 5 and 5 respectively. But since the rule only mentions a single key number per transformation and there's no mention of columns being affected independently based on different numbers (only full row or column transformation), we can assume the most conservative interpretation: any row containing any key number (previously seen keys are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9) transforms entirely to 5.

Therefore:
- The first row contains 4, so it should be transformed to [5, 5, 5].
- The second row doesn't contain 4, 8, 2, 3, 6, or 9, so it remains [0, 0, 0] (presumably representing a neutral or default state).
- The third row contains 8, so it should be transformed to [5, 5, 5].

623ea044,"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the provided examples step by step.

In Example 1, we have a single 2 in the middle of the input grid, transformed into a grid where the color 2 appears in a symmetrical pattern radiating outward from that initial position.

In Example 2, a 7 appears once in the input grid. In the output grid, it's replicated symmetrically around the center of the grid, with the number 7 appearing at equal distances from the center along all four directions.

In Example 3, a 6 appears in the middle of the 8th row. The transformation creates a symmetrical pattern with the number 6 spread out symmetrically from its initial position across the grid.

Given these patterns, the general rule seems to be:

- Identify the non-zero value(s) in the input grid.
- Distribute those value(s) symmetrically around the grid while maintaining their relative positions from the center of the grid.
- If there is no non-zero value in the grid or more than one value, they are distributed accordingly, maintaining symmetry.

Let's apply this rule to the Test Case. There is a single non-zero value, which is a 6, located in the middle of the 8th row. Hence, we will create a new grid where the 6 is replicated symmetrically from this point.

The final output grid for the Test Case would look like this:

We examine each occurrence of 6 and check if it is surrounded by zeros on all its adjacent cells. In the first row, there is no change since 6 is not surrounded by zeros on all sides. The second row has a 6 at position (1,0) which is surrounded by zeros on the left and above but not below; hence, it remains unchanged. But then we see a 6 at (1,5) which is only surrounded by zeros on the right and below, so it does not get doubled either.

We continue this process:
- (2,1) has 6 surrounded by zeros on the left, top, and bottom, so it becomes 12.
- (3,2), (3,7), (5,6), (6,5), (8,0), (8,9), (9,1), (10,3), (11,4) and (11,9) all have 6s surrounded by zeros on all sides except one or two, so they remain 6.

5c0a986e,"Analyzing the provided training examples, it appears that the transformation rule involves spreading out non-zero (color) blocks from their original positions towards the edges of the grid in a clockwise manner starting from the top-left corner.

In Example 1, the block of '1's spreads out into the first row, then the first column, then the bottom-right corner of the second row. The block of '2's stays intact until the last row where it spreads out into the right edge.
In Example 2, the block of '2's spreads out into the first two columns and the first row. Then, the block of '1's spreads out into the bottom-right corner.
In Example 3, the block of '2's is spread out into the first half of the bottom rows and the last half of the right column, while the block of '1's spreads out into the left column and upwards into the top rows.

Following this pattern for the test case:

- The '1's at positions (3,6) and (4,6) should spread out into the top and left direction.
- The '2's at positions (5,6) and (5,7) should spread out into the bottom and right direction.

f25fbde4,"The pattern observed in the transformations of the input grids into their respective outputs suggests that the transformation rule involves expanding any contiguous blocks of color '4' horizontally and vertically to fill all neighboring empty positions (i.e., '0's) until reaching another non-zero value or the edge of the grid. 

To apply the same rule to the test case:

- In the second row, there are two '4's separated by '0's. Each '4' expands horizontally to fill its adjacent cells.
- In the third row, there are three '4's in a column. This entire column expands vertically.
- The fourth row then has two '4's which also expand horizontally.

From these examples, we can detect a pattern:
- The output grid has a height that is at least twice the height of the input grid.
- If the input grid contains any color, that color appears in the first row of the output grid. 
- The rest of the rows in the output grid are filled with the largest color value found in the input grid (4 in Example 2, 8 in Example 3 and Test case, and 3 in Example 4).
- As we go down the rows in the output grid, zeros (0) are inserted progressively after the initial color sequence until only zeros remain.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
Test Case:
Input:
```
[
[8, 8, 2, 2],
[1, 8, 8, 2],
[1, 3, 3, 4],
[1, 1, 1, 1]]
```

The largest number in this grid is 8. We'll start with that largest number (8) and follow the rule:

First row should contain the numbers in order as they appear horizontally from left to right in the first row of the input.
Subsequent rows will have zeros progressively inserted after the sequence starting with 8.

So the output should look something like this:

ec883f72,"Based on the provided training examples, it seems that the transformation rule involves moving the non-zero values from the bottom right corner upwards and to the left. Additionally, if there are any non-zero values at the bottom-most rows which are not part of the pattern already moved up, they get rearranged in a similar manner, filling up the columns from the right side towards the left.

Applying this rule to the Test case:

The non-zero numbers (3 and 4) are located near the bottom-right corner, so we move those upwards and to the left. The 3's starting position is in the 5th row from the bottom and 9th column from the right, and the 4's are in the 7th column from the right and 6th and 7th rows from the bottom. As we move these numbers up and left, we fill until we reach the top of the matrix or a similar value is encountered.

Upon closer inspection, the '1's are converted into '2's if they form a continuous block in a row or column. In both examples, '1's that are isolated or don't form a continuous block remain unchanged.

Applying the observed rule to the test case:

- First row has an isolated '1' and doesn't form a continuous block.
- Second row has a continuous block of three '1's and should all transform to '2'.
- Third row has a continuous block of three '1's and should all transform to '2'.
- Fourth row has an isolated '1' and doesn't form a continuous block.
- Fifth row has a continuous block of three '1's and should all transform to '2'.
- Sixth row has no '1's.
- Seventh row has an isolated '1' and doesn't form a continuous block.
- Eighth row has a continuous block of three '1's and should all transform to '2'.
- Ninth row has a continuous block of four '1's including diagonals, only vertical and horizontal blocks need to be identified so only vertical transforms here.
- Tenth row has a continuous block of three '1's and should all transform to '2'.

d22278a0,"After analyzing the provided examples, it seems that the transformation rule involves filling zeros with the numbers from the input row in an extended pattern:

- Starting from each non-zero number in a row, fill the following zeros in an alternating sequence of that number and the next non-zero number in the row until you reach the end of the row or another non-zero number.
- If there's no next number in the sequence (i.e., if the row ends), continue using the last non-zero number encountered.
- In the case where there are consecutive non-zero numbers without any zeros between them, treat them as separate sequences of alternation.

Given the test case, the non-zero numbers in the first row are `4` and `8`. We begin by extending the zeros with an alternating pattern of `4` and `8`, and then handle the final `1` in the last row separately, creating a similar alternation as we go upwards.

Specifically, if a cell has a value that appears adjacent to another value (horizontally or vertically) in the next row or column, it might replace the current value with the adjacent one.

Let's apply this understanding to the test case:

Input:
```
[
 [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7],
 [3, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Following the identified pattern:
- The number `6` in the first row at position `[0][3]` and `[0][9]` is replaced by `2` since it is adjacent to `2` in the next row.
- The number `9` in the fourth row at position `[3][0]` is replaced by `8` as it is adjacent to `8` both vertically and horizontally.
- The number `7` in the fifth row at position `[4][9]` is replaced by `8`.
- The number `3` in the sixth row at position `[5][0]` is replaced by `8`.
- The number `4` in the seventh row at position `[6][0]` is replaced by `8`.
- The number `6` in the tenth row at position `[9][3]` remains unchanged as it is not adjacent to any other numbers which would trigger a change according to the observed rules.

Thus, the transformed output should be:
```

ae4f1146,"The pattern in these transformations seems to involve taking certain elements from the input grid to form the output grid. Specifically, it looks like the output grid is made up of the first non-zero elements from the first three rows (which are read left-to-right), and then the pattern continues with the last non-zero element from each of those rows (also read right-to-left).

From the training examples, we can see that:

- Example 1: The output grid takes the first three values from the first row and the last three values from the third row.
- Example 2: Similar approach is used, selecting the first and last three elements from specific rows.
- Example 3: Another pattern of selecting the first and last three elements from the specified rows.
- Example 4: Selects first three elements from the first row and the last three from the third row.

Given the test case, let's apply the same logic:
Input:
```
[
[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8],
[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 1],
[1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8]]
```

Output should take the first three elements and the last three elements from the first three rows:
```
[8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8]
[8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 1]
[1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8]
```
Reducing it to a 3x3 grid as seen in the examples:
``` 
[
[8, 8, 8],
[1, 8, 1],
[8, 1, 8]
]
```
But reviewing, it appears we need to select only the first three and last three unique elements from those rows, not all six together, and reshape it accordingly:

So the correct selection would be:
- First three: [8, 8, 8] from the first row.
- Last three: [8, 1, 8] from the third row.

Thus:

a68b268e,"To figure out the transformation rule applied to these grids, let's closely examine the inputs and outputs provided:

### Observations:
- **Color Clusters:** Each output grid seems to capture color clusters from the input grid.
- **Grid Size:** The width of the grids is reduced. The original grid is 9x9 while the output grid is 4x4.
- **Cluster Focus:** The output focuses on the intersection of color clusters in a specific pattern.

### Rule Analysis:
The transformation appears to take the top-right quadrant of each 3x3 block in the original grid, starting from the 1st row and column for the first element, and continuing in steps of 3 rows and columns.

### Steps Explained:
1. Split the original 9x9 grid into nine 3x3 blocks.
2. For each 3x3 block, extract the top-right corner value (which is at position [0][2] within the 3x3 block).
3. Collect these values to form a new 4x4 grid where each block's top-right corner value corresponds to an element in the new grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
Let's apply this rule to the provided test case.

1. Identify the 3x3 blocks:
   - Block 1: [
       [7, 7, 7],
       [7, 7, 0],
       [7, 0, 0]
     ]
   - Block 2: [
       [0, 1, 0],
       [1, 1, 4],
       [1, 1, 0]
     ]
   - Block 3: [
       [0, 0, 4],
       [0, 1, 4],
       [0, 1, 4]
     ]
   - Block 4: [
       [4, 0, 4],
       [4, 1, 0],
       [4, 0, 0]
     ]
   - Block 5: [
       [0, 1, 0],
       [0, 1, 6],
       [6, 1, 6]
     ]
   - Block 6: [
       [0, 0, 6],
       [0, 1, 0],
       [6, 1, 6]
     ]
   - Block 7: [
       [6, 0, 6],
       [6, 1, 6],
       [0, 1, 0]
     ]
   - Block 8: [
       [0, 0, 0],
       [0, 1, 0],
       [6, 1, 6]
     ]
   - Block 9: [
       [0, 6, 0],
       [6, 1, 6],
       [0, 0, 0]
     ]

2. Extract the top-right corner values:
   - From Block 1: 7
   - From Block 2: 0
   - From Block 3: 4
   - From Block 4: 4
   - From Block 5: 0
   - From Block 6: 6
   - From Block 7: 6
   - From Block 8: 0
   - From Block 9: 0

3. Form the 4x4 grid:
   - Row 1: [7, 0, 4, 4]
   - Row 2: [0, 0, 6, 6]
   - Row 3: [4, 6, 6, 0]
   - Row 4: [4, 6, 0, 0]

85c4e7cd,"Based on the provided examples, it appears the transformation rule for the grid involves replacing the numbers in such a way that there's a cyclic shift of the color values with one additional step: the outermost layer gets replaced by the number that would come after ""8"" in a typical numerical sequence (considering ""8"" as the highest value in the set), which seems to be ""0"", but in these cases, it's represented by the next logical number in the pattern, i.e., ""3"".

The rule applied here is:
- Each cell's value is replaced by the next higher value in the sequence, where ""8"" maps to ""3"", ""7"" maps to ""6"", ""6"" maps to ""5"", ""5"" maps to ""4"", ""4"" maps to ""2"", and ""2"" maps to ""1"".
- ""1"" maps back to ""8"" since it's the lowest value in the set and the replacement wraps around.
- The boundary cells are consistently shifted to the next highest value from ""8"" to ""3"".

Let's apply this rule to the Test Case:

Input:
```

[8, 2, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 2, 8],
[8, 2, 4, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 4, 2, 8],
[8, 2, 4, 3, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 3, 4, 2, 8],
[8, 2, 4, 3, 7, 6, 5, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 2, 8],
[8, 2, 4, 3, 7, 6, 5, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 2, 8],
[8, 2, 4, 3, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 3, 4, 2, 8],

[8, 2, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 2, 8],
[8, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 8],
[8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
]
```

By transforming ""8"" into ""3"", ""7"" into ""6"", ""6"" into ""5"", ""5"" into ""4"", ""4"" into ""2"", and ""2"" into ""1"":
- Replace all ""8""s with ""3"".
- Replace all ""7""s with ""6"".
- Replace all ""6""s with ""5"".
- Replace all ""5""s with ""4"".
- Replace all ""4""s with ""2"".
- Replace all ""2""s with ""1"".

The transformed grid will look like this:

d06dbe63,"From the given training examples, we can observe that the transformation rule involves spreading out the color (non-zero value) from its initial position in such a way that the entire row and column where the non-zero value occurs gets filled with a specific pattern (usually the number 5 or remains unchanged if it's 8).

In Example 1, the color 8 in the 4th row and 5th column causes all the cells in that row and column (except for the one with 8, which stays 8) to be replaced by 5.

In Example 2, the color 8 in the 8th row and 7th column causes all cells in that row and column (except the cell with 8) to be replaced by 5, and also affects a triangular region of cells around it.

Applying this rule to the test case, the color 8 in the 6th row and 6th column should fill the entire row and column (except the cell with 8) with 5, and affect a triangular region around it.

ea786f4a,"The transformation rule applied in each of the provided examples seems to be changing the color of the surrounding cells around the single central different cell to 0, while keeping the border cells and other non-surrounding cells unchanged. Here's how this rule works for each example:

- In Example 1, the single 0 in the center grid surrounded by 1s is transformed into a cross pattern with 0s, and the rest remains 1s.
- In Example 2, the single 0 cell is surrounded by 2s, so the cells touching it on all sides (horizontally and vertically) become 0s. The rest of the cells remain 2s.
- In Example 3, the same principle applies to a larger grid where the 0 at the center is surrounded by 3s, and the cells one step away from the 0 become 0s.

For the test case, we have a 11x11 grid filled with 6s except for a single 0 in the center. Applying the rule, the cells directly surrounding the central 0 should change to 0s.

The central position (0) is at index [5][5] in the grid.

a78176bb,"The rule being applied in these transformations is that a color number in the input grid moves diagonally down to the right until it hits the edge of the grid. If there is an empty cell in its path, the color number moves into that cell.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- Start with the input grid:
```python
[
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Move the numbers according to the rule:
- The '1' at position (0,1) moves to positions (1,2), (2,3), (3,4).
- The '1' at position (1,2) moves to (2,3), (3,4).
- The '1' at position (2,3) moves to (3,4).
- The '5' at position (1,3) moves to (2,4), (3,5), (4,6), (5,7), (6,8), (7,9).
- The '5' at position (1,4) moves to (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,8).
- And so on...

ed36ccf7,"The transformation rule seems to involve swapping certain elements in the grid. Observing the given examples, we can deduce that:

- In Example 1, the first row's elements have been swapped with those of the second column.
- In Example 2, the first row's elements have been swapped with those of the third column.
- In Example 3, the first row's elements have been swapped with those of the last row but only for the first two columns.
- In Example 4, the first row's elements have been swapped with those of the third row.

For the test case, following the pattern observed, we swap the first row's elements with those of the third row:

Original Test:
```

Applying the transformation rule:
- First cell of the first row (0) swaps with the first cell of the third row (0).
- Second cell of the first row (0) swaps with the second cell of the third row (5).
- Third cell of the first row (0) swaps with the third cell of the third row (5).

b230c067,"The provided examples seem to follow a pattern where all `8`s in the input are transformed into either `1`s or `2`s in the output, based on their positioning within the grid. Observing the outputs closely, we can deduce that:

- If an `8` is surrounded only in one direction (say top, bottom, left, right) by other `8`s, it gets transformed into `1`.
- If an `8` is surrounded in two directions (i.e., in a block or line formation), it gets transformed into `2`.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The `8` in positions (1,1) and (1,2) are part of a horizontal block with other `8`s, so they become `2`.
- Similarly, the `8` at position (1,7) transforms into `2`.
- Other isolated `8`s transform into `1`.

Applying the transformation:
- Each number moves from its current position to the position one cell diagonally up-left and down-right.
- If a number moves into a zero, it replaces that zero with the original number.

- In Example 1, any '0' in the input grid does not affect the grid except for spreading downwards.
- In Example 2, the color '3' spreads diagonally downwards from its position.
- In Example 3, the color '8' spreads to the right from its position and '4' remains unchanged.

From these observations, we understand the following transformations:
1. '0' spreads downward.
2. '3' spreads diagonally downwards.
3. Other colors remain unaffected.

In the test case, '0' and '3' appear, and they follow similar rules as seen in the previous examples. Therefore, when we apply these rules to the test case, the '0's spread downwards and the '3's spread diagonally downwards.

3428a4f5,"To find the pattern in the transformation from input to output grids, we need to analyze how the numbers change. Here's what I notice:

1. All '4's in the input remain unchanged.
2. '2's in the input are replaced in various ways in the output, depending on their surroundings.

Let's observe the transformations more closely:

- In Example 1, '2's are replaced with '3's where they form a vertical line or are surrounded by other '2's horizontally.
- In Example 2, '2's are replaced with '3's when they are part of a horizontal span or have '2's above or below them.
- In Example 3, '2's are replaced with '3's where they form a cross pattern or a corner of a larger pattern.
- In Example 4, '2's are replaced with '3's if they are part of a larger vertical or horizontal pattern, or if they are at the end of such a pattern.

The common thread seems to be that '2' cells are transformed into '3' cells if they are not isolated and are part of a continuous cluster of '2' cells either vertically or horizontally or both.

For the Test Case, applying this rule:

Using this rule, let's transform the test grid:

- In the first row, nothing changes because there is no enclosed area.
- In the second row, the area between columns 4 to 7 gets filled with '9's since it’s surrounded by '2's.
- In the third and fourth rows, the area between columns 5 to 8 gets filled with '9's because it's enclosed by '2's.
- The rest of the grid remains unchanged due to the presence of '0's or lack of fully enclosed spaces.

99b1bc43,"To determine the transformation rule applied in the given examples, let's compare the patterns present in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Observing closely, we can see that all input grids contain a line of '4's in the middle which separates the top and bottom sections. We also observe that the bottom half of each grid is processed to generate specific values for the output grid. By analyzing the outputs, we can derive the following rule:

- If a color (number) is present in both the corresponding positions in the top and bottom halves of the input grid (above and below the line of '4's), the output cell at those positions is replaced with '0'.
- If a color (number) is present only in one of the corresponding positions in the top and bottom halves of the input grid, the output cell will have '3' instead.

Now let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input Test Case:
```
[[1, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1, 1],
 [4, 4, 4, 4],   # This line separates top and bottom halves.
 [2, 2, 0, 2],
 [0, 0, 2, 0],
 [2, 0, 0, 2],
 [0, 2, 0, 2]]
```

Let's break down the test case into its top and bottom halves, then compare them according to our rule:

Top Half:
```
[[1, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1, 1]]
```

Bottom Half:
```
[[2, 2, 0, 2],
 [0, 0, 2, 0],
 [2, 0, 0, 2],
 [0, 2, 0, 2]]
```

Applying the transformation rule:

- Column 1: Top has 1, Bottom has 2. Different -> Output value is 3.
- Column 2: Top has 0, Bottom has 0. Same -> Output value is 0.
- Column 3: Top has 1, Bottom has 2. Different -> Output value is 3.
- Column 4: Top has 1, Bottom has 2. Different -> Output value is 3.

This process is repeated for each row and column. Following this pattern, the output of the test case would be:
```

 [3, 3, 3, 0],

bc1d5164,"The pattern observed in the transformation of the input matrices into their respective outputs is that the output grid is composed by taking the first row of the input grid as the top row, the bottom row of the input grid as the middle row, and the last element of the first row plus the first two elements of the bottom row as the bottom row of the output grid.

Applying this to the test case:

Input:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]

Output according to the rule:
Top row from the input: `[0, 0, 0]`
Bottom row from the input: `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]` => Taking the last element (`1`) and the first two elements (`0, 1`): `[1, 0, 1]`

d364b489,"To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the provided examples. Let's analyze the examples step-by-step:

In Example 1:
- Each cell with a `1` in the input grid seems to get transformed into a `1` and its adjacent cells get new numbers which appear to move outward from the original position.
- There appears to be a specific sequence of numbers that replace the adjacent cells as the `1` moves through the grid.

In Example 2:
- This time, there are more than one `1`s in the input grid. Again, each `1` moves outwards, but this time the sequence of numbers changes based on the initial number being replaced.

From these examples, we can deduce the following pattern:
- If a cell has a value of `1`, the `1` will move outwards in a spiral manner from its position. 
- When the `1` is at position (row, col) in the input grid, in the output grid, the cells it moves through have values according to the following replacement sequence: 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 7.

We'll apply this pattern to the test case given:
Test Input Grid:
```
[
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Following the identified transformation rule:
- For the first `1` at position (0, 1), it would move outwards in this order: 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 7.
- For the second `1` at position (0, 9), it would also move outwards in the same order, starting from another direction.
- For the third `1` at position (2, 7), it would again follow the sequence: 1 -> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 7.
- And for the fourth `1` at positions (3, 3), (6, 0), and (9, 4), they all follow their respective outward spiral sequences.

So, let's transform each `1` accordingly:
1. **First `1` at (0, 1):**
   - Moves to (0, 0) as 2.
   - Then (1, 0) becomes 8.
   - Next, (2, 0) becomes 6.
   - Lastly, (2, 1) becomes 7.

2. **Second `1` at (0, 9):**
   - Moves to (0, 10) as 2 (out of bounds, so no change here).
   - Then (1, 9) becomes 8.
   - Next, (2, 9) becomes 6.
   - Lastly, (2, 8) becomes 7.

3. **Third `1` at (2, 7):**
   - Moves to (1, 7) as 2.
   - Then (1, 6) becomes 8.
   - Next, (0, 6) becomes 6.
   - Lastly, (0, 5) becomes 7.

4. **Fourth `1` at (3, 3):**
   - Moves to (3, 4) as 2.
   - Then (4, 4) becomes 8.
   - Next, (5, 4) becomes 6.
   - Lastly, (5, 3) becomes 7.

5. **Fifth `1` at (6, 0):**
   - Moves to (6, 1) as 2.
   - Then (7, 1) becomes 8.
   - Next, (7, 2) becomes 6.
   - Lastly, (6, 2) becomes 7.

6. **Sixth `1` at (9, 4):**
   - Moves to (9, 5) as 2.
   - Then (8, 5) becomes 8.
   - Next, (8, 6) becomes 6.
   - Lastly, (9, 6) becomes 7.

After applying these transformations to all the `1`s in the grid, the resulting grid looks like:
```python

 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],

178fcbfb,"The transformation rule applied seems to involve filling in the entire row and column with the value of the first non-zero color (from top to bottom and left to right) encountered in the original grid. This means that the first time any color appears in a row or column, it replaces all other zeros in that row and column with itself.

Applying this rule to the test case:

1. Scan the grid from top to bottom and left to right.
2. Identify the first non-zero element in each row and column.
3. Replace all zeros in that row and column with the identified non-zero element.

Let's apply this rule to your test case:

- Row 0: First non-zero element is 3, so replace all zeros in row 0 and column 4 with 3.
- Row 1: First non-zero element is 2, so replace all zeros in row 1 and column 10 with 2.
- Row 3: First non-zero element is 3, so replace all zeros in row 3 and column 6 with 3.
- Row 5: First non-zero element is 2, so replace all zeros in row 5 and column 5 with 2.
- Row 7: First non-zero element is 1, so replace all zeros in row 7 and column 1 with 1.
- Row 8: No non-zero elements, so no change.
- Row 9: First non-zero element is 1, so replace all zeros in row 9 and column 9 with 1.
- Row 10: No non-zero elements, so no change.

67a3c6ac,"The transformation rule appears to be rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise while also changing specific color values in the process. In all the examples provided, the number `6` in the input grid transforms into `2`, and the number `2` becomes `7` in the output grid. The other numbers remain unchanged. Now I'll apply the same transformation to the test case.

Step 1: Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.
```
[7, 6, 1],
[6, 7, 6],
[6, 2, 2]]
```
becomes
```
[7, 6, 6],
[6, 7, 2],
[1, 6, 2]
```

Step 2: Apply the transformation rules on the rotated grid.
- Change `6` to `2`
- Change `2` to `7`
So,
```
[7, 6, 6], -> [7, 2, 2]
[6, 7, 2], -> [2, 7, 6]
[1, 6, 2]  -> [1, 2, 7]

From the examples provided, we see that the output consists of the color that forms the largest continuous block on either the horizontal or vertical axis, and the output grid's size corresponds to the dimensions of the smallest such block.

For the test case, the color forming the largest contiguous blocks are 3s vertically and 9s horizontally. Since both 3s and 9s form large blocks, we need to identify which one forms the smallest block, which here is a vertical block of 3s:

d43fd935,"The pattern in the transformation from input to output seems to be that any color that appears at the edge of the grid or connected to an edge is spread across its row or column to fill in any blank spaces (0s) until it meets another non-zero color or reaches the end of the grid.

Applying that rule to the test case:

- The 2 in the first row spreads left and right, filling up all 0s in the first row except for the last one.
- The 2 at the start of the second row spreads to fill its entire row.
- The 2 on the eighth column of the third row spreads up and down to fill its entire column.
- The 6 on the fourth column of the fifth row spreads up and down to fill its entire column.
- The 6 on the eighth column of the fifth row spreads up and down to fill its entire column.
- The 6 on the fourth row spreads left and right to fill its entire row.
- The 3s in the seventh and eighth rows don't connect with any edge and stay as they are.
- There's no need to do anything else since all other cells are already filled or disconnected from edges.

228f6490,"To solve this puzzle, let's try to deduce the rule based on the given examples.

In Example 1:
- The color '6' was replaced by '0' in positions where '5' was present in the column above or below it.
- The color '7' remained unchanged since there were no '5's around it.
  
In Example 2:
- Similar to Example 1, the color '9' was replaced with '0' only when surrounded by '5's in the same column.

In Example 3:
- The color '2' was replaced by '0' only when surrounded by '5's or '8's in the same column.

Based on these observations, it seems the rule is to replace the color at the intersection if it is surrounded by the same color in the columns above and below it.

Let's apply this rule to the Test Case:

```
[
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2],
[2, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2],
[7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
[0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5],
[2, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]
```

By applying the rule:
- The '2' in the first row, 9th column should not change because it does not have '0's above and below it.
- The '2' in the second row, 9th column should not change because it does not have '0's above and below it.
- The '2' in the fifth row, 9th column should not change because it does not have '0's above and below it.
- The '2' in the ninth row, 1st column should not change because it does not have '0's above and below it.
- The '2' in the tenth row, 1st column should not change because it does not have '0's above and below it.
- The '4' in the third row, 7th column should be replaced by '0' because it has '5's above and below it.
- The '2' in the third row, 8th column should not change because it does not have '0's above and below it.
- The '2' in the ninth row, 8th column should be replaced by '0' because it has '5's above and below it.
- The '2' in the tenth row, 8th column should be replaced by '0' because it has '5's above and below it.
- The '7' in the sixth row, 1st column should not change because it does not have '7's above and below it.

22eb0ac0,"Analyzing the provided examples, it seems that the transformation rule involves changing all the cells in each row where there is a non-zero value at the start or end of the row into that non-zero value across the entire row.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- In the first row, both starting and ending values are 0, so no changes.
- In the second row, the starting value is 4 and the ending value is 2, so change all cells in the second row to 4.
- In the third row, both starting and ending values are 0, so no changes.
- In the fourth row, the starting value is 3 and the ending value is 3, so change all cells in the fourth row to 3.
- In the fifth row, both starting and ending values are 0, so no changes.
- In the sixth row, the starting value is 2 and the ending value is 9, so change all cells in the sixth row to 2.
- In the seventh row, both starting and ending values are 0, so no changes.
- In the eighth row, the starting value is 6 and the ending value is 6, so change all cells in the eighth row to 6.
- In the ninth row, both starting and ending values are 0, so no changes.
- In the tenth row, the starting value is 9 and the ending value is 4, but since we only consider the value on either end of the row which exists here, we fill the row with 9s.

41e4d17e,"The transformation rule seems to involve replacing certain parts of the input grid with a new color (6 in this case) based on the structure of the 1s within the otherwise solid 8 background.

Upon close inspection, the rule appears to be that any group of adjacent 1s (horizontally or vertically) surrounded entirely by 8s gets its outermost layer of 8s changed to 6s.

We apply this rule to the test case:
1. Identify all groups of 1s.
2. For each group, identify the surrounding 8s and change them to 6s.

Applying this rule:

- The first block of 1s (centered around column 7) has its outermost 8s changed to 6s.
- The second block of 1s (centered around column 10) has its outermost 8s changed to 6s.

Thus, the test case transforms into:

48d8fb45,"The pattern I observe from analyzing the examples is that the output contains only the colors that appear in the input but are not zeros. It seems to take the first occurrence of each non-zero color from left to right, top to bottom, and creates a smaller grid with these numbers. If the original color appears more than once horizontally, the output will contain the first and last occurrences of that color.

Based on the analysis, here's how we can apply this to the test case:

Test Case:
- The first non-zero color is 5 at position (0,6).
- The next non-zero color is 3 at position (0,7).
- The next non-zero color is also 3 at position (2,5), which is the first occurrence of this color in its row.
- We continue filling up the output based on the first and last occurrences of each non-zero color in their respective rows until we fill the smaller grid.

In each example, the first appearance of a non-zero number remains in place, while subsequent appearances move one step down and one step to the right, filling new positions until the edge of the grid is reached or there are no more occurrences of that number.

Applying this to the test case, we have a '8' appearing first at position (3,5) and then again at (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5). The output would then distribute these '8's along the diagonal starting from their initial position (3,5).

Applying this rule to the test case:

- At position `[0][3]` and `[0][5]`, there is an '8' with zeros surrounding it on both sides, so they expand to fill their surrounding zero positions.
- At position `[2][3]`, an '8' also exists with surrounding zeros, which similarly expands.

Specifically, if a number `X` is present in row `i`, then it appears in row `i+1` and possibly row `i-1` with some other number `Y`. In Example 1, the number `3` in the 8th row causes changes in the 9th row, and `2` in the 10th row results in a `1` being inserted below. In Example 2, and Example 3, similar patterns are followed. The number `4` seems to cause the appearance of `1` and `3` in the next row based on its position.

For the test case, we observe the following:
- The number `4` appears in row 4, which is causing modifications in row 5.
- The number `2` appears in row 10, which is causing modifications in row 11.

- Row 5 has `4`s at positions 2 and 3, 7 and 8, 13 and 14; these will be transformed to introduce a `1` and `3` in row 6.
- Row 10 has `4` at position 1 and 2, and `2` at position 8; this will transform row 11.
- Row 11 has `4` at position 2, 4, 8, and 10; this will transform row 12.

In the test case, the first non-zero digit is in the first column, so the transformation will keep '8' in the first column and form a pattern across the rest of the columns based on that.

1bfc4729,"The transformation rule appears to involve spreading out any non-zero number in a row to that entire row, and similarly expanding it vertically if there's a corresponding non-zero number in the same column but different rows. If there are multiple numbers in the same grid, their transformations do not interact with each other: each non-zero number independently causes its row and column to fill up with its respective value.

Given the Test input, we have two non-zero numbers: a 2 in the third row and fifth column, and an 8 in the eighth row and seventh column. Applying the rule:

- The 2 in the third row will cause the entire row to be filled with 2s.
- The 2 in the fifth column will cause the entire column to be filled with 2s.
- The 8 in the eighth row will cause the entire row to be filled with 8s.
- The 8 in the seventh column will cause the entire column to be filled with 8s.

Since both the 2 and 8 occupy different rows and columns, their transformations do not overlap except for the cell they both occupy.

In Example 1, the original grid contains specific patterns of numbers. The output grid is a smaller grid that seems to capture unique combinations of these numbers, specifically focusing on the first occurrence of distinct non-zero values from left to right and top to bottom.

Input 1:

Output 1:
```

In Example 2, the same pattern applies:

Output 2:
```
1188
1008
4002
4422
```

Based on these patterns, the rule appears to be:
- Start from the top-left corner of the grid.
- Traverse the grid row-wise, and for each row, traverse column-wise.
- Collect the first encountered instance of each distinct non-zero color in every row and put them into the output grid from left to right, starting a new row when the end of the current row is reached.
- If there are no non-zero colors in a row, skip that row.
- If a row has more than one distinct non-zero color, all subsequent occurrences of those colors should be ignored in favor of their first occurrence.

Given the test case:

```

Following the rule, we identify the distinct non-zero colors in the rows in order:
- Row 2 has no non-zero value.
- Row 3 has 6 and 8.
- Row 4 has 6 and 8 (but 6 has already been seen).
- Row 5 has no non-zero value.
- Row 6 has no non-zero value.
- Row 7 has 1.
- Row 8 has 1 (already seen) and 1 again (already seen).
- Row 9 has no non-zero value.
- Row 10 has 3.
- Row 11 has 3 (already seen).

So, the sequence of first appearances of non-zero distinct colors in the rows are:
1. 6, 8
2. 8 (no change, 6 is already seen)
3. 1
4. 1 (no change, already seen)
5. 3 (no change, 3 is already seen)

Thus the resulting grid would be:
```
[6, 8, 1, 3]
[6, 8, 1, 3]
```

Since the rule requires us to stop after getting unique elements from the first appearance and fill the grid based on the number of distinct colors identified:
The final output grid becomes:

d687bc17,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's analyze the provided examples.

In the first training example, there appears to be a pattern where certain elements in the rows and columns adjacent to specific numbers (like '0', '4', and '7') are either unchanged or modified by spreading the neighboring number's color. Observing these changes, we can notice that:

1. When a '0' borders an area of the same color (e.g., '4'), the bordering '0' changes to that color.
2. '4' spreads its color to zeros in the adjacent rows if there's no other number between them.
3. '7' spreads to zeros in its column but it seems to stop when another number is encountered.

In the second training example, similar patterns exist with the number '1' and '7':
- The '1' spreads its color to zeros in the next row if there is no intervening number.
- The '7' spreads its color to zeros in its column but stops at any intervening number.

The third training example exhibits the same behavior for '6' and '8':
- The '6' spreads its color to zeros in the next row without interruption.
- The '8' spreads to zeros in its column until another number interrupts.

Applying these observations to the test case, we need to apply the spreading rule for '4', '8', and '2'.

Test Case Analysis:
- '4' spreads across its row where it meets zeros.
- '8' spreads down its column until it meets a different color.
- '2' spreads across its row similarly to how '4' does.

Based on these rules, here is the solution for the test case:

In all examples, the rows following the initial blocks of 7s and before the blocks of 4s are transformed into a pattern where some 7s become 0s and others become 3s in the output grid. The exact transformation seems to depend on the presence or absence of 7s in the row and columns above and below the current one.

For the test case, applying the same logic:

- First four rows with 7s are ignored.
- Row 5 with 4s are ignored.
- Starting from row 6 and considering the pattern of 7s above:
  - 2s are replaced by 0s,
  - And wherever there's a 7 in the previous rows (that isn't directly part of the row being considered), a 3 appears instead of a 0.

   In Example 3, the input grid of size 3x3 is first duplicated horizontally then vertically to form a 6x6 grid, but with some additional manipulations. Specifically, the rightmost column of the original grid is moved to the middle of the new grid, and the bottom row is adjusted accordingly.

From these examples, it seems the general rule is to duplicate the input grid both horizontally and vertically to produce a grid that is twice the size in each dimension. Additionally, there might be some specific rearrangements involving the central column and row for certain cases.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case

**Input Grid (Test Case):**
```
[
[1, 4, 1],
[4, 9, 4],
[9, 1, 9]]
```

- Start by duplicating the grid horizontally. This means placing the columns side by side:
  ```
  [
  [1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1],
  [4, 9, 4, 4, 9, 4],
  [9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9]]
  ```

- Next, duplicate the resulting horizontal grid vertically (place the rows on top of each other):
  ```
  [
  [1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1],
  [4, 9, 4, 4, 9, 4],
  [9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9],
  [1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1],
  [4, 9, 4, 4, 9, 4],
  [9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9]]
  ```

This pattern matches the duplication rule seen in the examples.

In all the examples, the transformation appears to fill surrounding zeros with the neighboring non-zero number if that number has an adjacent cell containing it. This process seems to propagate outwards from the initial non-zero cells until there's no further change.

For the test case, let's apply this rule.

- If the grid has an equal number of 2s and 0s in a symmetrical pattern with the center being 2 surrounded by 0s, the result is `1`.
- If the grid has a more complex pattern including diagonally placed 2s and 0s where there is a diagonal symmetry with at least one 2 on both the top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left diagonals, the result is `7`.

Given the test case:
```
[
[2, 0, 2],
[2, 2, 2],

```

This grid has a central row entirely filled with 2s, and the outer rows have 2s in the first and third columns. This doesn't match a purely symmetrical pattern around a central 2 surrounded by 0s, but instead has a unique form of diagonal symmetry.

Applying the same reasoning as the previous examples, since the grid includes a diagonal symmetry (with 2 on the top-left to bottom-right diagonal), it should produce an output of `7`.

ded97339,"The pattern observed in the transformations seems to propagate the value 8 horizontally and vertically from the initial positions until it meets another non-zero value or reaches the edge of the grid. Here's how the pattern propagates based on the examples:

- In Example 1, the 8 in the fourth row spreads across the entire row and down to fill the eighth row.
- In Example 2, the 8s on the seventh row spread horizontally to fill the entire seventh row, and the 8s in the first and eighth column spread vertically.
- In Example 3, the 8s in the second and sixth columns spread vertically, and those in the second and sixth rows spread horizontally.

Given the Test case, we should apply this propagation rule to the value 8.

Test Case:

Based on this, we can derive the output:
- The 8 in the second row will spread horizontally to fill the entire second row.
- The 8 in the third row at the fourth position will propagate vertically to fill the corresponding column.
- The 8 in the fourth row will spread horizontally to fill the entire fourth row.
- The 8 in the ninth row will propagate both horizontally and vertically, filling the respective row and column.

ff28f65a,"To solve this puzzle, we'll need to identify the rule that transforms the given input grids into their respective output grids.

Observing the examples, a pattern emerges where the output grid represents the presence or absence of the color '2' in certain positions of the input grid:

1. If there is a group of consecutive '2's horizontally or vertically (in the original input), then in the corresponding position of the output grid, there is a '1'.
2. The output grid is generally smaller than the input grid; specifically, if we assume the input grid has dimensions m x n, the output grid typically has dimensions m/2 x n/2.
3. Each cell in the output grid seems to summarize the state of a 2x2 block from the input grid:
   - If any 2x2 block contains at least one '2', the top-left cell of that block in the output grid is set to 1.
   - Otherwise, it is set to 0.
4. Blocks that do not contain '2' are summarized as '0'.

Taking the Test Case into consideration:

Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0],
[2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0],
[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

We can break it down into 2x2 blocks and apply our rule:

1. First Block: 
   ```
   [0, 0],
   [0, 0] -> 0
   ```
2. Second Block: 
   ```
   [0, 0],
   [0, 2] -> 1
   ```
3. Third Block:
   ```
   [0, 2],
   [2, 2] -> 1
   ```
4. Fourth Block: 
   ```
   [2, 2],
   [2, 2] -> 1
   ```
5. Fifth Block:
   ```
   [0, 0],
   [0, 0] -> 0
   ```
6. Sixth Block:
   ```
   [0, 0],
   [0, 0] -> 0
   ```

Putting these results together, the output grid becomes:
``` 
[
[0, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0]
]
```

However, since the output grid is supposed to be half the size in both dimensions, and the test case suggests the output should be a 3x3 grid, let's re-check if we are summarizing correctly for a consistent 3x3 grid representation:

1st Column, Row 1: 
```
[0, 0],
[0, 0], [0, 0], [2, 2]
-> 0
```
2nd Column, Row 1: 
```
[0, 0],
[0, 2], [2, 2], [0, 0]
-> 1
```
3rd Column, Row 1: 
```
[2, 2],
[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]
-> 1
```

1st Column, Row 2:
```
[2, 2],
[2, 2], [0, 2], [0, 0]
-> 1
```
2nd Column, Row 2:
```
[0, 0],
[2, 2], [2, 2], [0, 0]
-> 1
```
3rd Column, Row 2:
```
[0, 0],
[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]
-> 0
```

Thus, the correct 3x3 output summary grid would be:
```
[
[0, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0]

- 1 appears horizontally in one instance at position [5][4].

0962bcdd,"Examining the transformation from the input to the output grids closely, it seems that where a color (non-zero value) appears in the input, the neighboring cells (horizontally or vertically but not diagonally) in the output get filled with a specific pattern of numbers. In both examples, the pattern involves wrapping around the given color and its adjacent positions with a certain number, effectively creating a ""frame"" around the original color.

In Example 1, the color `7` is wrapped in a frame of `2`s. In Example 2, the color `8` is wrapped in a frame of `6`s. Therefore, for the test case, we should look at the color present in the input and apply the appropriate transformation. 

The test input has the color `3`. So, let's wrap this color with another number, which is derived from the previous examples. We'll assume the number to wrap around is `4`, based on the closest observation that different non-zero values create different frames. But since there are only two examples, and `4` only appears alongside `3` without acting as a frame color, I'll infer `4` as the frame color for `3`.

Applying the transformation:
- Replace all zeros (background) with zero.
- For every `3` in the input, fill its directly adjacent cells (left, right, top, bottom) with `4` in the output grid.

- The number 5 transforms into a different number depending on its position.
- The number 0 is transformed into a single number for a whole row or column.

In Example 1, the central 5 remains in the middle row and column but gets assigned different values above and below it.
- Row 1: All zeros become 3.
- Row 2: The center 5 becomes 4.
- Row 3: All zeros become 2.

In Example 2, all zeros transform into 3 since there's no 5 present.
In Example 3, the central 5 is in the middle row and columns to the right, so the transformation pattern differs.
- Row 1: All zeros become 2.
- Row 2: The center 5 becomes 4.
- Row 3: All zeros become 2.

In Example 4, the pattern changes again due to the different positions of 5.

Applying the rule to our test case:
- First row: No changes as there is only one '1' and it is surrounded by '0's.
- Second and ninth rows: All '0's next to '1's will become '2'.
- Third and eighth rows: The '0's next to the '1's will change to '2'.
- Fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh rows will follow the same logic.

b8cdaf2b,"Analyzing the examples provided:

- In Example 1, the value 2 was replaced with 4 in the first row.
- In Example 2, every instance of 0 around an 8 was replaced with 3.
- In Example 3, every instance of 0 directly above or below a 6 was replaced with 1.
- In Example 4, every instance of 0 directly above or below a 2 was replaced with 4.

Based on these patterns, we can deduce that for each row in the grid, if there's a non-zero value in a row, then any zero located in positions directly above or below that row should be replaced by that non-zero value (if there's more than one such non-zero value in the row, then only one instance of 0 is changed).

Applying this rule to the Test Case grid:

The non-zero values are found in the last two rows. The zeros directly above them need to be transformed into their corresponding non-zero values:

- The row with 8s is immediately above the row with both 2s and 8s, so all zeros in the row directly above it (the 7th row) should be transformed to 8.
- Similarly, the row with 2s is immediately above the row with all 8s, so all zeros in the row directly above it (the 8th row) should be transformed to 2.

Thus, the 8th row should change from `[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]` to `[2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2]`, and the 7th row remains unchanged since there are no zeros directly below 8s.

dae9d2b5,"To solve the puzzle, let's analyze the transformation rule applied in the examples:

From analyzing the examples, we see a pattern where specific numbers transform into a new number in certain columns.

- In all examples, whenever there is a 4 or a 3 in a column, all entries in that column transform into 6.
- Additionally, if a column consists entirely of zeros, it remains as such.

Based on these rules, here's how we can approach solving the test case:
We need to check each column in the input grid to see if it contains any 4s or 3s. If it does, all numbers in that column should be transformed into 6.

Input grid:
```
[
[0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0],
[4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0],
[0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0]]
```

Columns:
1. [0, 4, 0] - Contains 4, so it transforms to [6, 6, 6]
2. [4, 0, 4] - Contains 4s, so it transforms to [6, 6, 6]
3. [4, 0, 0] - Contains 4, so it transforms to [6, 6, 6]
4. [3, 3, 3] - Contains 3s, so it transforms to [6, 6, 6]
5. [0, 3, 0] - Contains 3, so it transforms to [6, 6, 6]
6. [0, 0, 0] - No 4s or 3s, remains [0, 0, 0]

So the output grid would look like:

```python
[
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],

Given that rule, we can deduce that the test case would follow similarly where all 5s will be transformed into either 1 or 2. Let's replace them based on the pattern observed:

- The first distinct group of 5s appears in the first row, third to fifth columns, transforming those 5s to 1.
- The next group in the third row starting from the first column also appears to transform to 1.

d406998b,"The transformation rule seems to involve replacing certain occurrences of the number 5 with the number 3. Observing the patterns:

1. In Example 1, all instances of 5 are replaced by 3 in the third column.
2. In Example 2, all instances of 5 are replaced by 3 except for the first occurrence in each row.
3. In Example 3, all instances of 5 are replaced by 3 except for the first and the last occurrences in each row.
4. In Example 4, all instances of 5 are replaced by 3 except for the first three and the last three occurrences in each row.

From these examples, we can infer that the rule is to replace all but the first few and last few occurrences of 5 in each row. In Example 1, no initial or final numbers are kept as 5; in Example 2, the first instance of 5 is kept; in Example 3, the first and last instance of 5 are kept; and in Example 4, the first three and the last three instances of 5 in each row are kept.

Given the pattern, let's apply the rule where only the first and last instances of 5 in each row are maintained as 5, and the rest are transformed into 3.

Test Case Transformation:
- First row: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0] -> Replace all except the first and last 5.
- Second row: [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0] -> Replace all except the first and last 5.
- Third row: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5] -> Replace all except the first and last 5.

Applying this rule to each row, we get:
- For the first row: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]
- For the second row: [5, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
- For the third row: [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3]

So the solution to the test case is:

For the test case:
- We identify the rectangle with non-zero numbers starting from the first row that has them until the last row that has them.
- For each row within this rectangle, we replicate the sequence of numbers at the beginning of the row until the first zero, and place those replicas on both sides of the original row.
- We then fill in the middle sections with zeros, except for any ones present in the original rows.

93b581b8,"The transformation rule applied to the grids in the examples seems to be mirroring and extending the non-zero elements found in the center of the grid towards its edges.

Here's a closer look at how it works based on the provided examples:
1. For each row and column in the grid, if there are non-zero elements, they need to be mirrored across the central axis (vertical and horizontal).
2. If there is a color (non-zero value) at position `[i][j]`, then that color should also appear at positions `[i][len(row)-j-1]` for horizontal mirroring and `[len(grid)-i-1][j]` for vertical mirroring.
3. The mirrored colors are extended towards the edges, but only one layer thick on both sides, which means the first and last rows/columns (excluding the middle one) get one additional copy of the mirror image.

150deff5,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to obtain their corresponding outputs, we need to observe the patterns in these examples.

In each example, the color `5` in the input grid is being replaced with a combination of `2` and `8`. Specifically, `5` becomes `8` for cells that are at the edge of the '5'-filled regions, while cells that are not at the edge become '2'.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
```python
[
[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Based on the rule described, let's analyze and transform each cell:

1. The first row has a '5' block surrounded by zeros. The block consists of two '5's side-by-side.
   - Edge cells: `[1][2]`, `[1][3]`, `[1][6]`, `[1][7]`
   - Interior cells: `[1][5]`

2. The second row also has a '5' block surrounded by zeros, but it is staggered.
   - Edge cells: `[2][2]`, `[2][3]`, `[2][6]`
   - Interior cells: `[2][4]`

3. The third row has a larger block of '5's.
   - Edge cells: `[3][1]`, `[3][2]`, `[3][7]`, `[3][8]`
   - Interior cells: `[3][3]`, `[3][4]`, `[3][5]`, `[3][6]`

4. The fourth row has a block of three consecutive '5's.
   - Edge cells: `[4][4]`, `[4][5]`, `[4][6]`
   - Interior cells: None

5. The fifth row continues the block from the fourth row.
   - Edge cells: `[5][3]`, `[5][4]`, `[5][5]`
   - Interior cells: None

6. The sixth row has a block of two '5's.
   - Edge cells: `[6][5]`, `[6][6]`
   - Interior cells: None

7. The seventh row also has a block of two '5's.
   - Edge cells: `[7][5]`, `[7][6]`
   - Interior cells: None

Following the rule:
- '5' in edge positions of blocks gets replaced by '8'.
- '5' in interior positions of blocks gets replaced by '2'.

ea32f347,"The operation in all provided examples seems to be converting any vertical segment of consecutive 5s into a gradient starting from 1 at the top and ending with 4 at the bottom. If there's only one 5 or if there's no other 5 directly above or below it, it gets converted to 1. For horizontal segments of consecutive 5s, it starts from 1 on the leftmost 5 and ends with 2 on the rightmost 5, with intermediate numbers being 4 (if there are more than two 5s side by side).

- The first vertical column of 5s transforms into a column with numbers starting from 1 at the top to 4 at the bottom.
- The horizontal row of 5s transforms into a row with numbers starting from 1 at the leftmost position and ending with 2 at the rightmost position, with intermediate positions getting 4.
- The second vertical column of 5s transforms similarly to the first one vertically.

e98196ab,"The transformation rule seems to involve keeping certain rows intact while rearranging others, focusing on rows with non-zero values other than the '5' filled rows. It involves moving all non-zero values from the bottommost rows (not filled with '5') upwards until they reach the topmost row that contains a '5', and then filling in the rest of the rows with a pattern that reflects these moved values.

From the examples provided, we can see that rows with only zeros remain unchanged, rows filled with '5' stay the same, and other rows get stacked up to fill the top rows until the first '5'-filled row is reached. For any rows above the '5'-filled one, if they contain non-zero values, those non-zero values get stacked above the '5'-filled row, starting from the bottom.

Let's apply this understanding to the test case:

- The bottommost rows containing non-zero values other than '5' are [6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0], and [6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
- We move these rows upwards.
- The row with '5' fills the gap left below it, and the rows above it reflect the pattern of non-zero values stacked up from the bottom.

Given the structure, the '5' filled row is at index 5. So, the rows with non-zero values other than '5' would move up into the spaces above, starting with the closest non-zero row to the '5' filled row.

Therefore, here's the transformed grid for the test case:

Applying this rule to the test case:

The input grid has several rows with the first four columns containing only zeros. Thus, their respective output columns will also contain zeros. For rows that have non-zero elements, only the rightmost non-zero column is retained in the output.

Second, place zeros in the upper part of the grid where those numbers were previously and move the identified blocks to the bottom. Fill the remaining spaces with ""8"".

So, following the rule:

All ""2""s and ""3""s are in the first four rows. After removing them and filling the empty spaces with zeros, we should see all ""8""s above the lowest row containing the original ""2""s and ""3""s.

1. In Example 1, the number 2 in the third row is transformed into an alternating sequence of 2 and 5 across that row.
2. In Example 2, the number 2 in the second row and the number 3 in the fifth row are transformed into an alternating sequence of their respective numbers and 5.
3. In Example 3, the number 8 in the fourth row is transformed into an alternating sequence of 8 and 5.

The pattern observed is that any non-zero integer in a row gets replaced by an alternating sequence of that number and 5 for that entire row.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The number 3 in the second row should get replaced with an alternating sequence of 3 and 5.
- The number 4 in the third row should get replaced with an alternating sequence of 4 and 5.
- The number 8 in the fifth row should get replaced with an alternating sequence of 8 and 5.
- The number 2 in the seventh row should get replaced with an alternating sequence of 2 and 5.

- Identify all non-zero numbers in the input grid.
- For the output grid, select the rightmost occurrence of each unique number that appears in the input grid, and create a smaller grid with those values only.

For the test case provided:
- The non-zero numbers present are 2 and 8.
- The rightmost occurrences of these numbers appear in the last three rows of the input grid, specifically in columns where they are the last ones to appear from right to left.

Therefore, we extract `2` from column 5 of row 4, `8` from column 7 of row 7, and the `8` from column 8 of row 7, row 8, and row 9. Combining these into a smaller 3x3 grid, we get:

- In Example 1, the input grid was vertically elongated by adding a copy of each row at the end, but with a shift such that the first and last elements of each new row correspond to the original row's last and first elements respectively.
- In Example 2 and Example 3, similar transformations occurred.

In all cases, each row appears again at the end of the new grid but shifted by one position to the right relative to its original position. Additionally, if there’s a 7, then the mirrored positions across the center of the new grid also get a 7.

Analysis:
- There's a vertical column containing 3s starting from row 4, column 1 and ending at row 6, column 1.
- There's a horizontal row containing 3s starting from row 6, column 2 and ending at row 6, column 4.
- These sequences don't overlap in such a way that they would be merged.

Output:

6fa7a44f,"To solve the given test case, let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided examples:

- Each input grid is transformed into an output grid that has twice the number of rows.
- The first half of the output contains the original rows from the input grid.
- The second half mirrors the first half, but in reverse order.

Applying this rule to the test case:

e40b9e2f,"The pattern observed in the examples suggests that any non-zero value within the grid is getting expanded into its adjacent cells horizontally and vertically. When we look closely at how the non-zero elements spread out:

- In Example 1, the '4' and '7' expand to fill up the horizontal gaps next to them.
- In Example 2, '3' and '6' follow the same expansion rule.
- In Example 3, '2' and '9', and the '8' also follows this rule, but '8' remains unchanged as it's already surrounded.

For the test case, we apply the same logic:
- Expand the '2' to fill the horizontal gaps.
- The '3' already has some neighbors, so it will expand both horizontally and vertically where possible.

Based on these observations, here's the solution for the test case:

1. In the first row of the grid, no changes appear to have been made.
2. In subsequent rows, any '0' that has a '5' directly above it in the previous row turns into a '2'.
3. Any '5' that has a '0' directly above it in the previous row turns into a '2'.

Using these rules, here's how we apply the transformation to the test case:

Applying the rules to each row following the first one:

- Second row: No '0' under a '5', so unchanged.
- Third row: Two '0's under '5's in the second row, so those two '0's become '2's.
- Fourth row: Two '0's under '5's in the third row, so those two '0's become '2's.
- Fifth row: Three '0's under '5's in the fourth row, so those three '0's become '2's.
- Sixth row: First '5' under a '0' in the fifth row, so that '5' becomes '2'.
- Seventh row: First '0' under '5', so that '0' becomes '2'. Second '0' under a '0', so unchanged.
- Eighth row: All '0's under '5's in the seventh row, so all '0's in the eighth row become '2's.
- Ninth row: All '0's under '5's in the eighth row, so all '0's in the ninth row become '2's.
- Tenth row: Third '0' under a '5' in the ninth row, so that '0' becomes '2'.

e26a3af2,"By observing the examples provided, we can see that each output grid has the same dimensions but only contains the most frequent value in each row from the corresponding input grid.

For Example 1, the most frequent numbers in each row are all 2s and 8s, except for the first four rows where 1 is more common. In the output, these rows are filled with just 1s and 8s based on their prevalence across the entire row.

The same pattern applies to Example 2 and Example 3.

In the Test Case, the most frequent number in each row is:
- First row: 1
- Second row: 1
- Third row: 1
- Fourth row: 2
- Fifth row: 2
- Sixth row: 2
- Seventh row: 2
- Eighth row: 8
- Ninth row: 8
- Tenth row: 8
- Eleventh row: 4
- Twelfth row: 4
- Thirteenth row: 4
- Fourteenth row: 3

Therefore, the transformation rule is to replace every other number in the grid with the most frequent number found in that row.

Applying the same logic to the test case:

- The zero in the second row should become a one because it's surrounded by twos.
- Similarly, each isolated zero in the third row (surrounded by twos) should also become a one.
- For rows below, any isolated zero (surrounded by twos or fives) should be transformed according to the rule. If it's surrounded by twos on both sides either horizontally or vertically, change it to one; otherwise, keep it as a zero.

First, let's change rows and columns affected by 8 and 7:
- Row 1 and Column 5 get filled with 8 because of the 8 in position (2, 5).
- Row 7 and Column 2 get filled with 7 because of the 7 in position (7, 2).

Then, fill in the specific secondary color cells:
- Position (6, 7) becomes 2 as per the observed pattern from previous examples.

Therefore, the transformed grid would look like this:

f8b3ba0a,"The pattern observed in these examples seems to involve filtering out unique color sequences from the input grid. For every unique sequence of two colors that appears vertically, there is a corresponding single number in the output array. The output seems to reflect the first unique sequence that occurs in the input grid vertically, followed by subsequent unique sequences in the order they appear.

Examining the inputs and outputs closely, we can see a consistent pattern where:
- Each output entry corresponds to the first occurrence of a vertical pair in the input.
- The values in the output represent the second color in the vertical pairs, with the first value being the one that does not repeat in the same vertical column before it.

For the test case, let's apply the same logic:

1. The first occurrence of a non-repeating vertical pair in the provided test input grid is [2, 1]. So, the output should include 1.
2. The next unique pair is [1, 4], so the output should include 4.
3. The next unique pair is [4, 8], so the output should include 8.

Therefore, the test case should produce the following output:

6e82a1ae,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids.

Upon analyzing the provided examples, there seems to be a process where distinct clusters of '5's in the input grid are replaced with different single-digit numbers in the output grid. Specifically, it appears that each cluster of '5's is replaced by a unique number starting from '1' upwards for each new separate cluster found in the input.

Clusters can be identified by considering adjacent cells sharing borders where '5's are present. Each such cluster gets assigned a different number in the output grid.

Let's apply this logic to the test case:

Input Grid:
```

There seem to be four clusters of '5's, which we would replace with '1', '2', '3', and '4'.

Cluster 1:

This entire block is one cluster, so it should all be transformed to '1'.

Cluster 2:

a3325580,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze what happens in each of the provided examples:

1. In Example 1, the output consists of the colors 4, 6, and 8, which appear at least once in the input grid.
2. In Example 2, similar to the first example, the transformation lists all distinct colors in the input grid that have appeared vertically in the rightmost column. The output lists the colors 9 and 4.
3. In Example 3, we find the color 2 appears multiple times in the last few rows and columns. The output is [[2], [2], [2]].
4. In Example 4, the colors 8 and 4 are present in the input grid but only color 8 appears in the output as it is the one appearing the most continuously from bottom to top in a vertical line.
5. In Example 5, we see colors 2 and 3 being listed in the output despite their sparse appearance, emphasizing they should be picked if they exist anywhere in the vertical columns.
6. Example 6 showcases that even if color 1 is not in the last row, it still gets included in the output based on its vertical presence.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:
- Identify which colors appear in any vertical column, focusing the last column (or columns) that contains non-zero colors.
- List these colors vertically, starting from the bottom and moving upwards. If a color is present in the last column or any column to the left of it, then include it in the output starting with the bottom row.

Applying the identified rule to the test case:

- The test case has colors 0, 1, 5, 8, 9, and 2.
- We focus on the columns containing non-zero values:
  - Color 1 is present in several columns including the last column.
  - Color 5 is present in the second last column.
  - Color 8 is present in the third last column.
  - Color 9 is present in the sixth column.
  - Color 2 is present in the eighth column.
  
Thus, the order from bottom to top, taking into account the appearance of colors in the last columns, would be 2 (from the 8th column), 9, 8, 5, and 1.

Therefore, the transformed grid for the test case will be:

Answer: ```[[9, 5, 2, 1], [9, 5, 2, 1], [9, 5, 2, 1]]```","[[9 5 2 1]

a87f7484,"The transformation rule seems to be that each output grid contains only one unique number, which appears in every row of the output. This number is the most frequent integer within the corresponding rows of the input grid. Let's apply this rule to the test case.

For rows in the test case:
- First three rows contain '5', which appears twice.
- Fourth and fifth rows contain '3', which also appears twice.
- Sixth and seventh rows contain '6', and appear twice.
- Eighth row contains '6' twice and '0' once, but '6' is still the most frequent.
- Ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth rows, similarly, contain '4' and '8' respectively, each appearing twice.

So, we choose the most frequent number from all these rows, which is '6' (appears in more rows than any other single digit).

Answer: ```[[6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6]]```

Actually, upon correct analysis of the rule, the output should contain the most frequently occurring number among all rows of the input grid. In the test case provided, all numbers (5, 3, 6, 4, 8) have appeared an equal number of times in different sets of rows. Since the goal is to choose just one color for the entire output grid, based on the highest frequency or the first occurrence with the same frequency, the solution should reflect the most frequent pattern in terms of its appearance across rows, which would be '0' alternating with another number since no single number dominates across all rows. However, strictly following the examples where a singular number takes over, we infer that the transformation rule may prioritize based on the visual grid structure rather than just numerical frequency, focusing on a specific pattern or the first dominant pattern seen if frequencies match.

Upon re-evaluating the examples, it's clear the rule is to keep the dominant pattern in the input as it is in the output. Thus, the first pattern of non-zero numbers that repeats fully in a coherent block is selected.

Applying the rule correctly:
The first repeating full pattern is '5':

Observing the examples, it seems the transformation involves identifying specific patterns or conditions within the input grid and mapping them to certain numbers in the output grid.

Upon careful analysis of the provided examples, I noticed the following rules:

1. If there's a color (non-zero number) at the edge of the input grid and no consecutive sequence of the same color directly adjacent to it (i.e., horizontally or vertically), it results in a 3 in the output grid.
2. If there are no edges with non-zero colors or if they form sequences, then those positions in the output grid are filled with 0.

For the test case:

 [0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0],
 [7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5]]
```

Let's apply these rules:
- The only color at the edge is 5 at position (0, 5).
- There is another 5 at position (1, 5) and (1, 6), forming a sequence horizontally, so no 3 appears for these positions.
- On the bottom row, there is a single 7 at position (3, 0), which does not form a sequence with other 7s on its edge, so a 3 would appear at the corresponding position in the output grid.

Specifically, for regions that are entirely filled with '8' on the edges or surrounded by '8', these regions remain unchanged. However, when there's a shift or a specific block formation inside these '8' boundaries - like blocks of '6' - they get transformed into different color codes.

Let's identify the rule:
- The '8' boundary remains intact.
- For any internal '6' region surrounded by '8', if the '6' forms a continuous block horizontally or vertically, the outer rows or columns of these blocks transform into '3'.

3f7978a0,"The transformation rule applied in these examples seems to be the extraction of the central part of the input grid containing non-zero elements only. In each example, the output represents the middle columns and rows that have numbers (colors) other than zero.

For Example 1, the input grid has non-zero elements primarily in the central five columns and rows, which is extracted for the output.

For Example 2, the non-zero elements are in a somewhat larger area but the output still maintains the core central structure with non-zero elements.

For Example 3, similar to the previous two examples, the output is a grid containing only those parts that had non-zero elements, in the center.

Considering the non-zero elements, we would extract the central area which would consist of the following rows and columns in this case:
- Rows from 4 to 10 (inclusive), since they contain the non-zero elements.
- Columns from 1 to 5 (inclusive), as they have numbers that form the core pattern.

Extracting these rows and columns yields:

25d487eb,"The transformation rule in all three examples appears to involve spreading a central color value towards the middle of the grid or filling the area below a non-zero element with that element's value.

In Example 1, the number `1` on row 4, column 4 spreads to the right until it meets another non-zero element (`2`) and stops. It keeps spreading to the right even when the color changes from `2` back to `1`.

In Example 2, the number `8` moves downwards and turns the entire row below it into `8`. The number `3` remains unaffected since nothing is changing around it.

In Example 3, the `2` at row 6, column 5 spreads down rows until the end of the grid.

For the test case, the number `4` starts to spread from row 11, column 5 and continues to fill down until row 15, column 5. Similarly, the number `8` also spreads down from row 14, column 5.

42a50994,"Based on the provided examples, the transformation rule seems to be that any number present in the input grid is removed except for those that form a direct vertical or horizontal line across the entire grid. If a number breaks the continuity of such a line, it gets removed.

For instance, in Example 1, the number `8` forms a continuous vertical line through the grid, and all `8`s that are not part of this vertical line get removed. 

Similarly, in Example 2, the number `5` forms a direct horizontal line in some rows, but only those `5`s that form a continuous horizontal line from start to end are kept. In the last row, there is a `5` in the middle that does not contribute to a full horizontal line, so it gets removed.

In the Test Case, we have numbers `3` forming some direct lines, while others break the continuity.

After analyzing the test grid with this rule, the answer would be:

39a8645d,"The examples seem to suggest that the output grid is formed by identifying any contiguous blocks of the same number which form a square or are surrounded on all sides by zeros in the input grid. The transformation rule appears to take only the central value of these identified blocks and places it in the output grid.

For instance, in Example 1, there is a block of 8s forming a cross shape, but only the central part of the cross (a 3x3 square) with the 8s is used to generate the output, which is then trimmed to the size of 3x3 centered around the middle 8.

In Example 2, there are two blocks of 4s forming a cross shape horizontally and vertically, respectively. Only the central part of each block, which forms a 3x3 square, is taken into account for generating the output.

Similarly, in Example 3, the central parts of the blocks of 3s and 2s are used to make the output, with the block of 8s being ignored since it doesn't form a complete square on its own.

Given this, the rules can be summarized as follows:

- Find any continuous squares of numbers that stand alone or form a complete square within a larger shape.
- Extract the central 3x3 grid from those squares and discard the rest.
- If no such squares exist, the output could be an empty grid or simply non-existent.

Applying the same logic to the test case, we need to locate any standalone or complete square blocks. In the test case, there are two such blocks: one of 2s at the center and one of 3s above it.

Let's extract the central 3x3 block from the 2s and the 3s:

For the 2s (Test case):
```plaintext
[2, 2, 0]
[2, 2, 2]
[0, 2, 2]
```
Central 3x3 block:
```plaintext
[2, 2, 2]
[2, 2, 2]
[2, 2, 0]
```

For the 3s (Test case):
```plaintext
[3, 3, 0]
[3, 0, 3]
[0, 3, 3]
```
Central 3x3 block:
```plaintext
[3, 0, 3]
[0, 3, 0]
[3, 0, 3]
```
Since the rule requires the central parts of only complete squares, we have to choose the one that forms a complete square and discard the other.

In this instance, the block of 2s forms a complete 3x3 square, while the block of 3s does not fully form such a square:

In the test case, we see there are several blocks of numbers, but the largest contiguous block is the one containing 5s. So, we'll keep only those and replace all other numbers with 0.

d13f3404,"The pattern in the given examples seems to involve shifting the elements of each row to the left and appending them to the next row with a shift that results in a kind of diagonal continuity from the first grid to the resulting one. Specifically, for each row in the input grid, the elements move diagonally down-left into the output grid. Each row gets duplicated in the output, but shifted left by one position compared to the row above it.

Using this logic, the solution for the test case would be:

In Example 1, we start with a small grid containing a 2x2 block of 3s and a 2x2 block of 2s. The output shows an expanded version where the 3s form a larger square occupying the upper left quadrant of the new 9x9 grid, leaving the lower right quadrant empty, and the 2s are similarly expanded to occupy the top two rows and the left two columns, but the 3s overwrite them where they overlap.

In Example 2, we see a similar pattern: a smaller grid with a vertical line of 2 and 3, becomes a 9x9 grid where the 3s form a rectangle covering the bottom half of the grid while the 2s form a rectangle covering the middle column, but the 3s again overwrite the 2s wherever they overlap.

Applying this logic to the test case:
- The input has a vertical line of 3s in the first two rows.
- There's also a single 2 in the second row, first column.

We identify the zeros that meet the criteria in the second and third rows and some zeros in the sixth row. 

Let's transform them according to the rule:
- In the second row, there are zeros at indices 4 and 5 which are bounded by '8' and '2'.
- In the third row, there are zeros beginning from index 3.
- In the sixth row, zeros starting from index 3 also meet the condition.

Applying these transformations:

239be575,"To solve this puzzle, I need to decipher the transformation rule being applied from the provided examples. 

Looking at the examples, we can observe that the output grid contains only one row with one element. The element in the output is either 0 or 8. Let's investigate how this value is determined based on the input:

- Example 1: All the 8s in the input occur in pairs or more horizontally but never vertically. The result only includes 0.
- Example 2: There are some 8s in the input, but they do not always appear as pairs diagonally or vertically. The result only includes 8.
- Example 3: Similar to Example 2, there are some 8s. Here again, the result only includes 8.
- Example 4: In this example, the number 8 appears in various positions, but the final output is 0.
- Example 5: Despite the presence of 8s, the output here is 8.
- Example 6: This has 8s distributed around the grid but the result is 0.

From these examples, there seems to be a pattern that if any 8 appears isolated (not part of a pair either horizontally or vertically), the output changes accordingly. If an isolated 8 is present, the output is [8], otherwise, it's [0].

Applying this logic to the test case:
- There are instances of 8s that are paired horizontally (like in the first row).
- There are no isolated 8s.

Based on this reasoning, the solution for the test case should be [0].

d4469b4b,"The transformation rule seems to be that for every input grid, the output grid displays a 3x3 pattern based on the majority color in the input grid while ignoring any zeros. If there's no clear majority (i.e., an equal number of different non-zero colors), then the central row contains the most frequent non-zero color and the rest of the cells are zero.

In the test case provided, the majority color is 1. Thus, the output grid should contain a 3x3 pattern where the central row is filled with 5 (representing the majority color 1) and the other rows are filled with zeros. The output would look like this:

Analyzing the given examples:

- In Example 1, the numbers in the first three rows got pushed diagonally down-right, while the numbers in the next six rows got pushed diagonally up-right.
- In Example 2, the number '7' is similarly moved in a manner where it goes diagonally down-right, then up-right, and up-left in a zigzag pattern across the grid.
- In Example 3, the same behavior is observed with the number '6'.

The general rule seems to be that numbers are pushed outwards towards the corners of the grid, maintaining their relative positions but moving them diagonally in a specific zigzag pattern - down-right, up-right, and then up-left.

For the given test case, the input grid is:
```
[[3, 3],
 [3, 0],
 [3, 3]]
```

Following the pattern seen in the examples, we need to construct a new grid with dimensions 9x4 that mirrors the input grid's values in a symmetrical pattern across each row:

- Start with the first row `[3, 3]` and mirror it to get `[3, 3, 3, 3]`.
- Second row `[3, 0]` mirrored becomes `[3, 0, 0, 3]`.
- Third row `[3, 3]` mirrored again becomes `[3, 3, 3, 3]`.

This gives us the initial part of our output grid. Then we repeat these rows in reverse order after a row of zeros, maintaining symmetry.

Let's apply this logic and construct the full 9x4 grid:

```
[[3, 3, 3, 3], 
 [3, 0, 0, 3],

27a28665,"From the training examples provided, it seems that there's a pattern where certain configurations of numbers lead to specific single-digit outputs in a 1x1 grid. In particular, whenever the configuration matches some symmetric patterns around a central zero or non-zero element with repeated numbers, a consistent output is generated.

Let’s break down the examples:

- **Example 1**: Input [
  [5, 5, 0],
  [5, 0, 5],
  [0, 5, 0]]
  
  Output: [
  [1]]

- **Example 2**: Input [
  [8, 0, 8],
  [0, 8, 0],
  [8, 0, 8]]
  
  Output: [
  [2]]

- **Example 3**: Input [
  [5, 0, 5],
  [0, 5, 0],
  [5, 0, 5]]
  
  Output: [
  [2]]

- **Example 4**: Input [
  [0, 1, 1],
  [0, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 0]]
  
  Output: [
  [3]]

- **Example 5**: Input [
  [0, 8, 8],
  [0, 8, 8],
  [8, 0, 0]]
  
  Output: [
  [3]]

- **Example 6**: Input [
  [4, 4, 0],
  [4, 0, 4],
  [0, 4, 0]]
  
  Output: [
  [1]]

- **Example 7**: Input [
  [0, 5, 0],
  [5, 5, 5],
  [0, 5, 0]]
  
  Output: [
  [6]]

It appears that the output is determined by the specific arrangement and repetition of numbers within the input grid. Let's look at the symmetry and repetition patterns:

1. The first and sixth examples both use the number `5` with similar arrangements leading to output `1`.
2. The second and third examples both use the number `8` with similar symmetric arrangements leading to output `2`.
3. The fourth and fifth examples show different but still symmetrical arrangements of `1` and `8` leading to output `3`.
4. The seventh example shows an arrangement of `5` with an additional central row of `5`s leading to output `6`.

By analyzing the symmetry and repetition, we see that:

- The first and sixth examples have alternating rows and columns with a 0 in the middle.
- The second and third examples are purely symmetric with a 0 in the middle.
- The fourth and fifth examples have two identical numbers in the corners with the middle cell being 0.
- The seventh example has a central row of the same number surrounded by symmetric patterns with zeros.

For the test case:

Input: [
[0, 8, 0],
[8, 8, 8],
[0, 8, 0]]

The pattern here matches the purely symmetric shape around a central zero, similar to example 2 and 3 but with a different number. Since examples 2 and 3 used `8` and gave an output of `2`, the test case also should give an output of `2` due to the same configuration.

So, the test case solution is:

5614dbcf,"To determine the transformation rule for these examples, let's analyze the inputs and outputs:

In Example 1, the input grid is reduced from a 9x9 matrix to a 3x3 matrix. We can see that the output contains only one instance of every color in each column of the resulting grid. It seems that we're selecting the first non-zero value in each column or the value in the middle row if all rows in a column are zero.

In Example 2, the same pattern occurs: the input grid is transformed to a 3x3 grid by selecting one value per column, likely the first non-zero or the middle row value if there are no non-zeroes.

Applying this transformation rule to the test case:

- In column 1, the first non-zero value is 4.
- In column 2, the first non-zero value is 5.
- In column 3, the first non-zero value is 4.
- In column 4, the first non-zero value is 3.
- In column 5, the first non-zero value is 5 (from the middle row in case of a tie).
- In column 6, the first non-zero value is 3.
- In column 7, the first non-zero value is 5.
- In column 8, the first non-zero value is 5.
- In column 9, the first non-zero value is 0.

Therefore, the output for the test case should be:

[1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
```
Output:
```
[
[2, 2, 0],
[2, 2, 3],
[0, 0, 2]]
```

The pattern here is that the color in the second row, second column remains the same (2), the color in the third row, fourth column remains the same (3), while all other positions not containing these specific colors become 0.

Example 2:
Input:
```
[
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1],

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
```
Output:
```
[
[3, 0, 2],
[3, 0, 2]]
```

Again, the colors specifically mentioned as significant are the ones in the second row, third column (3) and second row, fifth column (2), which are retained, and everything else becomes 0.

Example 3:
Input:
```
[
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1],

[1, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
```
Output:
```
[
[5, 5],
[5, 5],
[6, 6]]
```

In this case, the colors in the third row, second and third columns (5) and third row, fifth column (6) remain in the output.

Following this pattern, for the test input:
Test Input:
```

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],

The relevant colors to retain would be those in specific key positions:
- The color in the third row, fourth column is 2.
- The color in the fourth row, third column is 2.
- The color in the fourth row, fourth column is 3.

673ef223,"To determine the transformation rule applied to convert the input grids into their respective outputs, let's analyze the changes across the different examples provided.

Looking at Example 1:
- The '2' in the third row spreads horizontally to fill the entire row except for the last two cells.
- The '2' in the fourth row interacts with the '8' above it, spreading and merging its value to create a diagonal pattern of '2', '8', and '4'.

In Example 2:
- The '2' in the fifth row spreads horizontally to fill the entire row and merges with the '8's on its right, creating an '8' and '4' in the overlapping positions.
- Below that, the '8' in the sixth row fills its column down, interacting with and merging with the '2' to create an '8' in the seventh row, then filling the rest of the row with '8's.

In Example 3:
- The '2' in the fourteenth row spreads horizontally to fill the entire row, and similarly, the '8' in the tenth row creates a horizontal spread.
- The '2' and '8' interact at the intersection point, leading to the generation of '4' in appropriate places.

Based on these patterns, the rule seems to be:
- Any '2' or '8' in a cell will spread horizontally to the next cell if that cell is '0'.
- If a '2' and an '8' meet horizontally or vertically, they merge into a '4'.

Applying this rule to the Test case:

The '2's and '8's follow the same rules:
- The '2' and '8' in the third and fourth rows create a horizontal and vertical spread, respectively.
- '2' in the third row spreads to the eighth row where it meets the '8', generating a '4'.

31aa019c,"To analyze the transformation rule, let's look closely at the changes in the provided examples.

In Example 1:
- The number 1 turns into 2 along the columns where it appears.
- The number 5 turns into 2 along the columns where it appears.
- The number 8 turns into 2 along the columns where it appears.
- All other numbers become 0.

In Example 2:
- The number 2 turns into 2 along the rows where it appears.
- The number 7 turns into 2 along the rows where it appears.
- The number 9 turns into 2 along the rows where it appears.
- The number 6 stays as 6 along the rows where it appears.
- All other numbers become 0.

In Example 3:

- The number 3 turns into 2 along the diagonals where it appears.
- The number 6 stays as 2 along the diagonals where it appears.
- The number 7 turns into 2 along the diagonals where it appears.
- All other numbers become 0.

Based on these examples:
- In Example 1, the transformation rule seems to focus on columns.
- In Example 2, the transformation rule seems to focus on rows.
- In Example 3, the transformation rule seems to focus on diagonals.

Since the input and output pattern varies across different directions (columns, rows, diagonals), we need to consider if there's a common element for all transformations or if we should apply all the rules.

By observing the patterns more carefully, we notice that the transformation applies only to certain colors (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and they get replaced with 2. However, the rule applied in each example is distinctly column-wise, row-wise, or diagonal-wise. Given no further context about which direction should be prioritized, I will assume that the transformation rule for the test case should be similar to the last example observed, which is diagonal-based.

So, the rule for the test case would be:
- Numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in the diagonal cells will transform into 2.
- Any other number will be transformed into 0.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:

Diagonal positions (starting from top left):
(0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,8), (9,9)

Applying the rule:
- Replace 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 with 2 in diagonal positions.
- Replace any other number with 0 in non-diagonal positions.

7c008303,"The pattern in these examples suggests that we are transforming the input grid into an output grid by keeping only certain numbers and changing others according to specific rules. By analyzing the training examples and the test case, we can deduce that the transformation involves replacing numbers with zeros except for a few specific numbers which have their own rules.

Firstly, the number `8` seems to be replaced by zeros in the output grid if there aren’t other specific numbers surrounding it.

Secondly, the number `3` appears to be transformed into `0`, `2`, or `4` based on what number it directly follows or precedes in the sequence, while maintaining symmetry around `8`.

Lastly, the output's structure seems to be more compact, possibly by removing rows or columns that are entirely zeros or have no specific numbers.

Let's apply these rules to the test case:

Input Grid:
```
[
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
 [3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0],
 [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0],
 [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
 [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
 [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 7]
]
```

Based on the pattern, we replace the `3`s following `8` with `0`, preceding `8` with `2`, and surrounded by `3`s with `4`. `8` itself remains unchanged, but any row or column without relevant transformations becomes zero-filled and might get discarded.

Transformed Grid:
```
[
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]

However, after further refining based on the examples, it looks like we should discard rows/columns that are solely zero, resulting in:

2bcee788,"The transformation rule in these examples seems to involve the following steps:

1. Identify any non-zero value in the grid.
2. Replace all zeros with the most frequent non-zero number that touches them either horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally).
3. For areas where there are multiple numbers touching zeros (horizontally or vertically), the outermost boundary of those areas gets the color of the most frequent number within, while inner cells get the next most frequent number from the original set.

Let's apply the rule to the test case:

**Step-by-step Transformation:**

Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

In the input, we have `1` and `2`. Based on the rules, the `0`s touching `1`s and `2`s change to the most frequent non-zero number among the touching ones. The most frequent numbers here are `1` (three times) and `2` (once).

Thus, we replace all `0`s with `1`, and since the single `2` touches `1`s, its surrounding `0`s should be replaced by `1`,`2`.

Applying this rule:
- All outer `0`s become `1` because `1` is more frequent.
- The inner `0`s around `1` and `2` will also be `1` but the immediate surrounding of `2` will be `2`.
- The cell directly adjacent to `2` will be `1`.

Final grid:
```
[
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],

 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

We see that the most frequent number (`1`) fills out the majority of the grid, and the number `2` influences its closest surroundings.

05269061,"Analyzing the provided examples, we can observe that the transformation rule involves expanding the initial sequence in the top-left corner of each input grid across the entire grid in a repeating pattern. The sequence is read from left to right, starting from the first row, and then repeated in subsequent rows until the grid is filled.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:

[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],
[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]]
```

First, identify the sequence in the top-left corner:
```
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
```

The sequence `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]` is then repeated for all positions in the grid.

Output:
```python
[
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],

cf98881b,"The pattern in the examples seems to involve transforming the input grid into an output grid that's smaller in size and where the color at each position in the output grid appears to be influenced by the color values from the input grid, with a focus on certain patterns of color presence and absence.

Upon close inspection, the resulting output grid contains a reduced width (it's halved) and height (it's also halved), which suggests that the output is derived from combining information across 2x2 blocks of the input grid. Specifically, for any 2x2 block, if there is a '9' present anywhere within that block, then '9' appears in the corresponding cell of the output grid. If there is no '9' but another specific color (like '4' or '2') that persists in the block, that color dominates the output value. In cases where no single color dominates ('4', '2', etc.) and there's no '9', the most common color (most frequent number) in the block or a default color ('0') is chosen.

Let's apply this rule to the test grid:

```
Input Grid:
[
[0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 9, 0, 9, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0],
[4, 4, 0, 4, 2, 9, 9, 9, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0],

[0, 4, 4, 0, 2, 9, 0, 9, 9, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
```

We break this down into 2x2 blocks:
- Block 1: [0, 0, 4, 0] - No dominant color except '0'
- Block 2: [2, 9, 0, 9] - Contains '9', so output is '9'
- Block 3: [0, 2, 0, 2] - Dominated by '0' and '2', but '0' is more frequent
- Block 4: [1, 1, 0, 0] - Dominated by '1'
- Block 5: [0, 0, 4, 4] - Dominated by '4'
- Block 6: [2, 9, 9, 2] - Contains '9', so output is '9'
- Block 7: [1, 1, 1, 1] - Dominated by '1'
- Block 8: [1, 0, 0, 0] - Dominated by '0'

Combining these results we get:

e50d258f,"The transformation rule seems to involve cropping the input grid from its sides, removing any rows or columns that consist entirely of zeros. Then for the remaining grid, if there's any trailing row or column with zeros, they also get removed. The final step appears to be removing all zeros within the core structure of the grid.

Applying this to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[2, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 2, 8, 1, 0],
[1, 2, 8, 1, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 1, 8, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 2, 8, 2, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0],
[0, 8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 2, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

First, we can see that leading and trailing columns on both ends are filled with zeros. After cropping these columns, we have:
```
[
[2, 8, 8, 8],
[8, 8, 1, 8],
[1, 2, 8, 1],
[8, 8, 8, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 2],
[0, 1, 2, 8],
[0, 8, 8, 1],
[0, 1, 2, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```
Next, we remove the trailing column which is made up of zeros and also remove the last fully-zero row:
```
[
[2, 8, 8, 8],
[8, 8, 1, 8],
[1, 2, 8, 1],
[8, 8, 8, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 2],
[0, 1, 2, 8],
[0, 8, 8, 1],
[0, 1, 2, 8]
]
```

Finally, we remove all the zeros within the grid:
```
[
[2, 8, 8, 8],
[8, 8, 1, 8],
[1, 2, 8, 1],
[8, 8, 8, 8],
[8],
[2],
[1, 2, 8],
[8, 8, 1],
[1, 2, 8]
]
```

Since single numbers in their own rows don't make sense in this context and should be merged into larger structures, we combine those rows with adjacent rows where possible. This would yield a more logically structured output:
```
[
[2, 8, 8, 8],
[8, 8, 1, 8],
[1, 2, 8, 1],
[8, 8, 8, 8],
[1, 2, 8, 8],
[8, 8, 1, 2],
[1, 2, 8, 8]
]
```

However, given the format and previous examples, such merging won't be necessary here, as the smallest non-zero blocks are already preserved. Therefore, the final output will be:
Answer: ```[[2, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 8], [1, 2, 8, 1], [8, 8, 8, 8], [8], [2], [0, 1, 2, 8], [0, 8, 8, 1], [0, 1, 2, 8]]``` 

Simplifying the response based on provided examples where isolated numbers do not appear:
Answer: ```[[2, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 8], [1, 2, 8, 1], [8, 8, 8, 8], [1, 2, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 2], [1, 2, 8, 8]]```",,False,False,0.0
ce22a75a,"To understand the transformation rule applied to the examples, let's first analyze the changes:

In Example 1, the number '5' in the middle row and the corresponding '5' in the lower rows have been transformed into a block of '1's that expands to cover the entire column they are in, while leaving other columns unaffected.

In Example 2, the '5's in the second, fifth, and eighth columns have been transformed into blocks of '1's that extend from those columns all the way up to the top, and from where they appear down to the bottom.

Following these patterns, I can deduce that whenever there is a '5' in any position of the grid, it should transform into '1' and spread upwards and downwards in its column until it reaches the edges of the grid.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:

- There's a '5' in the second column of the second row.
- There's an additional '5' directly below it in the eighth column.

Based on this, here's the transformed grid:

caa06a1f,"The pattern from the training examples suggests that for any given input grid, the transformation rule is to swap the two most frequent distinct numbers in each row, while keeping the least frequent number (if there is one) unchanged. Observing all the examples, we see the two alternating numbers switched with each other across every row, whereas the '3's at the end remain the same since they are not part of the alternating sequence.

Applying the same logic to the test case:

- In the second row, the '4's spread left and right.
- In the third row, the '4's spread to the left and right, while the '7' at the end spreads right.
- In the fourth row, the '4's spread further but are limited by the '4's above them on the second row. The '7' spreads to the left.
- In the fifth row, the '7's spread to the left and right.

feca6190,"The pattern in the transformation seems to be that the input array is repeated in a diagonal manner downwards to the right while padding with zeros until the longest possible diagonal sequence for each number in the row is created. The length of the resulting grid is the sum of the original grid's length and the maximum number present in the input grid times 9 plus 1 (since we begin counting from 0).

For the Test case where the input is `[ [0, 6, 7, 8, 9] ]`, the maximum number is 9, so we need 10 rows (5 + 9*1 + 1) and 50 columns (10 * (5+9) - 50).

Let’s apply this process:

1. For each number in the input row, create a new row starting with enough zeros so that the number aligns in its respective column.
2. Continue this pattern diagonally downwards.

e21d9049,"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze how the transformation rules work based on the examples provided:

1. In Example 1, the first three non-zero rows in the input were:
   - [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

   These rows appear in reverse order in the output:
   - [8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2. In Example 2, the first two non-zero rows in the input were:
   - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

   These rows appear in reverse order in the output:
   - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

3. For the middle row that contains multiple non-zero elements, these elements are replicated across the entire row. The specific pattern for replication appears to be repeating the sequence of non-zero elements.

Given this analysis, we can apply the same transformation rules to the test case:

- Identify the first non-zero row(s) and put them at the start of the output in reverse order.
- Identify the middle non-zero row and repeat its elements across the entire row.
- Identify the last non-zero row(s) and put them at the end of the output in reverse order.

First non-zero row from the input: 
``` 
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
Reverse order: 
```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Middle non-zero row: 
```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
Repeat across the row: 
```
[4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1]
```

Last non-zero row:
```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
Reverse order: 
```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]

6e02f1e3,"To solve the problem, let's first identify the pattern from the training examples:

- In Example 1, the input grid contains only the number 2 and 3. The output grid has 5 at positions that were initially 2 and 0 at positions that were 3.
- In Example 2, the pattern is similar but involves a different arrangement and also includes number 4. The output grid has 5 where there was a 3 and alternates between 0 and 5 where there was a 4 or 2.
- In Example 3 and 4, the input is entirely filled with either 4 or 3. The output places 5 in the rows where the input had 4 and moves it cyclically to other rows for 3.
- Example 5 shows a mixed scenario where the rows with 4 get 5s, and 3 gets 0s, while 2 remains unchanged.

Based on these observations, here is what seems to be happening in the transformation rule:
- Any occurrence of '3' in the input grid is transformed into '5' in the output.
- Any occurrence of '4' in the input grid is transformed into '5', and if 4 is followed by another 4 in the same row, then a zero is placed after the first 5.
- If '2' is present in the input grid alone or with '3' in the same row, '2' is replaced by '0'.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

Test Case:
Input: 
```
[
[4, 4, 4],
[2, 3, 2],
[3, 2, 3]]

Following the identified rules:
- First row [4, 4, 4] should become [5, 0, 0]
- Second row [2, 3, 2] should become [0, 5, 0]
- Third row [3, 2, 3] should become [5, 0, 5]

So, the output grid should be:

For the second input, the central section is rows 2 through 7 and columns 4 through 9. The output also takes the middle three columns (columns 4, 5, and 6) of these rows.

Applying the same rule to the test case:

62c24649,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the grids in the examples, let's analyze how the input grids are transformed into their respective outputs.

In all three training examples, we observe that the transformation involves mirroring the grid along its vertical axis and then appending the mirrored version to the right of the original grid. This effectively doubles the width of the grid while maintaining its height, and the content of the mirrored part exactly matches the original content.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input Grid:
```
[
[1, 1, 0],
[0, 3, 2],
[3, 3, 0]]
```

Mirrored Part:
```
[
[0, 1, 1],
[2, 3, 0],
[0, 3, 3]]
```

Now combining the two parts, we get the output grid:
```
[
[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0],
[3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3]]
```

Since the mirrored part duplicates the columns in reverse order, and considering that each row should have the same number of columns and rows, we add duplicate rows below corresponding to the original ones. Thus, the correct output is:

Output Grid:
``` 
[
[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0],
[3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3],
[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0],

1fad071e,"To solve the puzzle, let's analyze the pattern in the provided examples.

Looking at the first example, the grid contains patterns with `0` and `2`. The output seems to contain `1` where `0` and `2` are present in certain rows or columns. It appears that a `1` is generated for every column where at least one `0` or `2` is found, but if there are only `1`s in that column, it remains all `0`.

Let's try to apply this rule to the second and third examples to verify consistency.
- In the second example, we see `1`, `0`, and `2`. The output includes `1`s where both `1` and either `0` or `2` are present, but not fully composed of `1`s.
- Similarly, the third example also confirms the rule that `1` is generated wherever `0` or `2` appear in a column, unless all elements are `1`.

We can now apply this rule to the test case:
- We need to check each column for the presence of `0` and `2`.
- If any column has at least one `0` or `2`, then that column in the output should have `1` for all its rows.
- If a column has no `0` or `2`, then it should remain all zeros.

a8c38be5,"To figure out the transformation rule from the input grid to the output grid, we need to closely examine how the integer values in the input correspond to those in the output.

From the provided examples, it appears that the transformation involves cropping the initial grid to a smaller one without empty spaces on the sides and then performing some kind of value transformation. However, there seems to be no straightforward pattern with the actual numbers (like incrementing, decrementing, replacing, etc.). Instead, the transformation seems to involve reassigning numbers based on their position relative to the new smaller grid's dimensions, but the specific reassignment of values (like changing from `5` to `6`, etc.) isn't consistent across examples. 

A closer look at the structure suggests that the transformation may be related to:

1. Removing rows and columns filled entirely with zeros.
2. Reassigning existing numbers to fit the remaining structure while keeping adjacent patterns or values intact.

In the absence of a clear numerical value transformation rule, let's focus on the structural transformation:

- The input grid has some rows and columns which are filled entirely with zeros and are not present in the output grid.
- After removing such rows and columns, the remaining structure is preserved in terms of relative positions of the non-zero elements, but the specific values (colors) appear to reorganize in a pattern dependent on their initial relative position and adjacency within the input grid.

Given the test case, let's follow these steps:

1. Remove all rows and columns where every element is zero.
2. For remaining cells, observe their adjacency properties and try to map them to a new set of values accordingly.

Let's remove the completely zero-filled rows and columns from the test grid:

f9012d9b,"To find the pattern or transformation rule from the given inputs to their respective outputs, let's analyze the examples step-by-step:

### Example 1:
Input:
```
[
 [2, 1, 2, 1, 2],
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 [2, 1, 2, 1, 2],
 [0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 2, 1, 2]
]
```

Output:
```
[
 [1, 1],
 [2, 1]
]
```

### Example 2:
Input:
```
[
 [8, 6, 0, 6],
 [6, 8, 6, 8],
 [8, 6, 8, 6],
 [6, 8, 6, 8]
]
```

Output:
```
[

```

### Example 3:
Input:
```
[
 [2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2],
 [2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2],
 [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
 [2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2],
 [2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2],
 [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Output:
```
[
 [5, 5],
 [5, 2]
]
```

After analyzing these transformations, we observe that the output in each case seems to be derived by finding the unique colors and then determining the most frequent color in each pair of rows horizontally, while ignoring zeros.

### Proposed Rule:
1. Remove all zeros from the input.
2. Find the most common color in each horizontal pair of rows, while considering only the non-zero elements.

### Applying to Test Case
Input:
```

 [8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8],
 [8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8]
]
```

Let's remove zeros and count non-zero elements in pairs:
- Rows 1 and 2: `8, 1, 8, 8` vs `1, 8, 8, 1`  
  Common colors: `8` and `1` both appear twice - choose first one that appears, i.e., `8`.
- Rows 3 and 4: `8, 8, 1, 8` vs `8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8` 
  Common colors: `8` appears thrice in row 4, so choose `8`.
- Rows 5 and 6: `1, 8, 8, 1, 8` vs `8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1`  
  Common colors: `8` appears five times, `1` appears twice - choose `8`.
- Rows 7 and 8: `8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8` vs `8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8`
  Common colors: `8` appears seven times, `1` appears twice - choose `8`.

Therefore, the transformed output should be:

Applying this rule to the test case:

- All zeros remain unchanged.
- In the second row, all `8`s move up to the first row.
- In the third row, the `8`s move up to the second row.
- The `8` in the seventh row moves up to the sixth row.
- The `8` in the eighth row moves up to the seventh row.
- The `8` in the ninth row moves up to the eighth row.

Test case input:
```

[1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
[1, 0, 1, 5, 0, 1, 0]
]
```

By applying the rule:

- The first row contains both '1' and '5', so '1's should be changed to '2's.
- The second row contains both '1' and '5', so '1's here should be changed to '2's.
- The third row contains both '1' and '5', so '1's here should be changed to '2's.
- Checking columns, we see that the first, third, fourth, sixth, and seventh columns have at least one '1' and one '5'.

Thus, following this pattern, the '1's in these positions should be turned to '2's, and every other number should become '0'.

47c1f68c,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the grids in the examples, let's analyze the given transformations:

- In Example 1, the color `1` was transformed into `0`, and the background `0` was transformed into `2`.
- In Example 2, the color `3` was transformed into `8`, and the background `0` was transformed into `0` except for the areas affected by `8`.
- In Example 3, the color `2` was transformed into `4` and `0` was transformed into `0` except for the areas affected by `4`.

From these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule flips the roles of two specific numbers within the grid, where the second number is spread across the entire grid in its unchanged form.

For the Test Case, the numbers `8` and `3` seem to follow such a pattern where `8` would transform into `3`, and `3` would transform into `8`. However, the most significant change is the background `0` transforming based on the spread of another number. Here, the number `3` is spread across the entire grid, so the background `0` should transform into `3` and vice versa.

Applying this transformation rule, we get:

d89b689b,"The transformation rule seems to involve swapping non-zero elements across rows such that they move from their original positions into the center row of the grid (row 4), with each pair of swapped elements coming from opposite ends of the grid. If there are two non-zero elements in the same column but not in the center row, these are then placed into the center row in the order they appear from top to bottom. After placing all pairs into the center row, other rows become zero-filled except for the center row.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- Row 1 has a 0 in position 7, which gets swapped with the 4 from row 2.
- Row 9 has a 7 which gets swapped with the 0 from row 10.
- Row 2 has a 4 which was already swapped.
- Rows 3 through 8 remain all zeros since they have no non-zero elements.
- Rows 4 and 5 have non-zero elements in columns 5 and 6. These get moved to the center row in the order that they appear, thus moving the 8s from rows 4 and 5 to row 4, and the 8s from rows 6 and 7 to row 4 as well.

d5d6de2d,"The transformation rule appears to involve replacing groups of adjacent 2's in a row or column with a block of 3's that span all rows or columns where the group was present. The size of the new block of 3's is determined by the height or width of the initial group of 2's, whichever is applicable.

For example, if a column has three consecutive values of 2, then a single vertical column of 3's is placed there. If a row has three consecutive values of 2, then a horizontal row of 3's is placed there. It seems only one longest continuous group per row or column is considered for transformation.

Applying this rule to the provided test case:

- First column: 2's appear consecutively from row 0 to 2, and also from row 4 to 9. However, the group from row 4 to 9 is larger, so we transform the entire first column with 3's.
- Second column: No transformation needed because there are no more than two consecutive 2's.
- Third column: 2's appear consecutively from row 0 to 2, so we transform from row 3 to the bottom of that column.
- Fourth column: Transformation not needed due to just one 2.
- Fifth to ninth columns: Transformation not needed since they don't contain more than two consecutive 2's.
- Tenth column: 2's appear consecutively from row 0 to 2, so we transform those rows of the tenth column.

However, since the required format involves a list of lists where each inner list consists of three elements, and if there are fewer than three elements, they should be padded with zeros, the correct answer should be:

d23f8c26,"The pattern in the provided examples seems to involve zeroing out all numbers except those on the main diagonal, however, there's another common pattern that zeros out numbers except the ones forming a continuous straight line horizontally or vertically across the grid. Given the nature of how some numbers are retained in various rows and columns, but not in isolation, and observing the examples closely, it appears that the rule applied here is to keep only the numbers that form the longest uninterrupted horizontal or vertical sequence, and setting to 0 all other numbers.

In the test case below:
```
[
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7],
[8, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 3],
[0, 7, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0]]
```

- In the first row, there are two sequences [3] and [7], and since neither is the longest, they both get set to 0.
- In the second row, the sequence [8, 1, 8] gets broken into [8], [1], and [8]. Since 8 appears twice, the topmost and bottommost instances get retained while everything else in the row becomes 0.
- In the third row, there are three sequences [3], [8], and [3], none of which are uninterrupted across the entire row, so all numbers except the first [3] are set to 0.
- In the fourth row, the sequence [7, 1, 7] breaks into [7] and [1], so these become the only retained numbers, with the rest being set to 0.
- The fifth row has no numbers, so it remains unchanged.
- In the sixth row, there is one uninterrupted sequence [1, 6, 8, 6], so these numbers are retained and the rest are set to 0.
- In the seventh row, the uninterrupted sequences are [8] and [6], and since they don't span the whole row, we retain just [8, 6].

Putting the rule into practice for the test case:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]]
```

However, since the rule is to retain the longest continuous horizontal or vertical sequence and there are no such uninterrupted sequences spanning across any row or column entirely, every number outside of what forms the longest (or tied longest) continuous line in a row and column should be set to 0. So we need to look at each row and column for the longest continuous sequence and keep only those:

For the test case, let’s apply the rule correctly:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],

- In Example 1, the rule seems to involve spreading out certain numbers (especially 1 and 2) diagonally from their original positions.
- In Example 2, the rule also involves spreading out certain numbers (especially 1 and 2) diagonally, and filling in some zeroes with 2s when these are adjacent to a 2 above or below them.

Applying the same rules to the Test Case, I'll spread out the numbers accordingly:

**Example 1:**
Input:
```
[
[0, 2, 0, 0, 2],
[2, 2, 0, 2, 2],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 2, 0, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 0, 2, 0]
]
```

Output:
```
[

```

**Example 2:**
Input:
```
[
[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
]
```

Output:
```
[
[1, 0],
[1, 1]
]
```

**Example 3:**
Input:
```
[
[8, 8, 0, 0, 8],
[8, 0, 0, 8, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
[8, 0, 0, 0, 5]
]
```

Output:
```
[
[0, 8],
[8, 0]
]
```

Observations:
- In Example 1, the result is two rows where the first row contains the values from the first and second columns of the input, and the second row contains the values from the fourth and fifth columns.
- In Example 2, the same pattern holds - the first row of the output consists of the first and second columns of the input, and the second row consists of the fourth and fifth columns.
- In Example 3, despite the presence of a new number (5) which isn't part of the previous column pattern, we still see the first and second columns along with the fourth and fifth columns transformed into the two rows.

Based on these examples, I'll apply the same extraction of first two and last two columns to the test case:

**Test Case:**
Input:
```
[
[5, 5, 0, 5, 0],
[0, 5, 0, 0, 5],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
[0, 5, 0, 0, 5]
]
```

Applying the rule:
First row of output: First two columns `[5, 5]` and `[0, 5]`
Second row of output: Fourth and fifth columns `[5, 0]` and `[5, 5]`

So, the answer should be:

For Example 1, the number 2 is used and placed in an alternating pattern with 5 from left to right in each row.
For Example 2, the number 3 is used and placed in an alternating pattern with 5.
For Example 3, the number 4 is used and similarly alternated.

This change happens when the '2' is not at the edge of the block of '2's. Let's apply this rule to the Test Case.

Applying the rule to the Test Case:

- In the second row, there's a single '2' surrounded on each side by another '2' and zeros, so it changes to a '1'.
- In the third and fourth rows, the central '2' in the horizontal line surrounded by '2's changes to '1'.
- In the fifth and sixth rows, there's a vertical pattern where the middle '2' changes to '1'.
- In the seventh row, the central '2' surrounded on each side by another '2' and zeros will change.
- And finally, in the eighth row, the central '2' surrounded by other '2's also changes to '1'.

However, the exact transformation rule from the provided examples appears to involve moving specific rows to the top of the grid rather than a direct mirror. Let's look at the patterns closely:

- In Example 1, the two rows at the bottom become the two rows at the top.
- In Example 2, the single row at the bottom becomes the single row at the top.

Applying the same logic to the test case, we need to move the bottom rows to the top of the grid while keeping the existing order. Since there are five empty rows at the bottom, the bottom three rows should move to the top three rows.

In the test case provided:
- The largest continuous colored area from the top left corner is composed of the number 4 which starts in the second row and spans two rows and two columns.
- Thereafter, the area with number 3 is examined, but it does not start from the top left like the 4s do.
- Finally, the area starting from the top left is the color 5 which starts in the 8th row and 2nd column, spanning three columns and one row.

However, since the rule is to consider the largest continuous colored area from the top-left corner:
- The largest continuous area from the top-left corner is the group of 4's starting in the second row.

Therefore, the output should be a rectangle representing just the 4's:
Answer: ```[[4, 4], [0, 4]]``` 

Notice here we only include the first instance of the largest continuous area from the top left corner (ignoring subsequent repetitions unless they extend that initial shape), resulting in a grid that captures the 4's as a rectangle without any interruption by zeros within the block of 4s.

Following the examples, we replace adjacent 4s with 5s and remove all 4s from the grid. Here's the output based on that rule:

It seems that I misinterpreted the rule in my response. Correcting this based on the accurate observation from the examples provided, the actual process involves expanding the area of color 5 when a 4 is adjacent to it and replacing any 4 that is adjacent to 5 with 5, thus spreading the color 5 around the 4s and eliminating them. Applying this correct rule to the test case would yield the following output:

2204b7a8,"The transformation rule applied to the training examples seems to change all instances of '3' to the color of the first non-zero value in the row (from left to right) if there is one, and to the color of the last non-zero value in the row (from right to left) if there are no non-zero values to the left of '3'. If the '3' is the only non-zero value in the row, it remains unchanged.

Using this rule on the test case:

- In the second row, the '3's are changed to '4'.
- In the third, fifth, seventh, and ninth rows, the '3's remain unchanged since they are surrounded by zeros.
- In the fourth row, the '3' is changed to '5'.
- In the sixth row, the '3' is changed to '5'.
- In the eighth row, the '3' is changed to '4'.

This is done for all occurrences of '8' in the grid.

So, the rule can be described as: For every '8', if an adjacent cell is '0', change that cell to '1'.

3de23699,"Analyzing the provided examples, we can see that the transformation rule involves identifying distinct non-zero color clusters within the provided grid and then generating a smaller grid that represents these clusters:

1. In Example 1, all '4's and '2's form separate clusters which are collapsed into a smaller grid.
2. In Example 2, '3's and '2's form clusters, and they have been similarly collapsed into a smaller output grid.
3. In Example 3, '6's and '8's are the non-zero elements forming their respective clusters.
4. In Example 4, '2's and '3's are identified, and each cluster is represented in the output.

In each case, the output retains only the non-zero numbers and reduces the size of the grid to accommodate only the identified clusters.

For the Test Case:
- We have two types of non-zero clusters: '2's and '3's.
- All '2's form two distinct clusters on opposite sides of the grid.
- All '3's form a cluster spanning the middle region.

We need to collapse these clusters into the smallest possible grid while preserving the color information.

The resulting grid:
- Should include '2' in the first and last columns.
- Should include '3' in the middle columns.

0d3d703e,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the test case, we should first observe the pattern in the provided examples.

- In Example 1, the transformation rule appears to be adding 1 to each element.
- In Example 2, the numbers do not follow the simple addition rule from Example 1.
- In Example 3, similarly, the numbers do not simply follow an addition rule.
- In Example 4, again, the numbers do not seem to follow a simple arithmetic rule.

Given these observations, let's analyze the patterns:

Example 1:
Input: [3, 1, 2] transforms to [4, 5, 6]. 
3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6

Example 2:
Input: [2, 3, 8] transforms to [6, 4, 9].
2 -> 6, 3 -> 4, 8 -> 9

Example 3:
Input: [5, 8, 6] transforms to [1, 9, 2].
5 -> 1, 8 -> 9, 6 -> 2

Example 4:
Input: [9, 4, 2] transforms to [8, 3, 6].
9 -> 8, 4 -> 3, 2 -> 6

By examining these transformations closely, we notice that the second transformation does not simply add or subtract a fixed value; rather, each number seems to map to another specific number.
Upon closer inspection, the rule appears to involve cycling through a sequence of mappings: 

3 -> 4
1 -> 5
2 -> 6
5 -> 1
8 -> 9
6 -> 2
9 -> 8
4 -> 3
2 -> 6 (seen again)

Since there's no consistent arithmetic operation but repeated mappings, we can deduce that this is a specific color mapping or substitution. From the given examples, we can infer the following mappings:
- 3 maps to 4
- 1 maps to 5
- 2 maps to 6
- 5 maps to 1
- 8 maps to 9
- 6 maps to 2
- 9 maps to 8
- 4 maps to 3

Applying this mapping rule to the test case:
- 8 maps to 3
- 1 maps to 5
- 3 maps to 4

So, the test case transforms as follows:
```
[
[8, 1, 3],
[8, 1, 3],
[8, 1, 3]]
```

```
[
[3, 5, 4],

a9f96cdd,"Upon analyzing the provided examples, it appears that when there's a '2' in the input, the transformation rule involves creating a sequence of three numbers around that '2', changing the original layout:

- In Example 1, we have a '2' in the second row, second column. This results in a '3', '0', '6' sequence above it and an '8', '0', '7' sequence below it.
- In Example 2, we have a '2' in the third row, fifth column. This leads to replacing the fourth column with '3' and '8', and the fifth column with '0' and '7' in the second row.
- In Example 3, a '2' in the second row, third column results in '8', '0', '7' in the second row after the '2', and '0', '3', '6' in the first row before the '2'.
- In Example 4, similar to Example 3, but the sequence wraps to the next line because the space is insufficient in the same row.

The pattern seems to be that '2' triggers a sequence of [3, 0, 6] being placed immediately before the '2', and [8, 0, 7] placed immediately after the '2'. If the space is not enough in its own row, the sequence continues in the following row.

5bd6f4ac,"To deduce the transformation rule based on the provided examples, let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

From the training examples, we can observe that the output grids are a subset of the input grids. Specifically, they seem to consist only of the last three columns of the corresponding input grid. 

Let's apply this analysis to each of the examples:

- Example 1: The input grid's last three columns are `[9, 7, 0]`, `[4, 8, 4]`, and `[4, 0, 0]`. These are exactly the values in the output grid.

- Example 2: The input grid's last three columns are `[0, 6, 0]`, `[0, 8, 1]`, and `[4, 4, 5]`. Again, these match the output grid.

Following this pattern, the transformation rule appears to be extracting the last three columns from the original grid.

Now let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input Test Case:

- The '2' in row 1, column 3 moves into the second row's second column in the output.
- The '6' in row 1, column 6 appears in the third row's first column in the output.
- The '6' in row 5, column 10 appears in the sixth row's ninth column in the output.
- The '4' in row 6, col 4 appears in the seventh row's tenth column in the output.

In the second and third examples, similar patterns are observed where any non-zero value in the input grid propagates downwards and rightwards to fill the diagonal cells in the output grid.

Applying the same logic to the Test Case:

Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 9],
[7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Let’s apply the transformation rule to generate the output grid:
- '3' in row 1, column 7 appears in row 8, column 1 in the output grid.
- '9' in row 1, column 10 appears in row 9, column 2 in the output grid.
- '7' in row 2, column 1 appears in row 2, column 1 in the output grid.
- '3' in row 4, column 4 appears in row 9, column 3 in the output grid.
- '9' in row 4, column 7 appears in row 9, column 6 in the output grid.
- '6' in row 5, column 4 appears in row 7, column 4 in the output grid.
- '4' in row 6, column 10 appears in row 7, column 9 in the output grid.
- '7' in row 8, column 7 appears in row 8, column 7 in the output grid.
- '4' in row 10, column 6 appears in row 10, column 6 in the output grid.

Therefore, the output grid for the test case would be:

56ff96f3,"The transformation rule in each example seems to involve spreading out the integer values horizontally across the rows until they hit a boundary or another non-zero value. Let's apply this rule to the test case.

Starting with the original input:
```
[
[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

For each non-zero value, we spread them left and right until they hit a boundary or another non-zero value. So, for example, the `8` in the first row spreads to the right, filling the entire row except the boundary. Then the `8` in the second row also spreads to the left and right, overlapping with the first row's spread area but creating a continuous filled region. For the `6`, it spreads left and right in its respective rows.

Applying this, here's the output:

d10ecb37,"The transformation rule from the provided examples seems to involve finding unique pairs in each row of the input grid and then listing those pairs in the output grid, one pair per row, sorted in the order they first appear.

For the test case:
- The first row is `[9, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 9]`. The unique pairs are `[9, 6]`, `[6, 2]`.
- The second row is `[2, 9, 9, 6, 6, 9, 9, 2]`. The unique pairs are `[2, 9]`, `[9, 6]`.
- The third row is `[6, 9, 9, 2, 2, 9, 9, 6]`. The unique pairs are `[6, 9]`, `[9, 2]`.
- The fourth row is `[9, 2, 6, 9, 9, 6, 2, 9]`. The unique pairs are `[9, 2]`, `[2, 6]`.

Following the rule of taking only the first unique pair encountered, we get:

Answer: ```[[9, 6], [2, 9]]```

Upon closer examination, the rule might actually be to identify just the first two distinct numbers in each row, without pairing them further. Let's re-evaluate based on that rule.
- First row has `9` and `6` as the first two distinct numbers.
- Second row has `2` and `9` as the first two distinct numbers.
- Third row has `6` and `9` as the first two distinct numbers.
- Fourth row has `9` and `2` as the first two distinct numbers.

Therefore, the correct answer should be:

c9f8e694,"The transformation seems to involve changing any block of identical numbers that touch each other horizontally or vertically to a new pattern where the numbers repeat themselves with a shift in their occurrence. Looking at the examples, we see that when we have a group of five '5's in a row, they transform into a group of two '5's followed by three '0's, repeated until all spots of the group are filled.

We can apply the same transformation to the test case:
- Transform all groups of '5's similarly.
- Groups of '1's transform into a single '1' followed by a '0', then another '1', alternating.
- Groups of '8's transform into a single '8' followed by a '0', then another '8', alternating.
- Groups of '7's transform into a single '7' followed by a '0', then another '7', alternating.
- And so on for any other number which appears in a contiguous block.

b2862040,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the outputs, let's carefully examine the patterns in the provided examples:

In the first example, all the '1' values that are not on the edge of the grid and surrounded only by '1' or '9' values from at least two sides get changed to '8'. The surrounding condition seems to be that if a '1' value has at least two sides (up, down, left, right) bounded by either '9' or another '1', then it gets replaced with '8'.

In the second example, again, the same pattern applies; all '1' values that meet the surrounding condition become '8'.

In the third example, we see the similar transformation where certain '1' values are converted into '8' when they have at least two sides surrounded by '9' or '1'.

The fourth example also follows this rule - specific '1' values that meet the surrounding criteria are transformed into '8'.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:
- Change a cell that contains a '1' to an '8' if it is completely enclosed by '9's or other '1's such that there are at least two adjacent sides ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right') blocked by '9's or '1's.

Applying this transformation rule to the test case grid:

1. Start with the top row: All '1' values are along the boundary and do not get replaced.
2. Continue through the rows checking for cells that meet the rule (enclosed by '9' or '1' on at least two sides).
  
By analyzing the test case grid, the cells that get replaced according to the rule are:
- Row 3, Column 4
- Row 3, Column 5
- Row 3, Column 6
- Row 4, Column 4
- Row 4, Column 5
- Row 4, Column 6
- Row 5, Column 4

8e5a5113,"To find the pattern in how these transformations occur, let's analyze the provided training examples.

Upon careful observation, it appears that the transformation rule involves expanding zeros in the grid with specific patterns. The specific pattern chosen depends on the color (number) immediately adjacent to the zero from the left.

Let's break down how the rule works:

For every column where there is a sequence of zeroes after a non-zero color, each zero gets replaced by a set of numbers corresponding to the sequence of unique colors (excluding the zero) from the previous columns, starting from the rightmost column.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case:
Input:
```
[
[3, 3, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[9, 9, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[2, 9, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Following the rule, we replace each zero with the pattern determined by the non-zero number to the left of the first zero in the sequence followed by the remaining non-zero elements from the same row in reverse order.

Replacing the zeros in the first row:
- First zero after the first 5: Replace with [5, 9, 3] from the left side.
- Next two zeros: Follow the same pattern [5, 9, 3].

First row becomes:
`[3, 3, 9, 5, 5, 9, 3, 5, 3, 9, 5]`.

Second row becomes:
`[9, 9, 9, 5, 5, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 5]`.

Third row becomes:
`[2, 9, 9, 5, 5, 9, 2, 5, 2, 9, 9]`.

Therefore, the output for the test case should be:
```python
[
[3, 3, 9, 5, 5, 9, 3, 5, 3, 9, 5],

```
Output:
```

Observation: The first row has a swap between columns 1 and 2. Rows 2 and 3 have swaps between columns 1 and 3.

2. Example 2:

```
[

```
Observation: The first row has a swap between columns 1 and 2. Rows 2 and 3 have swaps between columns 2 and 3.

3. Example 3:

Observation: The first row has a swap between columns 1 and 3.

4. Example 4:

```
Output:
```

 [6, 2, 6]]
```
Observation: The first row has a swap between columns 2 and 3. Rows 2 and 3 have swaps between columns 1 and 2.

From these observations, a pattern emerges that the transformation involves swapping elements across the diagonal running from the top left to bottom right.

Given the test case:

Input:
```
[
 [9, 3, 4],
 [9, 4, 4],
 [9, 3, 4]]
```

Transforming it based on the identified rule:
- Swap elements across the diagonal.
- So, `9` with `3`, `3` with `4`, and `4` with `9`.

Thus, the resulting transformed grid is:
```
[
 [9, 4, 3],
 [4, 4, 9],
 [3, 9, 4]]
```

Therefore, the answer for the test case is:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]```

Columns 1 and 7 have a non-zero number (3 and 9) in the first row respectively, so all the zeros in these two columns of subsequent rows should be replaced with the corresponding non-zero number from the first row.

Applying this rule, we get:

b91ae062,"From the examples provided, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves expanding the grid while replicating each color across a larger space, maintaining their original positions. In each example, the output grid is made larger in both dimensions compared to the input grid, with every non-zero color repeated in a pattern that extends its presence across the new space.

Looking closer:
- Example 1 input size is 3x3 → the output is 6x6.
- Example 2 input size is 3x3 → the output is 6x6.
- Example 3 input size is 3x3 → the output is 9x9.
- Example 4 input size is 3x3 → the output is 9x9.
- Example 5 input size is 3x4 → the output is 12x12.

The rule seems to be:
- If the input grid has dimensions NxM, the output grid becomes 2Nx2M.
- Each non-zero value in the input grid is duplicated horizontally and vertically in the output grid to fill the corresponding 2x2 blocks in the output grid.

With this understanding, let's apply the rule to the test case.
