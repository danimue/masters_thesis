75b8110e,"To understand the transformation, I need to analyze the provided examples:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - In all examples, the output grid is a 4x4 grid.
   - The output grid seems to be a selection of specific elements from the input grid.

2. **Positioning**:
   - The elements in the output grid appear to be selected from the middle of the input grid.
   - Specifically, the output grid appears to be composed of elements from the 3rd to 6th rows and columns of the input grid.

3. **Verification**:
   - Example 1: The 4x4 subgrid starting at row 3, column 3 matches the output.
   - Example 2: The 4x4 subgrid starting at row 3, column 3 matches the output.
   - Example 3: The 4x4 subgrid starting at row 3, column 3 matches the output.
   - Example 4: The 4x4 subgrid starting at row 3, column 3 matches the output.
   - Example 5: The 4x4 subgrid starting at row 3, column 3 matches the output.

Given this pattern, I will apply the same transformation to the test case.

### Test Case Transformation

[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9],
[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]]
```

Extract the 4x4 subgrid starting at row 3, column 3:

- **Example 1**:
    - Input: The number `1` is in the center of the third row, and a `5` appears below it.
    - Output: The `1` moves to the center of the bottom row, replacing one of the `5`s.

- **Example 2**:
    - Input: There are two `1`s in the third row and two `5`s in the fourth row.
    - Output: The `1`s move to the bottom row, replacing the corresponding `5`s.

- **Example 3**:
    - Input: There are two `1`s in the third row and two `5`s in the fourth row, but they are not aligned.
    - Output: The `1`s move to the bottom row, replacing the corresponding `5`s.

From these observations, the rule seems to be: 
- All `1`s in the third row move to the bottom row, replacing the corresponding `5`s.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

### Test Case
- **Input**:
  ```
  [

  [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 5, 0, 5],
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]
  ```

- **Transformation**:
  - The `1`s in the third row (positions `[2][2]` and `[2][4]`) will move to the bottom row (positions `[4][2]` and `[4][4]`), replacing the `5`s.

- **Output**:
  ```

3ac3eb23,"The pattern in the provided examples suggests that non-zero values are copied down and mirrored every two rows. To clarify:

- In Example 1, the numbers 2 and 8 in the first row are repeated in every even-indexed row (1, 3, 5) in the same positions and also mirrored in the positions adjacent to them.
- Similarly, in Example 2, the number 4 in the first row is repeated in every even-indexed row (1, 3, 5) in the same positions and also mirrored in the positions adjacent to them.

Following this pattern, we can apply the same transformation to the test case:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: A block of 8s surrounded by 3s, with 0s around the edges.
   - Output: The 8s in the middle are replaced by 3s, making the entire row of 3s consistent.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: A block of 6s surrounded by 1s, with 0s around the edges.
   - Output: The 6s in the middle are replaced by 1s, making the entire row of 1s consistent.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: A block of 1s surrounded by 7s, with 0s around the edges.
   - Output: The 1s in the middle are replaced by 7s, making the entire row of 7s consistent.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: A block of 3s surrounded by 2s, with 0s around the edges.
   - Output: The 3s in the middle are replaced by 2s, making the entire row of 2s consistent.

From these examples, we can generalize the transformation rule:
- Identify the rows where there is a block of one color surrounded by another color.
- Replace the inner block with the surrounding color, making the entire row consistent with the surrounding color.

1. **Identify the Inner Grid**: The inner grid is the part of the input grid that contains non-zero values, excluding the outermost zeros.
2. **Add the Border**: Add a border of `4` around the identified inner grid.

### Inner Grid
The inner grid, excluding the outer zeros, is:

[8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],
[8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]
]
```

### Adding the Border
Adding a border of `4` around the inner grid:
```
[

The output grid is twice as wide and twice as tall as the input grid. Each cell in the input grid is repeated in a 2x2 block in the output grid. Additionally, cells with value 0 in the input grid are replaced by alternating 8s and 0s in the output grid.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input:**

  [0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0],
  [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]]
  ```

This example further confirms the pattern. The grid is expanded by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, and zeros are replaced by alternating 8s and 0s.

### Example 4 Analysis:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0],

d9f24cd1,"To solve the test case, let's analyze the transformations applied in the provided examples:

1. **Pattern of Filling with 2s**: 
    - In both examples, the entire grid is filled with `2`s except where there are already non-zero values.
    - This suggests that all empty cells (cells with `0`) are replaced with `2`.

2. **Preservation of Non-zero Values**:
    - The non-zero values (like `5` and `2`) in the input are preserved in their respective positions in the output.

3. **Consistency**:
    - The pattern of filling with `2`s and preserving non-zero values is consistent across both examples.

Given these observations, we can apply the same transformation to the test case:

- Replace all `0`s with `2`s.
- Preserve all non-zero values in their original positions.

Let's apply this to the test case:

```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
]
```

After applying the transformation:

```python
[
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],

[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
]
```

However, we need to preserve the non-zero values in their original positions:

```python

67a423a3,"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the transformation rules based on the given examples:

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - In all examples, the number 4 appears in areas that are not part of the original shapes.
   - The number 4 seems to surround the shapes that are formed by other numbers.

2. **Transformation Rule:**
   - For each shape (a contiguous group of the same number), add a border of 4s around it, except where it already touches the edge of the grid or another shape.

3. **Apply the Rule to the Test Case:**

   - The test case has a vertical line of 5s and a horizontal line of 3s.
   - We need to add a border of 4s around these shapes, ensuring that the borders do not overlap and do not extend beyond the grid edges.

Let's apply this rule step by step:

- The vertical line of 5s will have 4s added to its left and right sides.
- The horizontal line of 3s will have 4s added above and below it.

Here is the transformed grid:

5582e5ca,"To solve this problem, let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided examples:

### Example 1:
- **Input:** 
  ```
  [
  [4, 4, 8],
  [6, 4, 3],
  [6, 3, 0]
  ]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [
  [4, 4, 4],
  [4, 4, 4],
  [4, 4, 4]
  ]
  ```

In this example, all elements in the output grid are 4, which is one of the values present in the input grid.

### Example 2:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [6, 8, 9],
  [1, 8, 1],
  [9, 4, 9]
  ]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [

  [9, 9, 9],
  [9, 9, 9]

  ```

Here, all elements in the output grid are 9, which is the maximum value in the input grid.

### Example 3:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [4, 6, 9],

- **Output:**
  ```
  [

  ```

In this example, all elements in the output grid are 6, which is the most frequent value in the input grid.

### General Rule:
The transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify the most frequent value in the input grid.
- If there is a tie for the most frequent value, choose the maximum value among the tied values.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [8, 8, 6],
  [4, 6, 9],
  [8, 3, 0]

Let's count the frequency of each value:
- 8 appears 3 times
- 6 appears 2 times
- 4 appears 1 time
- 9 appears 1 time
- 3 appears 1 time
- 0 appears 1 time

The most frequent value is 8. Therefore, the output grid will be filled with 8s.

234bbc79,"To solve this, I will analyze the transformation rules applied in the provided training examples:

1. **Removal of Zeros**: In all examples, zeros are removed from the grid unless they form a column or row entirely filled with zeros. This seems to be the primary rule.

2. **Preservation of Non-Zero Elements**: Non-zero elements are preserved but reorganized such that columns or rows that were originally filled with zeros are collapsed, and non-zero elements shift to fill these spaces.

Let's apply these rules to the test case:

### Test Case Analysis
- **Row 1**: `[0, 5, 0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 8]`
  - Remove zeros: `[5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 8]`

- **Row 2**: `[2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 3, 0, 0, 8]`
  - Remove zeros: `[2, 2, 1, 5, 3, 8]`

- **Row 3**: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - This row is entirely zeros, so it remains unchanged.

### Example 1 Analysis
- **Input**: The grid contains `0`s and `5`s.
- **Output**: The grid contains `0`s, `1`s, `2`s, `3`s, and `4`s.
- **Transformation**:
  - The `5`s in the input are replaced with different numbers in the output.
  - The pattern suggests that the `5`s are being replaced with numbers that increase as you move down and to the right.

### Example 2 Analysis
- **Input**: Similar to Example 1, the grid contains `0`s and `5`s.
- **Output**: The grid contains `0`s, `1`s, `2`s, `3`s, and `4`s.
- **Transformation**:
  - The `5`s are replaced with numbers that increase as you move down and to the right.
  - The top-left `5` is replaced with `1`, the next `5` below it is replaced with `2`, and so on.

### General Rule
- The `5`s in the input are replaced with numbers that increase as you move down and to the right.
- The first `5` encountered is replaced with `1`, the next with `2`, and so on.

5. **Example 5**:
   - **Input**: `[7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - **Output**: 
     ```
     [
     [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - **Pattern**: The number of `7`s increases by one in each subsequent row until all elements are filled.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be described as follows:
- For each row in the output, the number of non-zero elements (i.e., the color value) increases by one starting from the first row.
- The rest of the elements in each row remain zero until they are filled.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case**:
- **Input**: `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

**Output**:
- **Row 1**: `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- **Row 2**: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- **Row 3**: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- **Row 4**: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- **Row 5**: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- **Row 6**: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- **Row 7**: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`
- **Row 8**: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`
- **Row 9**: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]`
- **Row 10**: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

Thus, the final output for the test case is:

f5b8619d,"To solve the transformation rule, we need to carefully observe the patterns in the training examples:

1. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Each cell in the original grid is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output grid.
   - The value in the original cell determines the values in the 2x2 block in the output grid.
   - If the original cell value is 0, the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid is filled with 0s and 8s in a checkerboard pattern.
   - If the original cell value is non-zero, the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid is filled with that value and 8s in a checkerboard pattern.

2. **Checkerboard Pattern:**
   - For a 2x2 block, if the top-left cell is 0 or a non-zero value `v`, the block will look like this:
     - If the top-left cell is 0:
       ```
       [0, 8]
       [8, 0]
       ```
     - If the top-left cell is a non-zero value `v`:
       ```
       [v, 8]
       [8, v]
       ```

3. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case:**
   - We will apply the same transformation rule to the test case grid.

b6afb2da,"To determine the transformation rule based on the provided examples, we need to observe how the 5's in the input grid are replaced by specific patterns in the output grid.

### Observations:
1. **5s in the corners**:
   - A single 5 in the corner is replaced by a 1.
   - For example, in Example 1, the top-left 5 becomes 1.

2. **5s along the edges**:
   - A 5 that is part of a sequence of 5s along an edge is replaced by a pattern of 1s and 4s.
   - Specifically, the first and last 5s in the sequence are replaced by 1s, and the middle 5s are replaced by 4s.
   - For example, in Example 1, the sequence [5, 5, 5, 5] becomes [1, 4, 4, 1].

3. **5s in the middle**:
   - A 5 that is part of a sequence of 5s in the middle of the grid is replaced by a pattern of 4s and 2s.
   - Specifically, the first and last 5s in the sequence are replaced by 4s, and the middle 5s are replaced by 2s.
   - For example, in Example 1, the sequence [5, 5, 5, 5] in the middle becomes [4, 2, 2, 4].

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
Let's apply these rules to the test case:

```python

[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
]
```

1. **Top section**:
   - The sequence of 5s in the first row is [5, 5, 5, 5].
   - It should be replaced by [1, 4, 4, 1].
   - The same applies to the subsequent rows up to the fifth row.

2. **Middle section**:
   - The sixth row also has the sequence [5, 5, 5, 5].
   - It should be replaced by [1, 4, 4, 1].

3. **Bottom section**:
   - The sequence of 5s in the eighth row is [5, 5, 5, 5, 5].
   - It should be replaced by [1, 4, 4, 4, 1].
   - The same applies to the ninth and tenth rows.

Applying these transformations, the output grid is:

1. **Example 1**: The input is a 3x3 grid with rows [1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1]. The output is a 3x1 grid with elements [1, 2, 1]. This suggests that the transformation might be extracting the first element of each row.

2. **Example 2**: The input is a 3x3 grid with rows [3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]. The output is a 1x3 grid with the first row of the input [3, 4, 6]. This suggests another possible rule where we keep only the first row.

3. **Example 3**: The input is a 3x5 grid with rows [2, 3, 3, 8, 1], [2, 3, 3, 8, 1], [2, 3, 3, 8, 1]. The output is a 1x4 grid with elements [2, 3, 8, 1]. This suggests that we might be removing repeated elements in the first row.

4. **Example 4**: The input is a 4x2 grid with rows [2, 2], [6, 6], [8, 8], [8, 8]. The output is a 3x1 grid with elements [2], [6], [8]. This suggests that we are keeping the first unique element of each row.

5. **Example 5**: The input is a 6x4 grid with rows [4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [8, 8, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3, 3]. The output is a 4x1 grid with elements [4], [2], [8], [3]. This further supports the idea of keeping the first unique element of each distinct row.

Given these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each row in the input grid, keep only the first unique element.
- If all rows are identical, extract the first unique element from the first row and form a single row output.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case**:
```

[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4]
]
```

Applying the rule:
- The first unique element of the first row is 1.
- The first unique element of the second row is 1.
- The first unique element of the third row is 1.
- The first unique element of the fourth row is 1.

Since all rows are identical, the output should be a 4x1 grid with the first unique element of the first row:

     [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
     ```
   - **Transformation Rule:** The `6` blocks are not changed. The `4` blocks appear in the bottom row where there are no other non-zero values.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [0, 3, 3, 3, 0],

     [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0]
     ```
   - **Transformation Rule:** The `8` and `6` blocks are not changed. The `4` blocks appear in the bottom row where there are no other non-zero values.

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ```
- **Transformation:**
  - The `5`, `8`, and `3` blocks are not changed.
  - The `4` blocks should be added to the bottom row where there are no other non-zero values.

3bd67248,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Observation of Diagonal Filling**: In all the examples, we notice that the first column remains unchanged while the rest of the columns are filled diagonally with a pattern starting from 2 and eventually becoming 4s.

2. **Pattern of 2s and 4s**:
   - The first row has a 2 in the last column.
   - The second row has a 2 one column to the left of the last column.
   - This continues until the diagonal reaches the first column, after which the remaining cells in the row are filled with 4s.

3. **General Rule**:
   - For each row \(i\), place a 2 at the position \(j = (n - i)\) where \(n\) is the number of columns.
   - If \(j\) is less than 0 (which means the 2 would go beyond the first column), fill the remaining cells in the row with 4s.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Input:

Applying the transformation rule:

- Row 1: Place 2 at column 10, resulting in `[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`.
- Row 2: Place 2 at column 9, resulting in `[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]`.
- Row 3: Place 2 at column 8, resulting in `[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]`.
- Row 4: Place 2 at column 7, resulting in `[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]`.
- Row 5: Place 2 at column 6, resulting in `[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- Row 6: Place 2 at column 5, resulting in `[3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

- Row 9: Place 2 at column 2, resulting in `[3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- Row 10: Place 2 at column 1, resulting in `[3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.

  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Diagonal Elements:** The diagonal elements (top-left to bottom-right) remain unchanged in all examples.
2. **Non-diagonal Elements:** The non-diagonal elements are replaced by the first non-zero element in their row or column, moving towards the diagonal.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],
  [2, 0, 8, 8, 5, 0],
  [2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]]
  ```

- **Step-by-Step Transformation:**
  - **First Row:**
    - Diagonal element: 5
    - Non-diagonal elements: Replace with 0 (since there are no non-zero elements before the diagonal).
  - **Second Row:**
    - Diagonal element: 5
    - Non-diagonal elements: Replace with 0 (since there are no non-zero elements before the diagonal).
  - **Third Row:**
    - Diagonal element: 5
    - Non-diagonal elements: Replace with 3 (since 3 is the first non-zero element before the diagonal).
  - **Fourth Row:**
    - Diagonal element: 5
    - Non-diagonal elements: Replace with 0 (since there are no non-zero elements before the diagonal).
  - **Fifth Row:**
    - Diagonal element: 5
    - Non-diagonal elements: Replace with 2, 8, 8 (since these are the first non-zero elements before the diagonal).
  - **Sixth Row:**
    - Diagonal element: 5
    - Non-diagonal elements: Replace with 2, 6, 0, 0 (since these are the first non-zero elements before the diagonal).

### Final Output:
```
[
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],
[2, 0, 8, 8, 5, 0],
[2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5]]
```

However, upon re-evaluating the rule, it seems the non-diagonal elements should be replaced by the first non-zero element in their respective columns. Let's apply this corrected rule:

### Corrected Final Output:
```
[
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],
[2, 0, 8, 8, 5, 0],

     [0, 0, 0]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [0, 0, 0],
     [1, 1, 1],
     [0, 0, 0]
     ```
   - Observation: The row containing `1`s has moved down by one position.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input:
     ```
     [0, 0, 0],
     [1, 1, 1],
     [0, 0, 0]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0],
     [1, 1, 1]
     ```
   - Observation: The row containing `1`s has moved down by one position.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input:
     ```
     [0, 1, 0],
     [1, 1, 0],
     [0, 0, 0]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [0, 0, 0],
     [0, 1, 0],
     [1, 1, 0]
     ```
   - Observation: The rows containing non-zero elements have moved down by one position.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input:
     ```
     [0, 2, 2],
     [0, 0, 2],
     [0, 0, 0]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [0, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 2],
     [0, 0, 2]
     ```
   - Observation: The rows containing non-zero elements have moved down by one position.

From these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule is to move all non-zero rows down by one position, with the top row being replaced by a row of zeros.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the test case:

- **Test Case**:
  - Input:
    ```
    [2, 0, 0],
    [2, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0]
    ```

- **Transformation**:
  - Move the first row down to the second row.
  - Move the second row down to the third row.
  - Replace the top row with a row of zeros.

- **Output**:
  ```
  [0, 0, 0],
  [2, 0, 0],
  [2, 0, 0]
  ```

ae3edfdc,"The transformation rule seems to be that if there is a non-zero cell, its value is propagated to its direct neighbors (up, down, left, right) if those neighbors are zero. This process continues iteratively until no more changes can be made.

d4a91cb9,"To understand the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The grid has an `8` at position (2,1) and a `2` at position (9,9).
   - In the output, a vertical line of `4`s connects the `8` and the `2`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The grid has an `8` at position (1,8) and a `2` at position (5,1).
   - In the output, a vertical line of `4`s connects the `8` and the `2`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The grid has an `8` at position (10,2) and a `2` at position (1,8).
   - In the output, a vertical line of `4`s connects the `8` and the `2`.

From these examples, we can deduce the following transformation rule:
- Identify the positions of `8` and `2` in the grid.
- Draw a vertical line of `4`s connecting the `8` and `2`.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case:**
- The grid has an `8` at position (8,3) and a `2` at position (2,11).

**Transformation:**
- Draw a vertical line of `4`s from (2,11) down to (8,11), then move horizontally to (8,3).

Let's implement this transformation:

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
    # Find the positions of 8 and 2
    pos_8 = None
    pos_2 = None
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[i])):
            if grid[i][j] == 8:
                pos_8 = (i, j)
            elif grid[i][j] == 2:
                pos_2 = (i, j)

    # Ensure both 8 and 2 are found
    if pos_8 is None or pos_2 is None:
        return grid

    # Draw the vertical line of 4s
    y1, x1 = pos_8
    y2, x2 = pos_2
    if x1 != x2:

### Analysis:
- In both examples, the row containing non-zero values (other than 0) is transformed.
- The transformation fills the row with the first non-zero value until it reaches the middle column (index 5 in a 0-indexed 11-column grid).
- After the middle column, the row is filled with the second non-zero value.

4612dd53,"To figure out the transformation rule, I analyzed the provided training examples:

### Example 1 Analysis:
- **Input:** A grid with some `1`s and many `0`s.
- **Output:** The `1`s remain in the same positions, but additional `2`s appear adjacent to the `1`s.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input:** Similar to Example 1, but with more complex shapes formed by `1`s.
- **Output:** The `1`s remain in the same positions, and `2`s appear adjacent to the `1`s, filling in gaps where `1`s are close to each other.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- **Input:** Another grid with a different arrangement of `1`s.
- **Output:** Again, the `1`s remain in the same positions, and `2`s appear adjacent to the `1`s, filling in gaps where `1`s are close to each other.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- **Rule:** For each `1` in the input grid, if any of its 4-adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are `0`, change those `0`s to `2`.

995c5fa3,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Observation**: The output grids are smaller than the input grids. Specifically, they are 3x3 matrices.
2. **Pattern Identification**:
   - In all examples, the input grids have a consistent structure with rows of `5`s interrupted by `0`s.
   - The output grids seem to be derived from specific sections of the input grids.

Let's examine the first example in detail:
- **Input**:
  ```
  [
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0],
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0],
  [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  ]
  ```
- **Output**:
  ```
  [
  [2, 2, 2],
  [8, 8, 8],
  [3, 3, 3]
  ]
  ```

We notice that the output grid is formed by taking 3x3 sub-grids from the input grid and applying some transformation. Let's hypothesize that the rule involves the positions of `0`s in the input grid:

- The first row of the output grid corresponds to the top-left 3x3 sub-grid of the input grid.
- The second row of the output grid corresponds to the middle 3x3 sub-grid of the input grid.
- The third row of the output grid corresponds to the bottom-right 3x3 sub-grid of the input grid.

However, the values in the output grid are not directly from the input grid but seem to be determined by the distribution of `0`s in the corresponding 3x3 sub-grids.

Let's apply this hypothesis to the test case:

**Test Case Input**:
```
[
[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],
[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5],
[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5],
[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]
]
```

**Step-by-Step Transformation**:
1. **Top-Left 3x3 Sub-grid**:
   ```
   [
   [5, 5, 5],
   [5, 5, 5],
   [5, 0, 0]
   ]
   ```
   - This sub-grid has 2 zeros in the bottom row.
   - Corresponding value in the output grid: 2

2. **Middle 3x3 Sub-grid**:
   ```
   [
   [5, 5, 5],
   [0, 0, 5],
   [0, 0, 5]
   ]
   ```
   - This sub-grid has 4 zeros.
   - Corresponding value in the output grid: 4

3. **Bottom-Right 3x3 Sub-grid**:
   ```
   [
   [5, 5, 5],
   [5, 0, 0],
   [5, 5, 5]
   ]
   ```
   - This sub-grid has 2 zeros in the middle row.
   - Corresponding value in the output grid: 2

  [6, 8, 6]
  [8, 6, 8]
  [1, 6, 1]
  ```
- **Transformation:**
  - Mirror each row horizontally:
    - `[6, 8, 6]` becomes `[6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 6]`
    - `[8, 6, 8]` becomes `[8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8]`
    - `[1, 6, 1]` becomes `[1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1]`

6e19193c,"To determine the transformation rule based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. **Pattern Observation**:
   - In both examples, any non-zero number (e.g., 7 or 9) in the input grid is moved diagonally to the right and down.
   - Specifically, if a cell `(i, j)` contains a non-zero number `x`, it moves to the cell `(i+1, j+1)`.

2. **Transformation Rule**:
   - For each non-zero value in the input grid, move it one cell to the right and one cell down.
   - If the move would place the value outside the grid boundaries, the value is not moved to that position.

3. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**:
   - We will apply the same rule to the test case, moving each non-zero value one cell to the right and one cell down.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
```

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Applying the transformation rule:

- Move the 8 from `(2, 4)` to `(3, 5)`
- Move the 8 from `(3, 3)` to `(4, 4)`
- Move the 8 from `(3, 4)` to `(4, 5)`
- Move the 8 from `(4, 7)` to `(5, 8)`
- Move the 8 from `(4, 8)` to `(5, 9)`
- Move the 8 from `(5, 7)` to `(6, 8)`
- Move the 8 from `(6, 2)` to `(7, 3)`
- Move the 8 from `(6, 3)` to `(7, 4)`
- Move the 8 from `(7, 3)` to `(8, 4)`

ce4f8723,"To understand the transformation rule from input to output, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Observation**:
   - The output grid is smaller than the input grid.
   - The top-left 4x4 section of the input grid seems to influence the output grid.
   - The number 3 appears frequently in the output, suggesting a specific transformation involving the value 3.

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - In Example 1, the input has a pattern where 1s and 0s are arranged in a specific way. The output grid is filled with 3s except where there are 0s in the top-left 4x4 section of the input.
   - In Example 2, the same pattern holds: the output grid is filled with 3s except where there are 0s in the top-left 4x4 section of the input.
   - In Example 3, the same pattern is observed: the output grid is filled with 3s except where there are 0s in the top-left 4x4 section of the input.
   - In Example 4, the same pattern is observed: the output grid is filled with 3s except where there are 0s in the top-left 4x4 section of the input.

3. **Transformation Rule**:
   - The output grid is derived from the top-left 4x4 section of the input grid.
   - Each cell in the output grid is set to 3 if the corresponding cell in the top-left 4x4 section of the input grid is not 0.
   - If the corresponding cell in the top-left 4x4 section of the input grid is 0, the cell in the output grid is also 0.

4. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**:
   - The top-left 4x4 section of the test input grid is:
     ```

     [1, 0, 1, 0],
     [0, 1, 0, 0],
     [1, 0, 1, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Applying the transformation rule:
     - Cell (0,0) is 1 → Output (0,0) is 3
     - Cell (0,1) is 0 → Output (0,1) is 0
     - Cell (0,2) is 1 → Output (0,2) is 3
     - Cell (0,3) is 0 → Output (0,3) is 0
     - Cell (1,0) is 1 → Output (1,0) is 3
     - Cell (1,1) is 0 → Output (1,1) is 0
     - Cell (1,2) is 1 → Output (1,2) is 3
     - Cell (1,3) is 0 → Output (1,3) is 0
     - Cell (2,0) is 0 → Output (2,0) is 0

928ad970,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the transformation rule applied in the training examples. Let's break down the pattern:

### Observations from Training Examples:
1. **Non-zero Cells:** Non-zero cells that are not part of the ""main shape"" remain unchanged.
2. **Main Shape:** The main shape is identified as a contiguous group of non-zero cells of the same value.
3. **Surrounding Cells:** The cells surrounding the main shape are filled with the value of the main shape.

### Steps to Apply the Transformation Rule:
1. **Identify the Main Shape:** Find the contiguous group of non-zero cells that form the main shape.
2. **Surround the Main Shape:** Fill all the cells around the main shape with the value of the main shape.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
1. **Identify the Main Shape:**
   - The main shape is the group of `8`'s in the middle of the grid.

2. **Surround the Main Shape:**
   - Fill all the cells around the `8`'s with `8`.

1. **Example 1**: 
   - Input has two `4`s in the 4th row and 6th row.
   - Output adds a `2` in the middle column between the two `4`s (5th row).

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input has two `4`s in the 2nd and 7th rows.
   - Output adds a block of `2`s spanning the columns between the two `4`s and the rows between the two `4`s.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input has two `4`s in the 2nd and 4th rows in the 2nd and 4th columns, and another pair of `4`s in the 7th and 10th columns in the 7th and 10th rows.
   - Output adds a `2` in the middle of the first pair (3rd row, 3rd column) and a block of `2`s spanning the columns between the second pair of `4`s (8th and 9th rows, 6th to 9th columns).

From these observations, the rule seems to be:
- For every pair of `4`s in the same row or column, add a `2` in the middle if they are next to each other, or add a block of `2`s spanning the space between them.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case**:
- We have pairs of `4`s in the following positions:
  - (1, 6) and (1, 10)
  - (5, 6) and (5, 10)
  - (6, 1) and (6, 4)
  - (9, 1) and (9, 4)

Applying the rule:
- For (1, 6) and (1, 10), add a block of `2`s from columns 7 to 9 in row 1.
- For (5, 6) and (5, 10), add a block of `2`s from columns 7 to 9 in row 5.
- For (6, 1) and (6, 4), add a block of `2`s from columns 2 to 3 in row 6.
- For (9, 1) and (9, 4), add a block of `2`s from columns 2 to 3 in row 9.

1. **Identifying the Pattern**:
   - In all examples, the output grids seem to be smaller than the input grids.
   - The output grids appear to be composed of the corner elements of certain sub-grids in the input grids.

2. **Examining Example 1**:
   - The input grid is 8x8.
   - The output grid is 4x4.
   - The output grid seems to be formed by taking the corners of 2x2 sub-grids from the input grid.

3. **Generalizing the Rule**:
   - For an input grid of size \( n \times m \), the output grid is \( \frac{n}{2} \times \frac{m}{2} \).
   - Each element in the output grid corresponds to one of the four corners of a 2x2 sub-grid in the input grid.

4. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**:
   - The test case input grid is 10x10.
   - The output grid should be 5x5.
   - We need to extract the corners of 2x2 sub-grids from the input grid.

cbded52d,"To understand the transformation rule applied in the examples, we need to closely compare the input and output grids. By analyzing the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- The transformation rule seems to affect only specific columns.
- In the first example, the 3rd column from the end (columns are 0-indexed) has been changed so that all elements in this column match the element directly above them.
- In the second example, the 5th column from the end has been changed similarly.
- In the third example, the 3rd column from the end has been changed.

Based on these observations, the rule can be generalized as follows:
- For each row, if the element in the 3rd column from the end is not zero, it is replaced by the element directly above it in the previous row.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Input Grid:**
```
[
[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
[1, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[6, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 6, 1],
[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 8]
]
```

**Transformation:**
- The 3rd column from the end is the 5th column (index 5).
- We need to check if the element in this column is not zero and replace it with the element directly above it.

Applying the rule:

- Row 1: [1, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 8] -> No change needed.
- Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> No change needed.
- Row 3: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1] -> No change needed.
- Row 4: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1] -> No change needed.
- Row 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> No change needed.
- Row 6: [6, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 6, 1] -> No change needed.
- Row 7: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 8] -> Change the 5th column (index 5) from 0 to 1 (from the row above).

The final transformed grid is:

**Output Grid:**
```
[
[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
[1, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

c8cbb738,"To determine the transformation rule from the input to the output:

1. **Pattern Identification**:
   - In all examples, the output grid is much smaller than the input grid.
   - The output grid appears to capture the unique non-8 values in a specific pattern.

2. **Grid Reduction**:
   - Each output grid seems to be a 5x5 grid, regardless of the size of the input grid.
   - The output grid captures the unique non-8 values in a symmetrical pattern.

3. **Symmetry and Unique Values**:
   - The center of the output grid seems to capture the most frequent non-8 value.
   - The corners and edges of the output grid capture other unique non-8 values that appear in the input grid.

4. **Applying the Rule**:
   - For the test case, we need to identify the unique non-8 values and place them in a 5x5 grid in a symmetrical pattern.
   - The most frequent non-8 value should be placed in the center.
   - The other unique non-8 values should be placed in the corners and edges.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- The output grid is a 3x3 grid.
- The value in the output grid at position (i, j) corresponds to whether there is a 6 in the corresponding 4x4 subgrid in the input grid, starting from the top-left corner.

Let's break down the process:

1. Divide the 11x11 input grid into 4x4 subgrids.
2. Check if any of the cells in each 4x4 subgrid contain the value 6.
3. If a 6 is found in a 4x4 subgrid, set the corresponding cell in the 3x3 output grid to 1; otherwise, set it to 0.

44d8ac46,"The transformation rule appears to change certain cells within the grid from 5 to 2 if they are surrounded by 5s on all four sides (up, down, left, right). Let's apply this rule to the test case.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the regions where 5s are surrounded by other 5s:**
   - In the top-left block (rows 1-5, columns 1-5), the inner 5s are surrounded by 5s.
   - In the bottom-right block (rows 9-11, columns 3-7), the inner 5s are surrounded by 5s.

2. **Change the identified 5s to 2s:**
   - For the top-left block:
     - Change the 5s at positions (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) to 2s.
   - For the bottom-right block:
     - Change the 5s at positions (10,4), (10,5), (10,6), (11,4), (11,5), (11,6) to 2s.

67385a82,"To determine the transformation rule applied in the examples, we need to observe the changes from the input to the output:

1. In all examples, the number `3` is consistently replaced with `8`.
2. Other numbers (like `0`) remain unchanged.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule can be described as follows:
- Replace every `3` in the grid with `8`.
- Leave other numbers unchanged.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case:
```
[
[3, 0, 3, 0, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
[0, 3, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 3, 3, 0, 0]]
```

Applying the transformation rule:
- Replace every `3` with `8`.

- Transformed grid:

1b2d62fb,"To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Observation**:
   - In all examples, the output grid has a fixed size of 3x3.
   - The output grid seems to focus on the central 3x3 area of the input grid.

2. **Pattern**:
   - The central 3x3 area of the input grid is extracted.
   - If the central cell (position [2][2] in the 3x3 area) is 1, the cells around it (excluding the central cell) are set to 8 if they are 9 in the input grid.

3. **Transformation Rule**:
   - Extract the central 3x3 area from the input grid.
   - If the central cell (position [2][2]) is 1, change all surrounding cells (positions [1][1], [1][2], [1][3], [2][1], [2][3], [3][1], [3][2], [3][3]) that are 9 to 8.
   - All other cells remain 0.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case Input**:
```
[
[9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0],
[0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0],
[9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 0, 9],
[0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 9, 9]
]
```

**Step-by-Step Transformation**:
1. Extract the central 3x3 area:
   ```
   [
   [9, 1, 0],
   [0, 1, 0],
   [0, 1, 9]
   ]
   ```

2. Check the central cell (position [2][2]):
   - The central cell is 1.

3. Change the surrounding cells that are 9 to 8:
   - Position [1][1] (9) changes to 8.
   - Position [3][3] (9) changes to 8.

4. The resulting 3x3 grid is:
   ```
   [
   [8, 0, 0],
   [0, 1, 0],
   [0, 1, 8]
   ]
   ```

However, the rule specifies that only the surrounding cells (not including the central cell) should be changed if the central cell is 1. Therefore, the final output should be:
   ```
   [
   [8, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0],

09629e4f,"To solve the test case, I'll analyze the transformation pattern based on the provided training examples:

### Observations:
1. **Horizontal and Vertical Bands:** 
   - The middle row (row 4) and the middle column (column 5) remain unchanged in all examples. This suggests that the transformation preserves the central row and column.
   
2. **Grouping of Non-5 Values:**
   - All non-5 values are replaced by the most frequent non-5 value in their respective 3x3 block. For example, if a 3x3 block contains multiple 2s, all non-5 values in that block are replaced with 2.

### Steps to Apply the Transformation:
1. **Identify the Middle Row and Column:**
   - In an 11x11 grid, the middle row is the 6th row (index 5) and the middle column is the 6th column (index 5).

2. **Divide the Grid into 3x3 Blocks:**
   - Each 3x3 block is processed independently, except for the middle row and column which remain unchanged.

3. **Replace Non-5 Values:**
   - For each 3x3 block, count the frequency of each non-5 value.
   - Replace all non-5 values in the block with the most frequent non-5 value.

539a4f51,"To solve the test case, we need to understand the transformation rule applied in the training examples.

### Observations:
1. **Horizontal Expansion**: 
   - The grid is horizontally expanded to double its width.
   - Each row in the input is repeated next to itself in the output.

2. **Vertical Expansion**:
   - The grid is vertically expanded to double its height.
   - After the horizontal expansion, the entire grid is duplicated below itself.

3. **Border Filling**:
   - The new rows and columns added during the expansion are filled with the color of the nearest original cell.
   - For example, if a new row is added at the bottom, it is filled with the color of the bottommost row of the original grid.

### Applying the Transformation Rule to the Test Case:

Given the test case:
```
[
[7, 7, 3, 2, 2],
[7, 7, 3, 2, 2],
[3, 3, 3, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
]
```

1. **Horizontal Expansion**:
   - Each row is repeated next to itself.
   - The result after horizontal expansion:
   ```
   [
   [7, 7, 3, 2, 2, 7, 7, 3, 2, 2],
   [7, 7, 3, 2, 2, 7, 7, 3, 2, 2],

   [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
   ]
   ```

2. **Vertical Expansion**:
   - The entire grid is duplicated below itself.
   - The result after vertical expansion:
   ```

   [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
   ]

3. **Border Filling**:
   - Since the grid is already expanded to double its size, no additional border filling is needed.

### Example 1:
- **Input:** Contains a large pattern of `1`s.
- **Output:** The `1`s are replaced with `3`s, but only in the regions where they form a connected shape.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** Contains smaller patterns of `1`s.
- **Output:** The `1`s in the top-left region are replaced with `3`s, while the `1`s in the bottom-right region remain unchanged.

### Example 3:
- **Input:** Contains a pattern of `1`s.
- **Output:** The `1`s in the top region are replaced with `3`s, while the `1`s in the bottom region remain unchanged.

### General Rule:
- **Transformation:** Replace `1`s with `3`s if they form a connected shape that is not touching the border of the grid. If the `1`s touch the border, they remain `1`s.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Test Input:**

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```

- **Analysis:**
  - The `1`s in the top-left region (rows 1-4) form a connected shape that does not touch the border, so they should be replaced with `3`s.
  - The `1`s in the bottom region (rows 7-11) also form a connected shape that does not touch the border, so they should be replaced with `3`s.
  - The `1`s in the middle (row 5) touch the border, so they remain `1`s.

7b7f7511,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided training examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `[[1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2], [1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3], [3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1], [2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1]]`
   - Output: `[[1, 1, 3, 2], [1, 1, 3, 3], [3, 3, 1, 1], [2, 3, 1, 1]]`
   - Observation: The output is the first half of each row of the input.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `[[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [6, 4, 8, 6, 4, 8], [6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 8]]`
   - Output: `[[4, 4, 4], [6, 4, 8], [6, 6, 8]]`
   - Observation: The output is the first half of each row of the input.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `[[2, 3], [3, 2], [4, 4], [2, 3], [3, 2], [4, 4]]`
   - Output: `[[2, 3], [3, 2], [4, 4]]`
   - Observation: The output is the first half of the rows of the input (since the input has only two columns, the first half is the entire row).

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be: **Take the first half of each row of the input grid.**

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

- Test Input: `[[5, 4, 5], [4, 5, 4], [6, 6, 4], [2, 6, 2], [5, 4, 5], [4, 5, 4], [6, 6, 4], [2, 6, 2]]`

Since each row has 3 elements, the first half would be the first 2 elements of each row.

d9fac9be,"To determine the transformation rule, let's review the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: The input contains multiple 2s, and the output is `[2]`. This suggests that the number that appears in the corners or edges might be the target.
- **Example 2**: The input contains multiple 8s, and the output is `[8]`. This also fits the pattern of selecting a number from the edges or corners.
- **Example 3**: The input contains multiple 1s, and the output is `[1]`. Again, this number is present on the edges.
- **Example 4**: The input contains multiple 8s, and the output is `[8]`. This is consistent with the previous observations.

From these examples, it seems that the transformation rule is to identify a number that appears on the edges or corners of the input grid and return it as the output. If there are multiple such numbers, any one of them can be chosen.

1. **Example 1**:
   - Original: A grid with rows of 5s in the middle and 0s and 5s elsewhere.
   - Transformed: The top-left and bottom-right corners are filled with 1s and 3s respectively, and the middle sections have 2s added.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Original: Similar to Example 1 but with different positions of 5s and 0s.
   - Transformed: The top-left corner has 1s, the middle has 2s, and the bottom-right corner has 3s.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Original: A grid with alternating 5s and 0s in a checkerboard pattern except for the full rows of 5s.
   - Transformed: The top-left corner has 1s, the middle has 2s, and the bottom-right corner has 3s.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Replace the top-left corner (up to the first row of 5s) with 1s.
- Replace the middle section (between the rows of 5s) with 2s.
- Replace the bottom-right corner (after the last row of 5s) with 3s.

a79310a0,"To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let's analyze the provided examples:

### Example 1:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ```
In this example, the block of 8s in the top-left corner has been shifted down by one row and replaced with 2s.

### Example 2:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [0, 8, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 2, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
  ```
Here, the single 8 in the center of the first row has been shifted down by one row and replaced with a 2.

### Example 3:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 8, 8, 8, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

  ```
In this example, the block of 8s in the second row has been shifted down by one row and replaced with 2s.

### General Rule:
The rule appears to be:
- Identify blocks of 8s.
- Shift these blocks down by one row.
- Replace the 8s with 2s in the new position.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
  [0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ```

- **Step-by-step Transformation:**
  - Identify the 8s:
    - First row: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0] → Shift down to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    - Second row: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0] → Shift down to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    - Third row: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0] → Shift down to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  - Replace the 8s with 2s in the new positions:
    - New second row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
    - New third row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
    - New fourth row: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] → [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]

ce9e57f2,"To solve this puzzle, we need to understand the transformation rule that changes the input grid to the output grid. From the examples provided, we can observe the following pattern:

1. **Initial Setup**: The input grid contains a pattern of 2s and 0s.
2. **Transformation Rule**: Starting from the bottom, any 2 that is directly below another 2 or an 8 is changed to 8. This transformation continues upwards until there are no more 2s directly below another 2 or 8.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:

### Step-by-Step Transformation

1. **Bottom Row**: 
   - The last row has 2s in positions (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 5), and (7, 7).
   - Since there are no 2s or 8s directly below these positions, they remain 2s.

2. **Row 10**:
   - The second-to-last row has 2s in positions (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), and (6, 7).
   - Since there are 2s directly below these positions in the last row, they change to 8s.
   - New row: [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]

3. **Row 9**:
   - The third-to-last row has 2s in positions (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), and (5, 7).
   - Since there are 8s directly below these positions in the row above, they change to 8s.
   - New row: [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]

4. **Row 8**:
   - The fourth-to-last row has 2s in positions (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), and (4, 7).
   - Since there are 8s directly below these positions in the row above, they change to 8s.
   - New row: [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]

5. **Row 7**:
   - The fifth-to-last row has 2s in positions (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), and (3, 7).
   - Since there are 8s directly below these positions in the row above, they change to 8s.
   - New row: [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]

6. **Row 6**:
   - The sixth-to-last row has 2s in positions (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), and (2, 7).
   - Since there are 8s directly below these positions in the row above, they change to 8s.
   - New row: [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]

7. **Row 5**:
   - The seventh-to-last row has 2s in positions (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), and (1, 7).
   - Since there are 8s directly below these positions in the row above, they change to 8s.
   - New row: [0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]

8. **Row 4**:
   - The eighth-to-last row has 2s in positions (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), and (0, 7).
   - Since there are 8s directly below these positions in the row above, they change to 8s.

eb281b96,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the transformation rule used in the provided examples. Let's analyze the patterns:

### Example 1:
- **Input**: 
  - 3 rows, 17 columns
  - Pattern: Alternating 0s and 8s in a checkerboard pattern.
- **Output**:
  - 9 rows, 17 columns
  - The pattern is repeated in a vertical checkerboard pattern, with each row being either the same as the first row or the second row.

### Example 2:
- **Input**:
  - 4 rows, 17 columns
  - Pattern: Alternating 0s and 2s in a checkerboard pattern.
- **Output**:
  - 13 rows, 17 columns
  - The pattern is repeated in a vertical checkerboard pattern, with each row being either the same as the first row or the second row.

### General Rule:
- The output grid is created by repeating the input grid in a vertical checkerboard pattern. Specifically, the first row of the input is followed by the second row, and this pattern continues until the desired height is achieved.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input**:
  - 5 rows, 17 columns
  - Pattern: Alternating 0s and 3s in a checkerboard pattern.

### Example 1:
- **Input:** A grid with a block of `2`s in the middle and a block of `7`s at the bottom.
- **Output:** The output is the same as the input except that there is an additional block of `8`s in the middle where there was previously only zeros.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** A grid with a block of `4`s on the left and a block of `6`s on the right.
- **Output:** The output is the same as the input except that there is an additional block of `8`s in the middle where there was previously only zeros.

### Example 3:
- **Input:** A grid with a block of `3`s at the top and a block of `9`s at the bottom.
- **Output:** The output is the same as the input except that there is an additional block of `8`s in the middle where there was previously only zeros.

### General Rule:
- The transformation rule appears to be adding a block of `8`s in the middle of the grid, where there are zeros surrounded by non-zero values. The size of the block of `8`s seems to match the size of the largest block of zeros that is surrounded by non-zero values.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:

- **Output:**
  - There is a block of zeros in the middle of the grid, surrounded by non-zero values.
  - The size of this block is 5x5.
  - Therefore, we need to replace this block of zeros with `8`s.

a3df8b1e,"To solve this problem, I'll first analyze the pattern in the provided examples:

1. In all three training examples, the input grid starts with several rows of zeros.
2. The final row contains a `1` at the first position and zeros elsewhere.
3. The output grids show a pattern where the `1` is shifted right one column at every other row, starting from the second row.

Let's break down the pattern more formally:
- The `1` appears on the first row at the last index (rightmost column).
- It then shifts left by one column on the next row.
- This alternating shift continues until the end of the grid.

Given this pattern, let's apply it to the test case:

### Test Case Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

### Applying the Pattern:
- Start with the first row: place `1` at the last index (4th column).
- For the second row: place `1` at the second-to-last index (3rd column).
- Continue this alternating pattern for each subsequent row.

### Resulting Output:

b0c4d837,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples.

1. **Observation 1:** The output grid is always a 3x3 grid.
2. **Observation 2:** The central 3x3 area of the input grid seems to influence the output grid.
3. **Observation 3:** The value 8 in the output grid corresponds to the presence of 8s in the central 3x3 area of the input grid.
4. **Observation 4:** The value 0 in the output grid corresponds to the absence of 8s in the corresponding position in the central 3x3 area of the input grid.

Let's apply these observations to the test case:

**Test Case Input:**
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0],

```

**Central 3x3 Area of the Input Grid:**
```
[
[5, 8, 8],
[5, 8, 8],
[5, 8, 8]
]
```

**Transformation:**
- The central 3x3 area contains 8s in all positions except the top-left corner, which has a 5.
- Therefore, the output grid will have 8s where there are 8s in the central 3x3 area and 0s where there are not 8s.

**Output:**

c59eb873,"To determine the transformation rule applied in these examples, we need to analyze the changes from the input to the output grids.

### Analysis of Transformation:
1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     [
     [0, 5, 1],
     [5, 5, 5],
     [2, 5, 0]]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [0, 0, 5, 5, 1, 1],
     [0, 0, 5, 5, 1, 1],
     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
     [2, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0],
     [2, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0]]
     ```
   - Observation: Each cell value is repeated twice horizontally and vertically. This suggests a scaling transformation where each cell is expanded to a 2x2 block.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [2, 1],
     [3, 1]]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [2, 2, 1, 1],
     [2, 2, 1, 1],
     [3, 3, 1, 1],
     [3, 3, 1, 1]]
     ```
   - Observation: The same pattern is observed here. Each cell value is repeated twice both horizontally and vertically.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [2, 0, 3, 0],
     [2, 1, 3, 0],
     [0, 0, 3, 3],
     [0, 0, 3, 5]]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],
     [2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],
     [2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 0],
     [2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 5],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 5, 5]]
     ```
   - Observation: Again, each cell value is repeated twice both horizontally and vertically.

### Conclusion:
The transformation rule is to scale each cell value by a factor of 2 in both dimensions (horizontally and vertically).

a2fd1cf0,"To determine the transformation rule, let's review the provided examples:

1. In Example 1, a `2` in the input grid gets surrounded by `8`s in the output grid, extending vertically down until it reaches another non-zero value (in this case, a `3`).
2. In Example 2, a `2` in the input grid gets surrounded by `8`s in the output grid, extending horizontally right until it reaches another non-zero value (in this case, a `3`).
3. In Example 3, a `2` in the input grid gets surrounded by `8`s in the output grid, extending both vertically down and horizontally left until it reaches other non-zero values (in this case, a `3`).

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each `2` in the input grid, replace it with `2` and fill the cells below, above, to the left, and to the right with `8` until another non-zero value is encountered or the edge of the grid is reached.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

```

Applying the rule:
- The `2` at position (3, 2) will be replaced by `2`.
- Fill the cells below (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), and (10, 2) with `8` until reaching the `3` at (11, 11).

   - Observation: The input grid is repeated twice, but with the first and third rows swapped.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule is:
- Repeat the input grid twice.
- Swap the first and third rows in the repeated grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case:**
- Input:

447fd412,"To solve the puzzle, we need to understand the transformation rule applied in the training examples. Let's analyze the changes:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input has a small shape formed by `1` and `2`.
   - Output adds a new shape below the existing one, extending the `1`s and `2`s.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input has scattered `1`s and `2`s.
   - Output connects these `1`s and `2`s into larger shapes where they are adjacent or close to each other.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input has a small shape on top and a larger horizontal shape at the bottom.
   - Output extends the smaller shape to connect with the larger shape at the bottom.

From these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- **Extend and Connect**: Extend the shapes formed by `1`s and `2`s to connect them if they are close to each other.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

### Test Case Analysis
- The test case has several small shapes formed by `1`s and `2`s.
- We need to extend and connect these shapes where possible.

### Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Top-left shape**:
   - Extend the `1`s downwards to connect with the `2` on the right.

2. **Middle shape**:
   - Extend the `1`s downwards to connect with the `2`s at the bottom.

3. **Bottom shape**:
   - Extend the `2`s upwards to connect with the `1`s above.

4. **Right shape**:
   - Extend the `2`s upwards to connect with the `1`s above.

### Final Transformation
Applying the extension and connection rules, we get the following output:

a699fb00,"To determine the transformation rule, I'll analyze the provided examples:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - In all examples, `1` cells in the input that have exactly two adjacent `1` cells (horizontally or vertically) get transformed into `2` in the output.
   - Cells that remain `1` in the output are those that do not have exactly two adjacent `1` cells.

2. **Transformation Rule**:
   - For each cell with value `1`, check its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).
   - If exactly two of these neighbors are also `1`, change the cell to `2`.
   - Otherwise, leave the cell as `1`.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

0ca9ddb6,"To solve this puzzle, we need to understand the transformation rule applied to the examples provided. Let's analyze the changes:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - In all examples, numbers 1 and 2 are surrounded by 4s and 7s.
   - The number 1 is always surrounded by 7s in a cross pattern.
   - The number 2 is always surrounded by 4s in a cross pattern.
   - Numbers 6 and 8 remain unchanged.

2. **Transformation Rule**:
   - For each cell containing a 1, place 7s in the cells directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of the 1.
   - For each cell containing a 2, place 4s in the cells directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of the 2.
   - Numbers 6 and 8 remain unchanged.
   - All other cells (containing 0s) remain 0s unless they are part of the surrounding pattern.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

### Applying the Transformation Rule
- For the 1 at position (2, 6):
  - Place 7s at positions (1, 6), (3, 6), (2, 5), and (2, 7).
- For the 2 at position (3, 2):
  - Place 4s at positions (2, 2), (4, 2), (3, 1), and (3, 3).
- For the 2 at position (7, 7):

- In all examples, the positions that originally have a value of `2` remain `2`.
- The positions that originally have a value of `0` are sometimes changed to `4`.

By examining the patterns more closely:

1. **First Row:**
   - The first row has `2`s at regular intervals.
   - The `0`s between these `2`s are replaced with `4`s starting from the second `0` after the first `2`.

2. **Second Row:**
   - The second row alternates between `0` and `2`.
   - The `0`s are replaced with `4`s starting from the second `0` after the first `2`.

3. **Third Row:**
   - The third row has `2`s at regular intervals.
   - The `0`s between these `2`s are replaced with `4`s starting from the second `0` after the first `2`.

Given this pattern, we can apply the same rule to the test case:

### Test Case Analysis
- **First Row:** Replace every second `0` with `4` starting from the second `0` after the first `2`.
- **Second Row:** Replace every second `0` with `4` starting from the second `0` after the first `2`.
- **Third Row:** Replace every second `0` with `4` starting from the second `0` after the first `2`.

53b68214,"To find the transformation rule applied in the examples, we can observe that:

- In Example 1, the pattern of 1s is extended downwards, creating a mirror image of the original pattern of 1s.
- In Example 2, the pattern of 3s is extended downwards, creating a longer column of 3s that matches the length of the output grid.
- In Example 3, the pattern of 2s is extended downwards, creating a longer column of 2s that matches the length of the output grid.

The common rule across all examples is that the height of the grid is doubled, and the original pattern is mirrored along the vertical axis, maintaining the original pattern's color and position.

Applying this rule to the test case:

**Transformation Steps:**

1. Fill the outermost layer with `3`s.
2. Fill the next inner layer with `3`s at the corners and along the edges, and `0`s in the middle.
3. Continue this pattern inward, alternating layers of `3` and `0`.

**Output Grid:**

3906de3d,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

### Example 1 Analysis:
- **Input:** The grid contains two separate blocks of `1`s and `2`s.
- **Output:** The block of `2`s has been moved up to fill in the gaps in the block of `1`s.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input:** Similar to Example 1, but with more complex shapes.
- **Output:** The `2`s have been moved up to fill in the gaps in the `1` block.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- **Input:** More complex shapes with multiple `2`s.
- **Output:** The `2`s have been moved up and to the left to fill in the gaps in the `1` block.

### General Transformation Rule:
- **Rule:** Move the `2`s upwards and to the left until they fill in the gaps in the `1` block. If there are no `1`s above or to the left, the `2`s stay in their original position.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Test Input:**
  ```
  [
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],

  [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0]
  ]
  ```

- **Step-by-Step Transformation:**
  - Move the `2`s upwards and to the left to fill in the gaps in the `1` block.
  - The `2`s at the bottom will move up to fill in the gaps in the `1` block.

### Final Output:

5521c0d9,"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the provided training examples and derive the transformation rule:

### Analysis of Training Examples

#### Example 1:
- **Input:** 
  - A grid with blocks of different colors.
  - Colors 1, 2, and 4 are present in the bottom part of the grid.
- **Output:**
  - The block of color 2 moves up by 4 rows.
  - The block of color 1 moves up by 1 row.
  - The block of color 4 remains in the same position but shifts down.

#### Example 2:
- **Input:**
  - A grid with blocks of colors 1, 2, and 4.
- **Output:**
  - The block of color 1 moves up by 5 rows.
  - The block of color 2 moves up by 2 rows.
  - The block of color 4 remains in the same position but shifts down.

#### Example 3:
- **Input:**
  - A grid with blocks of colors 1, 2, and 4.
- **Output:**
  - The block of color 1 moves up by 3 rows.
  - The block of color 2 moves up by 4 rows.
  - The block of color 4 remains in the same position but shifts down.

### General Transformation Rule:
- Each block of a specific color moves up by a certain number of rows.
- The number of rows a block moves up depends on the color:
  - Color 1: Moves up by 3 rows.
  - Color 2: Moves up by 4 rows.
  - Color 4: Remains in the same position but shifts down if necessary.

     [7, 1, 1, 7, 7, 8]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [1, 8, 8, 5, 5, 8],
     [1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8],
     [5, 1, 1, 5, 5, 8]
     ```
   - Observation: The number `7` is replaced with `5` in the output.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input:
     ```
     [7, 7, 7, 1],
     [1, 8, 1, 7],
     [7, 1, 1, 7]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [5, 5, 5, 1],
     [1, 8, 1, 5],
     [5, 1, 1, 5]
     ```
   - Observation: Again, the number `7` is replaced with `5`.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input:
     ```
     [1, 8, 1, 7, 1],
     [7, 8, 8, 1, 1],
     [7, 1, 8, 8, 7]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [1, 8, 1, 5, 1],
     [5, 8, 8, 1, 1],
     [5, 1, 8, 8, 5]
     ```
   - Observation: The number `7` is replaced with `5`.

From these observations, we can conclude that the transformation rule is to replace all occurrences of `7` with `5`.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

- **Test Case**:
  - Input:
    ```
    [1, 7, 7, 1, 7],
    [8, 1, 7, 7, 7],
    [8, 7, 1, 7, 8]
    ```

Applying the transformation rule (replacing `7` with `5`):

- Output:
  ```

  [8, 1, 5, 5, 5],
  [8, 5, 1, 5, 8]

508bd3b6,"To deduce the transformation rule, let's carefully analyze the pattern in the provided examples:

1. **Pattern Identification**:
   - In all examples, the number `8` serves as an anchor point.
   - Starting from the position of `8`, a diagonal line of `3`s is drawn moving diagonally upwards to the left.
   - The `3`s continue until they reach the edge of the grid or a row where there is no `8`.

2. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**:
   - Identify the positions of `8` in the test case grid.
   - Draw a diagonal line of `3`s starting from each `8` and moving diagonally upwards to the left.

Let's apply this to the test case:

- The first `8` is at position (0, 3).
  - Draw a diagonal line of `3`s starting from (0, 3) upwards to the left: (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0).

- The second `8` is at position (1, 4).
  - Draw a diagonal line of `3`s starting from (1, 4) upwards to the left: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0).

### Analysis:
- In all examples, the non-zero elements in the input grid are moved downwards, filling the bottom rows first.
- If there are multiple non-zero elements in the same column, they are stacked on top of each other in the same order they appear in the input.

1. **General Pattern**: In all examples, the value `5` remains unchanged.
2. **Surrounding Values**:
    - If a cell has a value other than `5`, it gets replaced by a value that is one more than the original value, but only if the neighboring cells (above, below, left, right) are not `5`.
    - If a cell is `0` and surrounded by `5`s, it becomes `6`.
    - If a cell is `1` and surrounded by `5`s, it becomes `7`.
    - If a cell is `2` and surrounded by `5`s, it becomes `8`.
    - If a cell is `3` and surrounded by `5`s, it becomes `9`.
    - If a cell is `4` and surrounded by `5`s, it becomes `9`.

3. **Non-`5` Cells**:
    - If a cell is `1`, it becomes `6`.
    - If a cell is `2`, it becomes `7`.
    - If a cell is `3`, it becomes `8`.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** The grid has `8` in certain positions and `2` in a few others.
   - **Output:** The `8`s are spread out in a checkerboard pattern, and the `2`s remain in their original positions.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Similar to Example 1, with `8`s and `2`s in specific positions.
   - **Output:** The `8`s are also spread out in a checkerboard pattern, and the `2`s remain in their original positions.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** The grid has `8`s in certain positions and `2`s in a few others.
   - **Output:** The `8`s are spread out in a different pattern, but still in a checkerboard-like manner, and the `2`s remain in their original positions.

### General Transformation Rule:
- The `8`s are spread out in a checkerboard pattern.
- The `2`s remain in their original positions.

1. **Observation**:
   - In all examples, certain areas in the grid are replaced with the number `6`.
   - These areas seem to be contiguous regions of `0`s.

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - In Example 1, the region of `0`s in the middle columns of the second and third rows are replaced with `6`s.
   - In Example 2, a contiguous region of `0`s in the last two rows of the 15th, 16th, and 17th columns are replaced with `6`s.
   - In Example 3, a contiguous region of `0`s in the first row from the 3rd to the 7th columns are replaced with `6`s.
   - In Example 4, a contiguous region of `0`s in the last three rows from the 18th to the 20th columns are replaced with `6`s.

3. **Transformation Rule**:
   - Replace all contiguous regions of `0`s with `6`s.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],

]
```

Identify the contiguous regions of `0`s:
- First row: Columns 1-4 and 16-19.
- Second row: Columns 2-5 and 18.
- Third row: Columns 1-5 and 13-14.
- Fourth row: Columns 1-2 and 7-9 and 18-20.

Replace these regions with `6`s:

```python
[
[6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],

   - Observations: The first two rows of the output have `2` where the input has `0` in the same positions, and the rest are `0`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:

### Transformation Rule:
- The transformation rule appears to be that the first three rows of the output are derived from the first three rows of the input.
- In these first three rows, any `0` in the input is replaced by `2` in the output, and all other values are set to `0`.

- Apply the rule:
  - First row: `[9, 0, 9]` -> `[0, 2, 0]`
  - Second row: `[0, 0, 9]` -> `[2, 2, 0]`
  - Third row: `[9, 0, 9]` -> `[0, 2, 0]`

a65b410d,"First, let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided examples:

1. The block of '2's in the input is located in the upper part of the grid.
2. In the output, a pattern of '3's appears above the '2's, forming a triangular shape that decreases in width until it reaches the top row.
3. Below the '2's, there is a triangular pattern of '1's that decreases in width as it moves down towards the bottom.

Let's summarize the rule:
- For each row above the row containing the block of '2's, fill the beginning of the row with a decreasing number of '3's.
- For each row below the row containing the block of '2's, fill the beginning of the row with a decreasing number of '1's.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

```

Output:
- Row 1: Fill the first 5 cells with '3' (since the block of '2's has 5 cells)
- Row 2: Fill the first 4 cells with '3'
- Row 3: Keep the block of '2's as is
- Row 4: Fill the first 4 cells with '1'
- Row 5: Fill the first 3 cells with '1'
- Row 6: Fill the first 2 cells with '1'
- Row 7: Fill the first 1 cell with '1'

5117e062,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids. Let's analyze the examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: A grid with a pattern of 3s and 4s.
   - Output: A smaller grid with a pattern of 4s.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: A grid with a pattern of 2s and 3s.
   - Output: A smaller grid with a pattern of 3s.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: A grid with a pattern of 2s and 3s.
   - Output: A smaller grid with a pattern of 2s.

From these observations, it seems that the transformation involves extracting a specific pattern from the input grid and reducing it to a smaller grid. Specifically, the output grid appears to be a 3x3 grid centered around the main pattern in the input grid.

ba26e723,"To figure out the transformation rule, let's carefully analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the provided examples:

1. **Identify the Pattern**:
   - In all examples, cells that contain `4` are sometimes changed to `6`.
   - The pattern seems to be that `4` is changed to `6` if it is in a position where it alternates with `0` in the same row.

2. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - In Example 1:
     - First row: `4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0` becomes `6, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 4, 0`
     - Second row: `4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4` becomes `6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6`
     - Third row: `0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4` becomes `0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 6`

   - In Example 2:
     - First row: `0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0` becomes `0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0`
     - Second row: `4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4` becomes `6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4`
     - Third row: `4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4` becomes `6, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 4`

   - The pattern is consistent across all examples. `4` is changed to `6` if it is in an alternating position with `0` in the same row.

3. **Apply the Rule to the Test Case**:
   - First row: `0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0` becomes `0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0`
   - Second row: `4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4` becomes `6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4`

   - In the output, the middle rows of the shape composed of `2`s are replaced with `8`s.
   - The middle rows of the shape composed of `3`s are also replaced with `8`s.
   - The middle rows of the shape composed of `1`s are replaced with `8`s, but only in the middle columns.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each shape (a contiguous block of the same number), the middle rows of the shape are replaced with `8`s, while the edge rows remain unchanged.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

```python
[
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]
]
```

Applying the transformation rule:

1. **Shape of `1`s**:
   - Middle rows (rows 1, 2, 3) are replaced with `8`s in the middle columns (columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

2. **Shape of `2`s**:
   - Middle rows (rows 7, 8, 9, 10) are replaced with `8`s in the middle columns (columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).

3. **Shape of `3`s**:
   - Middle rows (rows 8, 9, 10, 11) are replaced with `8`s in the middle columns (columns 10, 11, 12, 13).

The resulting grid is:

### Example 1 Analysis:
- **Input**: A 10x10 grid with a central block of `8`s and some other numbers inside.
- **Output**: The `8`s remain unchanged, but the numbers `4`, `3`, `2`, and `6` are moved to the edges of the grid. Specifically:
  - `4` moves to the bottom row, 8th column.
  - `3` moves to the top row, 3rd column.
  - `2` moves to the bottom row, 6th column.
  - `6` moves to the top row, 7th column.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input**: A 10x10 grid with a central block of `7`s and some other numbers inside.
- **Output**: The `7`s remain unchanged, but the numbers `2`, `8`, `3`, and `9` are moved to the edges of the grid. Specifically:
  - `2` moves to the bottom row, 8th column.
  - `8` moves to the top row, 2nd column.
  - `3` moves to the bottom row, 7th column.
  - `9` moves to the top row, 9th column.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- **Input**: A 10x10 grid with a central block of `1`s and some other numbers inside.
- **Output**: The `1`s remain unchanged, but the numbers `2`, `3`, `5`, and `6` are moved to the edges of the grid. Specifically:
  - `2` moves to the bottom row, 8th column.
  - `3` moves to the top row, 2nd column.
  - `5` moves to the top row, 7th column.
  - `6` moves to the bottom row, 1st column.

### General Rule:
- The numbers inside the central block (which is surrounded by zeros) are moved to the edges of the grid.
- The order in which they appear on the edges seems to be from left to right and top to bottom.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input**:

- **Output**:
  - The `3`s remain unchanged.
  - The numbers `6`, `4`, `8`, and `2` are moved to the edges of the grid.
  - Following the pattern:
    - `6` moves to the top row, 4th column.
    - `4` moves to the top row, 7th column.
    - `8` moves to the bottom row, 3rd column.
    - `2` moves to the bottom row, 7th column.

c3e719e8,"To solve the test case, we need to figure out the transformation rule used in the training examples.

### Observations:
1. **Size Increase**: The output grid is always 3 times larger than the input grid.
2. **Pattern Replication**: Each cell of the input grid is replicated into a 3x3 block in the output grid.
3. **Positioning**: The replication seems to follow a pattern where the 3x3 blocks are placed in a specific order within the larger grid.

### Transformation Rule:
- Each cell \((i, j)\) in the input grid is expanded into a 3x3 block in the output grid.
- The 3x3 block is placed at positions \((3i, 3j)\) in the output grid.
- The 3x3 block is repeated in a 3x3 grid pattern within the larger output grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
Given the input grid:
```
[
[1, 1, 7],
[7, 4, 1],
[5, 1, 7]
]
```

We will expand each cell into a 3x3 block and place them accordingly in the output grid.

#### Step-by-Step Expansion:
1. **First Row**:
   - Cell (0, 0): 1 → 3x3 block of 1s
   - Cell (0, 1): 1 → 3x3 block of 1s
   - Cell (0, 2): 7 → 3x3 block of 7s

2. **Second Row**:
   - Cell (1, 0): 7 → 3x3 block of 7s
   - Cell (1, 1): 4 → 3x3 block of 4s
   - Cell (1, 2): 1 → 3x3 block of 1s

3. **Third Row**:
   - Cell (2, 0): 5 → 3x3 block of 5s
   - Cell (2, 1): 1 → 3x3 block of 1s
   - Cell (2, 2): 7 → 3x3 block of 7s

623ea044,"To determine the transformation rule applied in the examples, let's analyze the patterns:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input has a single non-zero value `2` at position `(3, 3)`.
   - Output has a pattern where the value `2` forms a cross centered around the original position `(3, 3)` and extends diagonally to the edges of the grid.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input has a single non-zero value `7` at position `(5, 11)`.
   - Output has a pattern where the value `7` forms a cross centered around the original position `(5, 11)` and extends diagonally to the edges of the grid.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input has a single non-zero value `8` at position `(3, 2)`.
   - Output has a pattern where the value `8` forms a cross centered around the original position `(3, 2)` and extends diagonally to the edges of the grid.

From these examples, we can deduce that the transformation rule is:
- For each non-zero value in the input grid, create a cross pattern centered at that value.
- The cross extends diagonally to the edges of the grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case:**
- Input has a single non-zero value `6` at position `(7, 12)`.

We need to create a cross pattern centered at `(7, 12)` and extend it diagonally to the edges of the grid.

Here is the step-by-step transformation:

1. Start with the input grid.
2. Place the value `6` in the center of the cross at `(7, 12)`.
3. Extend the cross diagonally to the edges of the grid.

The resulting grid will be:

1. **Color Block Identification**:
   - The input contains blocks of the same color (e.g., `1, 1` or `2, 2`).

2. **Transformation Rule**:
   - For each block of the same color, a `1` is added to the grid in a diagonal pattern starting from the top-left corner of the block and moving down to the bottom-right corner.
   - The `1` is placed such that it forms a diagonal line leading up to the block.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

### Test Case Analysis

- **Block of 1s**:
  - Located at positions (4,6) and (5,6).
  - Diagonal `1`s should start from the top-left of the block and move down to the bottom-right.
  - Starting from (3,3) to (4,4) and (5,5).

- **Block of 2s**:
  - Located at positions (6,2) and (7,2).
  - Diagonal `1`s should start from the top-left of the block and move down to the bottom-right.
  - Starting from (5,1) to (6,2) and (7,3).

- In all examples, the size of the output grid is three times the size of the input grid.
- Each cell in the input grid is repeated in a 3x3 block in the output grid.

To confirm this, let's break down the first example:
- Input: 
  ```
  [
  [0, 7, 7],
  [7, 7, 7],
  [0, 7, 7]]
  ```
- Output:
  ```

  ```

Each element in the input grid is expanded into a 3x3 block in the output grid. For example, the `0` in the top-left corner of the input becomes a 3x3 block of `0`s in the top-left corner of the output grid.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[7, 0, 7],
[7, 0, 7],
[7, 7, 0]]
```

We will expand each element into a 3x3 block:

- The `7` in the top-left corner becomes:
  ```
  [7, 7, 7]
  [7, 7, 7]
  [7, 7, 7]
  ```

- The `0` next to it becomes:
  ```
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 0]
  ```

- The `7` in the top-right corner becomes:
  ```
  [7, 7, 7]
  [7, 7, 7]
  [7, 7, 7]

- The output grid is always three times the height of the input grid.
- The `1`s in the input grid are replaced by `2`s in the output grid, and the pattern of `2`s is repeated in a 3x3 block.

f25fbde4,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: A 9x9 grid with a 4x4 square of 4s in the middle.
  - Output: A 6x8 grid with a 4x4 square of 4s in the middle, but the grid is cropped to remove the outermost rows and columns that do not contain any 4s.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: A 9x9 grid with a 4x4 L-shaped structure of 4s in the top-left corner.
  - Output: A 6x6 grid with the same L-shaped structure of 4s, but the grid is cropped to remove the outermost rows and columns that do not contain any 4s.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: A 9x9 grid with a 4x4 T-shaped structure of 4s.
  - Output: A 8x6 grid with the same T-shaped structure of 4s, but the grid is cropped to remove the outermost rows and columns that do not contain any 4s.

From these examples, we can deduce the transformation rule:
- The output grid is formed by cropping the input grid to include only the rows and columns that contain at least one non-zero value (in this case, 4s).
- The resulting grid maintains the relative positions of the non-zero values.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

- **Test Case**:
  - Input: A 9x9 grid with a 4x4 cross-shaped structure of 4s in the center.

We need to crop this grid to include only the rows and columns that contain 4s. The non-zero values form a cross shape in the middle of the grid. Let's identify the range of rows and columns that contain 4s:
- Rows containing 4s: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Columns containing 4s: 4, 5, 6, 7

Cropping the grid to these rows and columns, we get:
- Row 1: [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0]
- Row 2: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4]
- Row 3: [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0]
- Row 4: [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0]

9af7a82c,"To deduce the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the provided training examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: A 3x3 grid with colors [2, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1], [1, 1, 1].
   - Output: A 5x3 grid with colors [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 0], [1, 2, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0].

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: A 3x4 grid with colors [3, 1, 1, 4], [2, 2, 2, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4].
   - Output: A 6x4 grid with colors [4, 2, 1, 3], [4, 2, 1, 0], [4, 2, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0].

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: A 4x3 grid with colors [8, 8, 2], [3, 8, 8], [3, 3, 4], [3, 3, 4].
   - Output: A 5x4 grid with colors [3, 8, 4, 2], [3, 8, 4, 0], [3, 8, 0, 0], [3, 8, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0].

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: A 4x3 grid with colors [1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 8, 1], [2, 8, 1].

From these examples, we can observe the following pattern:
- The output grid has a fixed number of rows (5 rows in Example 1, 6 rows in Examples 2 and 4, 5 rows in Example 3).
- The first row of the output grid contains the unique colors from the input grid, sorted in descending order.
- The subsequent rows are filled with the first color in the sorted list, followed by zeros until the end of the row.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case**:
- Input: A 4x4 grid with colors [8, 8, 2, 2], [1, 8, 8, 2], [1, 3, 3, 4], [1, 1, 1, 1].

**Step-by-Step Solution**:
1. Identify the unique colors in the input grid: [8, 2, 1, 3, 4].
2. Sort these colors in descending order: [8, 4, 3, 2, 1].
3. Create the first row of the output grid using these sorted colors: [8, 4, 3, 2, 1].
4. Fill the remaining rows with the first color (8) followed by zeros.

The output grid will be:

ec883f72,"To determine the transformation rule that applies to these grids, let's analyze the examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input has clusters of numbers (3s and 9s) with 0s around them.
   - Output shows that the 3s remain in place, but additional 3s appear in the bottom-right corner.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input has clusters of 8s and a single 6 in the middle.
   - Output shows that the 8s remain in place, but additional 6s appear in a diagonal pattern starting from the bottom-left corner.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input has a large cluster of 4s and a smaller cluster of 2s.
   - Output shows that the 4s and 2s remain in place, but additional 2s appear in a diagonal pattern starting from the bottom-left corner.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input has clusters of 5s and 4s.
   - Output shows that the 5s remain in place, but additional 4s appear in a diagonal pattern starting from the bottom-left corner.

From these observations, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- Any non-zero number that appears in the input remains in its original position.
- Additional instances of the smallest non-zero number in the grid are added in a diagonal pattern starting from the bottom-left corner of the grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

9172f3a0,"Let's analyze the transformation rule based on the given examples:

### Example 1 Analysis:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [3, 3, 0],
  [7, 4, 0],
  [0, 0, 4]]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]]
  ```

### Transformation Rule:
- Each cell in the input grid is repeated 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically.
- For example, the cell `[3]` in the top-left corner becomes a 3x3 block of `3`s in the output.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [3, 0, 2],
  [0, 2, 2],
  [0, 0, 3]]
  ```
- **Output:**

### Observations:
1. **Color Change:** The number `1` in the input seems to change to either `0` or `2` in the output.
2. **Pattern:** The number `1` changes to `2` if it is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to another `1`. If it is not adjacent to any other `1`, it changes to `0`.
3. **Other Colors:** All other numbers remain unchanged.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

### Step-by-Step Transformation:
1. **First Row:** The `1` at (0,8) is not adjacent to any other `1`, so it changes to `0`.
2. **Second Row:** The `1`s at (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9) are all adjacent to each other, so they change to `2`.
3. **Third Row:** The `1`s at (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), and (2,8) are all adjacent to each other, so they change to `2`.
4. **Fourth Row:** The `1`s at (3,1), (3,3) are adjacent to each other, so they change to `2`.
5. **Fifth Row:** The `1`s at (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) are all adjacent to each other, so they change to `2`.
6. **Sixth Row:** No `1`s, so no changes.
7. **Seventh Row:** The `1`s at (6,6) and (6,7) are adjacent to each other, so they change to `2`.
8. **Eighth Row:** The `1`s at (7,1), (7,2), (7,3) are all adjacent to each other, so they change to `2`.
9. **Ninth Row:** The `1`s at (8,1), (8,3), (8,8), and (8,9) are all adjacent to each other, so they change to `2`.
10. **Tenth Row:** The `1`s at (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,8), and (9,9) are all adjacent to each other, so they change to `2`.

d22278a0,"To determine the transformation rule, let's break down the patterns observed in the training examples:

1. **Color Propagation**: Each non-zero value (color) propagates to form a pattern. For instance, if there is a `1` at the top left corner, it forms a diagonal pattern downwards.
2. **Alternating Colors**: For each color, it alternates with zero. This means if a cell has a color, the next cell might have zero or another color depending on the propagation pattern.
3. **Boundary and Overlap**: When two different colors propagate, they can overlap, and the resulting pattern depends on the order of their appearance.

Let's apply these observations to the test case:

### Test Case Analysis
- **Initial Grid**:
  - Top-left corner has a `4`.
  - Bottom-right corner has an `8` and a `1`.

### Step-by-Step Transformation
1. **Color 4 Propagation**:
   - Start from the top-left corner and propagate diagonally downwards.
   - Alternate with zero.

2. **Color 8 Propagation**:
   - Start from the bottom-right corner and propagate diagonally upwards.
   - Alternate with zero.

3. **Color 1 Propagation**:
   - Start from the bottom-right corner and propagate diagonally upwards.
   - Alternate with zero.

### Applying the Rules
- **Top-Left 4 Propagation**:
  - Diagonal pattern starting from (0,0) and moving downwards.
  - Pattern: [4, 0, 4, 0, ...]

- **Bottom-Right 8 and 1 Propagation**:
  - Diagonal pattern starting from (16,16) and moving upwards.
  - Pattern: [8, 0, 8, 0, ..., 1, 0, 1, 0, ...]

### Final Output
Combining these patterns, we get:

1f642eb9,"To identify the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input has a single block of `8`s.
   - Output shows that the first `8` in the block is replaced by the color of the cell directly above it if that cell is not zero.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input has multiple blocks of `8`s.
   - Output shows that the first `8` in each block is replaced by the color of the cell directly above it if that cell is not zero.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input has multiple blocks of `8`s.
   - Output follows the same pattern as Example 2.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each block of `8`s, replace the first `8` in the block with the color of the cell directly above it if that cell is not zero.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Applying the rule:
- In row 4, the first `8` is replaced by `9` (from the cell above).
- In row 5, the first `8` is replaced by `0` (no change since the cell above is `0`).
- In row 6, the first `8` is replaced by `3` (from the cell above).
- In row 7, the first `8` is replaced by `4` (from the cell above).

### Observations:
1. The output is always a 3x3 grid.
2. The 3x3 grid is extracted from a specific region in the input grid.
3. The region seems to be centered around a specific pattern or feature in the input grid.

### Hypothesis:
The 3x3 grid is extracted from the center of the largest connected component of 8s in the input grid.

### Test Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8],
  [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 1],
  [1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8],
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8]
  ```

### Solution:
1. Identify the largest connected component of 8s.
2. Extract the 3x3 grid centered around this component.

The largest connected component of 8s is in the top-left corner. The 3x3 grid centered around this component is:
```
[8, 8, 8],
[8, 8, 8],
[1, 8, 8]
```

However, the pattern suggests that the 3x3 grid should be centered around the most central part of the connected component. The correct 3x3 grid is:
```
[8, 1, 8],
[1, 8, 1],
[8, 1, 8]
```

a68b268e,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples carefully:

1. **Grid Structure**: 
   - All input grids have a central row of `1`s, which acts as a divider.
   - The output grids are smaller, typically 4x4.

2. **Content of Output Grid**:
   - The output grid seems to be composed of elements from the top and bottom parts of the input grid, but only from certain rows and columns.

3. **Positioning**:
   - The elements in the output grid appear to be taken from specific positions relative to the central row of `1`s.

4. **Transformation Rule**:
   - The output grid is formed by taking elements from the rows immediately above and below the central row of `1`s.
   - Specifically, the output grid takes the following elements:
     - Top-left element: From the second row above the central row, first column.
     - Top-right element: From the second row above the central row, fourth column.
     - Bottom-left element: From the second row below the central row, first column.
     - Bottom-right element: From the second row below the central row, fourth column.
   - The middle two elements are taken from the row immediately above and below the central row, respectively, at the same columns as the top and bottom elements.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case Input**:

[8, 0, 8, 0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6],
[0, 8, 0, 8, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0]]
```

**Output Calculation**:
- Top-left element: Row 2, Column 1 -> 7
- Top-right element: Row 2, Column 4 -> 0
- Bottom-left element: Row 7, Column 1 -> 8
- Bottom-right element: Row 7, Column 4 -> 0

- Middle elements:
  - Row 3, Column 1 -> 7
  - Row 3, Column 4 -> 7
  - Row 6, Column 1 -> 0
  - Row 6, Column 4 -> 8

Thus, the output grid is:

85c4e7cd,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the transformation rule applied in the training examples. Observing the patterns:

1. The outermost border of the grid is replaced with the value that appears in the center of the innermost layer.
2. Each subsequent layer inward is shifted by one position, and the value in the new outermost layer is the value that was originally in the next inner layer.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

### Step-by-Step Transformation

1. **Identify the outermost layer value:**
   - The outermost layer is all 8s.
   - The value in the center of the innermost layer is 5 (from the innermost 5x5 grid).

2. **Replace the outermost layer with the center value:**
   - Replace all 8s in the outermost layer with 5.

3. **Shift the inner layers:**
   - Shift the next inner layer (all 2s) outward by one position.
   - Continue this process for all inner layers.

- For any cell containing an `8`, a cross pattern of `5`s is formed around it, extending one cell in all four directions (up, down, left, right).

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input**: A single `8` is placed in the 6th row, 6th column.
- **Output**:
  - The `8` remains in its original position.
  - A ""cross"" pattern of `5`s forms around the `8`, extending one cell in all four directions.

Let's construct the output grid based on this rule:

ea786f4a,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the training examples:

1. In Example 1, the input has a zero in the center, and the output is a grid where the cells that were 1s in the original grid remain 1s if they are adjacent to the center cell; otherwise, they become 0s.
2. In Example 2, the input has a zero surrounded by 2s. The output shows that the 2s directly adjacent to the zero remain 2s, while other 2s become 0s.
3. In Example 3, the pattern continues with a zero in the center of a larger grid. The 3s directly adjacent to the zero remain 3s, while others become 0s.

The consistent rule across these examples is that any cell that is not directly adjacent (including diagonally) to the zero in the input grid becomes a zero in the output grid. Cells that are directly adjacent (including diagonally) to the zero retain their value.

Applying this rule to the test case, we find the zero at position [5][5] in a grid of 6s. We need to keep the 6s that are directly adjacent to the zero and set all other 6s to 0.

a78176bb,"To solve the puzzle, I need to understand the transformation rule applied in the training examples.

### Analysis of the Transformation Rule:

- **Observation 1:** The primary value (not zero) in the input is shifted diagonally in the output.
- **Observation 2:** The primary value appears in a pattern that resembles a diagonal line, but it also seems to shift positions based on its original location.
- **Observation 3:** The primary value (e.g., 7, 9, 2) moves to the next diagonal position in the output, wrapping around if necessary.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Identify the Primary Value:** In the input, the primary value is 1.
2. **Diagonal Shift:** The primary value 1 shifts diagonally to the next position in the output. If the primary value is at position (i, j) in the input, it moves to position (j, i) in the output.
3. **Wrap Around:** If the primary value reaches the edge of the grid, it wraps around to the beginning of the next row or column.

### Applying the Transformation to the Test Case:

- **Input Grid:**
  ```

  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [6, 6, 6],

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [0, 0, 9],
     [0, 0, 9],

   - Observation: The first column remains the same, and the second and third columns have been swapped with the second column becoming zeros.

### General Rule:
- The first column remains unchanged.
- The second and third columns are swapped, and the second column becomes zeros.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- Input:
  ```

### Analysis of Training Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** A grid with two shapes: one of color 2 and one of color 7.
   - **Output:** A smaller grid containing only the shape of color 6.
   - **Observation:** The output contains only the shape that is not present in the input but is the last non-zero color in the sequence (6).

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** A grid with two shapes: one of color 4 and one of color 8.
   - **Output:** A smaller grid containing only the shape of color 4.
   - **Observation:** The output contains only the shape that is not the last non-zero color in the sequence (8), but the first non-zero color (4).

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** A grid with three shapes: one of color 3, one of color 5, and one of color 8.
   - **Output:** A smaller grid containing only the shape of color 5.
   - **Observation:** The output contains only the shape that is not the last non-zero color in the sequence (8), but the middle non-zero color (5).

### General Rule:
- The output grid contains only the shape that is not the last non-zero color in the sequence, but rather the first or middle non-zero color, depending on the number of different colors present.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input:** A grid with three shapes: one of color 3, one of color 9, and one of color 4.
- **Non-zero colors:** 3, 9, 4.
- **Last non-zero color:** 4.
- **Middle non-zero color:** 9.
- **First non-zero color:** 3.

Since the rule seems to favor the first non-zero color when there are multiple colors, the output will contain only the shape of color 3.

### Extracting the Shape of Color 3:
- The shape of color 3 is located in rows 2, 3, and 4, and columns 6 to 9.

e76a88a6,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let's analyze the provided examples:

### Example 1:
- **Input:** The grid contains regions of different colors.
- **Output:** The regions of colors seem to shift positions while maintaining their shapes and sizes.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** Similar to Example 1, the grid contains regions of different colors.
- **Output:** The regions of colors also shift positions while maintaining their shapes and sizes.

### Observations:
1. The regions of colors (e.g., 2, 4, 5, 6, 8) move to new positions in the output grid.
2. The movement seems to be a rotation of the regions around the center of the grid.
3. The background (0) remains unchanged.

### Hypothesis:
The transformation rule is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the regions within the grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
Let's apply the 90-degree clockwise rotation to the test case input grid:

#### Test Case Input:
```
[

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]

#### Step-by-Step Rotation:
1. Identify the regions and their boundaries.
2. Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise.

After performing the 90-degree clockwise rotation:

60b61512,"To solve the test case, let's first understand the pattern from the training examples:

### Analysis:
1. **Color Change**: In both examples, the color `4` is sometimes changed to `7`. This suggests there might be a specific condition or pattern that triggers this change.
2. **Pattern of Change**: 
   - In Example 1, a `4` changes to `7` if it has a `4` directly adjacent to it (horizontally or vertically).
   - In Example 2, the same pattern is observed: a `4` changes to `7` if it has a `4` directly adjacent to it.

### Rule:
- If a cell with value `4` has a neighboring cell (up, down, left, right) also with value `4`, then the cell changes to `7`.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
Let's apply this rule to the test case:

```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
]
```

- The `4` at position (1, 4) does not have any adjacent `4`s.
- The `4`s at positions (2, 3) and (2, 4) are adjacent to each other, so they both change to `7`.
- The `4` at position (2, 2) is adjacent to the `4` at (2, 3), so it changes to `7`.
- The `4` at position (3, 2) is adjacent to the `4` at (2, 2), so it changes to `7`.
- The `4` at position (7, 6) is adjacent to the `4` at (7, 7), so it changes to `7`.
- The `4` at position (7, 7) is adjacent to the `4` at (7, 6) and (7, 8), so it changes to `7`.
- The `4` at position (7, 8) is adjacent to the `4` at (7, 7), so it changes to `7`.
- The `4` at position (8, 6) is adjacent to the `4` at (7, 6), so it changes to `7`.

67e8384a,"To understand the transformation rule applied in the examples, let's break down the process:

1. **Symmetry**: Each output grid is symmetric both horizontally and vertically.
2. **Pattern Replication**: The original input grid is used to form a larger pattern by mirroring the rows and columns.

### Steps to Derive the Rule:
- **Horizontal Mirroring**: The rows of the input grid are mirrored to form the top half of the output grid.
- **Vertical Mirroring**: The entire top half (including the middle row) is mirrored to form the bottom half of the output grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
Given the input:
```
[
[1, 6, 6],
[5, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2]
]
```

1. **Horizontal Mirroring**:
   - First row: [1, 6, 6] becomes [1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1]
   - Second row: [5, 2, 2] becomes [5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5]
   - Third row: [2, 2, 2] becomes [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

2. **Vertical Mirroring**:
   - Top half: 
     ```
     [1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1]
     [5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5]
     [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
     ```
   - Bottom half (mirror of the top half):
     ```
     [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
     [5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5]
     [1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1]
     ```

Combining these, the final output grid is:
```

### Example 1:
- **Input:** A grid with mostly 8s and a few 0s and 2s.
- **Output:** The 2s in the input remain unchanged, but additional 2s are added around them in a cross pattern.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** A grid with mostly 1s and a few 0s and 3s.
- **Output:** The 3s in the input remain unchanged, but additional 3s are added around them in a cross pattern.

### Example 3:
- **Input:** A grid with mostly 4s and a few 0s and 8s.
- **Output:** The 8s in the input remain unchanged, but additional 8s are added around them in a cross pattern.

### General Rule:
- For any number \( n \) in the grid:
  - If \( n \) is present in the input, additional \( n \)'s are added around it in a cross pattern (up, down, left, right).

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input:** A grid with mostly 3s and a few 6s and 0s.
- **Transformation:**
  - The 6s in the input remain unchanged, and additional 6s are added around them in a cross pattern.
  - The 0s in the input remain unchanged, and no additional 0s are added around them.

3428a4f5,"To solve the puzzle, we need to identify the transformation rule that converts the input grid to the output grid based on the provided examples.

### Observations:
1. **Row Reduction**: The number of rows in the output is reduced compared to the input. Specifically, the output has 6 rows, while the input has more.
2. **Pattern Matching**: The pattern of `2`s and `0`s in the input seems to influence the placement of `3`s in the output.
3. **Row Merging**: It appears that every two rows in the input are combined into one row in the output. For example, in Example 1, the first two rows `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2]` and `[0, 0, 2, 0, 2]` are combined to form `[3, 0, 0, 3, 3]`.

### Transformation Rule:
- **Combining Rows**: Each pair of rows in the input is combined into one row in the output.
- **Value Mapping**:
  - If both corresponding cells in the two rows contain `2`, the output cell is `3`.
  - If one cell contains `2` and the other contains `0`, the output cell is `3` if the `2` is in the first row, and `0` if the `2` is in the second row.
  - If both cells contain `0`, the output cell is `0`.

ef135b50,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

- **Example 1** shows that where there is a gap (0) between two groups of 2s, these gaps are filled with 9s.
- **Example 2** confirms this pattern, showing that 9s are used to fill gaps between 2s.
- **Example 3** further reinforces this, indicating that 9s are used to fill gaps even when they are not directly adjacent to the 2s.

Given this pattern, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- For each row, if there is a sequence of 2s followed by a sequence of 0s, followed by another sequence of 2s, replace the 0s in the middle with 9s.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

99b1bc43,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the transformation rule that was applied in the training examples. Let's analyze the patterns:

1. **Common Structure**:
   - The output grid is always 4x4.
   - The input grid has a row of 4s in the middle, which seems to act as a boundary.

2. **Transformation Rules**:
   - The output grid is derived from the top-left 4x4 subgrid of the input grid.
   - Any 1 in the top-left 4x4 subgrid of the input grid is transformed to 3 in the output grid.
   - Any other number (0 or 2) in the top-left 4x4 subgrid of the input grid remains unchanged in the output grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

bc1d5164,"By observing the provided examples, we can deduce that the transformation involves extracting a 3x3 subgrid from the original grid. This subgrid appears to be centered around the central non-zero element of the largest possible cross formed by non-zero elements in the input grid.

Let's break down the pattern:

- In each example, the output is a 3x3 grid.
- The center of the 3x3 grid in the output corresponds to the central non-zero element of the largest cross in the input grid.
- The surrounding elements in the 3x3 grid match the corresponding elements in the input grid around the central non-zero element.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]
```

The largest cross is formed by the 1s in the following positions:
- (1, 0)
- (4, 1)
- (4, 6)

The central non-zero element of the largest cross is at position (4, 1). We extract a 3x3 subgrid centered around this element:

```
[
[1, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 1]

   - **Output**: The 5s move down one row. Specifically, (0,4) moves to (5,4), (1,4) moves to (6,4), and (13,3) to (13,5) move to (9,3) to (9,5).

2. **Example 2**:
   - **Input**: The 5s are located at (7,1), (7,2), (8,1), (8,2), (9,13), and (10,13).

67a3c6ac,"To understand the transformation rule used in these examples, let's analyze the changes from the input to the output:

1. In Example 1:
   - The number `2` seems to move to the first position in every row.
   - Other numbers shift to the right, with the last number wrapping around to the second position.

2. In Example 2:
   - Similarly, the number `2` moves to the first position in every row.
   - Other numbers shift accordingly, maintaining the pattern observed in Example 1.

3. In Example 3:
   - The same pattern is followed: the number `2` moves to the first position in every row, and all other numbers shift to the right.

Given this consistent pattern across all examples, we can deduce that the transformation rule is:
- For each row, find the first occurrence of `2`.
- Move this `2` to the beginning of the row.
- Shift all other elements one position to the right, wrapping the last element to the second position.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Input:
```
[
[7, 6, 1],
[6, 7, 6],
[6, 2, 2]
]
```

Step-by-step transformation:
1. First row `[7, 6, 1]`:
   - No `2` present, so no change.
   - Result: `[7, 6, 1]`

2. Second row `[6, 7, 6]`:
   - No `2` present, so no change.
   - Result: `[6, 7, 6]`

3. Third row `[6, 2, 2]`:
   - First `2` found at index 1.
   - Move `2` to the beginning: `[2, 6, 2]`.

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: A 10x10 grid with two distinct shapes: a 4x4 square of 7s and an 8x8 square of 8s.
   - Output: A 2x2 grid containing 8s.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: A 10x10 grid with two distinct shapes: a 4x4 square of 6s and an 8x8 square of 7s.
   - Output: A 2x2 grid containing 7s.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: A 10x10 grid with two distinct shapes: a 7x7 square of 4s and a 3x3 square of 2s.
   - Output: A 2x2 grid containing 4s.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:
- The output grid is always a 2x2 grid.
- The values in the output grid correspond to the color of the larger shape in the input grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case**:
- Input: A 10x10 grid with two distinct shapes: a 9x5 rectangle of 3s and a 10x5 rectangle of 9s.
- The larger shape in the input grid is the 10x5 rectangle of 9s.

Therefore, the output should be a 2x2 grid with all values being 9.

6d0160f0,"To solve the puzzle, let's analyze the transformation rules based on the provided examples:

1. **Observation of Rows with All 5s:**
   - In each example, there’s at least one row that consists entirely of the number 5.
   - This row remains unchanged in the output.

2. **Transformation of Other Rows:**
   - For rows that do not consist entirely of 5s, the transformation seems to set all elements to 0 except those that are 5s.
   - Additionally, some non-5 elements in these rows are retained in the output. These elements appear to be the first non-5 element encountered when scanning from left to right in the row.

3. **Summary of Transformation Rule:**
   - If a row contains only 5s, it remains unchanged.
   - If a row contains other values, all elements are set to 0 except for the first non-5 element encountered from left to right, which is retained.

- **Input:** 
  - The grid has a 5x5 square of `5`s, an isolated `6` at position (2,7) and (2,8), and a `7` at (0,8) and (0,9).
- **Output:** 
  - The `6`s have moved to positions (8,7) and (8,8). The rest of the grid remains unchanged.
  
### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input:** 
  - The grid has a 3x3 square of `3`s, a 4x4 square of `9`s, and a `6` at position (4,7) and (4,9).
- **Output:** 
  - The `3`s have replaced the `0`s inside the 5s' region, and the `9`s have replaced the `0`s inside the 5s' region.

- **Output:** 
  - The `2`s have replaced the `0`s inside the 5s' region, and the `8`s have replaced the `0`s inside the 5s' region.

### General Rule:
- **Observation:**
  - In all examples, the pattern seems to involve replacing `0`s within a specific region with another color.
  - The region is defined by the boundary of a different color (e.g., `5` or `7`).

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Test Case Input:**
  - The grid has:

    - A 3x3 square of `2`s.
    - A 3x3 square of `7`s.
    - A 4x4 square of `4`s.

- **Transformation:**
  - Replace the `0`s within the 5s' region with `2`s.
  - Replace the `0`s within the 7s' region with `2`s.
  - Replace the `0`s within the 4s' region with `4`s.

5168d44c,"To solve the test case, let's first analyze the pattern observed in the training examples:

1. In Example 1, the pattern is that the rows containing non-zero elements move one row down.
2. In Example 2, the pattern is similar to Example 1, where the rows with non-zero elements move one row down.
3. In Example 3, the pattern is also consistent with the previous examples, where the rows with non-zero elements move one row down.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Shift all rows containing non-zero elements one row down.
- The topmost row becomes a row of zeros.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

Applying the transformation rule:
- Shift the rows containing non-zero elements one row down.
- The topmost row becomes a row of zeros.

Output:
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

dbc1a6ce,"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the transformation rule based on the provided examples:

1. **Identify the Pattern**:
   - In the output, cells that have a `1` in the input remain `1`.
   - Cells that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a `1` in the input are filled with an `8`.

2. **Apply the Rule**:
   - For each cell in the input grid that contains a `1`, check all its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
   - If an adjacent cell is `0`, change it to `8`.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

22233c11,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The original grid has some `3`s scattered randomly.
   - The output grid shows that `8`s are placed around the `3`s, specifically in positions where there are no `3`s but are adjacent to a `3`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The original grid has a block of `3`s forming a 2x2 square and another 2x2 square.
   - The output grid shows that `8`s are placed around the blocks of `3`s, again in positions where there are no `3`s but are adjacent to a `3`.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The original grid has two isolated `3`s.
   - The output grid shows that `8`s are placed around these `3`s, in positions where there are no `3`s but are adjacent to a `3`.

From these observations, we can infer the transformation rule:
- For each `3` in the input grid, place an `8` in all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that do not already contain a `3`.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

### Test Case

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

### Applying the Transformation Rule
- We need to place `8`s around each `3` in the grid.

Let's go through each `3` and place `8`s around it:

- The `3`s at positions (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9):
  - Place `8`s around these positions.

- The `3`s at positions (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5):
  - Place `8`s around these positions.

After applying the rule, the output grid will be:

41e4d17e,"To solve the problem, let's closely analyze the patterns in the provided training examples:

### Example 1:
- **Input:** A large block of 8s with a smaller block of 1s in the middle.
- **Output:** The 1s remain unchanged, but some 8s around the 1s are changed to 6s.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** Similar to Example 1, but with two separate blocks of 1s.
- **Output:** The 1s remain unchanged, but some 8s around the 1s are changed to 6s. The 6s form a pattern that surrounds the 1s.

### Observations:
1. The 1s in the input remain as 1s in the output.
2. The 8s that are adjacent to 1s (horizontally or vertically) are changed to 6s.
3. The 8s that are not adjacent to 1s remain as 8s.

48d8fb45,"To solve the test case, I need to understand the transformation rule based on the given training examples.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Example 1**:
   - The input has a small cluster of `1`s and a `5`.
   - The output is a 3x3 grid that captures the core of the `1` cluster.
   - The `5` is not included in the output.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input has a cluster of `4`s.
   - The output is a 3x3 grid that captures the core of the `4` cluster.
   - The `5` is not included in the output.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input has a cluster of `2`s.
   - The output is a 3x3 grid that captures the core of the `2` cluster.
   - The `5` is not included in the output.

### General Rule:
- The transformation extracts a 3x3 grid centered around the most significant cluster of non-zero values (excluding any isolated or less significant clusters).
- The ""most significant"" cluster is the one with the highest density of non-zero values or the one that forms a contiguous shape.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- The test case has a cluster of `3`s forming an ""L"" shape.
- The most significant cluster is the one with the highest density of `3`s, which is in the bottom-left part of the grid.

### Extracting the 3x3 Grid:
- Center the 3x3 grid around the densest part of the `3` cluster.
- The densest part is at the coordinates (6, 2) to (8, 4).

### Final Output:
``` 
[
[3, 0, 0],
[3, 3, 0],
[3, 3, 3]

**Observation:**
- In the input grids, we see blocks of the same color.
- In the output grids, these blocks are expanded diagonally downwards to fill the entire column with the color until reaching the bottom.

**Rule:**
- For any non-zero value in the input grid, that value is extended diagonally downwards to fill the entire column below it.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case:**

```

**Transformation:**
- The 8 at (3, 5) is extended downwards to fill the entire 6th column.
- The 8s at (4, 3) and (5, 3) are extended downwards to fill the entire 4th column.
- The 8 at (7, 2) is extended downwards to fill the entire 3rd column.
- The 8 at (7, 5) is already covered by the extension from (3, 5).

3. Expand `8` in the third row:
   - `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
4. The fourth, fifth, and sixth rows remain unchanged as they contain only `4` and `0`.

We need to check each cell containing a ""4"" to see if it has a neighboring ""3"" or ""2"". If so, we add ""1"" to that cell.

1. **Row 4, Column 3**: The ""4"" has a neighboring ""2"" at (4,5), so it should become ""4 + 1 = 5"".
2. **Row 4, Column 12**: The ""4"" has a neighboring ""4"" at (4,11) and a ""4"" at (5,12), but no ""3"" or ""2"" directly adjacent, so it remains ""4"".
3. **Row 4, Column 13**: The ""4"" has a neighboring ""3"" at (5,13), so it should become ""4 + 1 = 5"".
4. **Row 5, Column 5**: The ""4"" has a neighboring ""3"" at (5,6), so it should become ""4 + 1 = 5"".
5. **Row 5, Column 12**: The ""4"" has a neighboring ""2"" at (5,13), so it should become ""4 + 1 = 5"".
6. **Row 10, Column 2**: The ""4"" has a neighboring ""2"" at (10,9), so it should become ""4 + 1 = 5"".
7. **Row 10, Column 10**: The ""4"" has a neighboring ""2"" at (10,9), so it should become ""4 + 1 = 5"".
8. **Row 11, Column 3**: The ""4"" has a neighboring ""4"" at (11,2) and a ""4"" at (12,3), but no ""3"" or ""2"" directly adjacent, so it remains ""4"".
9. **Row 11, Column 11**: The ""4"" has a neighboring ""2"" at (12,10), so it should become ""4 + 1 = 5"".
10. **Row 12, Column 3**: The ""4"" has a neighboring ""2"" at (12,2), so it should become ""4 + 1 = 5"".
11. **Row 12, Column 9**: The ""4"" has a neighboring ""2"" at (12,10), so it should become ""4 + 1 = 5"".

68b16354,"The pattern from the provided examples suggests that the transformation rule is to **reverse the order of the rows** in the grid.

Let's verify this with the given examples:

- Example 1: The original grid has its rows reversed to produce the output.
- Example 2: Similarly, the rows are reversed to produce the output.
- Example 3: Again, the rows are reversed to produce the output.

Given this understanding, we can apply the same rule to the test case.

Test Case Input:
```
[
[2, 8, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1],

[3, 2, 8, 4, 1, 8, 4],
[1, 4, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]]

bb43febb,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids in the training examples.

### Analysis of Example 1:
- **Input:** The grid has a large block of `5`s in the middle.
- **Output:** The inner part of the block of `5`s is replaced with `2`s, forming a border of `5`s around the `2`s.

### Analysis of Example 2:
- **Input:** The grid has two separate blocks of `5`s.
- **Output:** Each block of `5`s has its inner part replaced with `2`s, leaving a border of `5`s around the `2`s.

### General Rule:
- For any block of `5`s, the inner cells (not on the border) are changed to `2`.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input:** The grid has two blocks of `5`s:
  - One in the top-left corner.
  - One in the bottom-right corner.

Let's transform the test case according to the rule:

1. **Top-left block:**
   - The inner cells (rows 1-2, columns 1-5) should be changed to `2`.

2. **Bottom-right block:**
   - The inner cells (rows 5-9, columns 4-9) should be changed to `2`.

### Observations:
1. **Non-zero elements move to the bottom-left corner:**
   - In Example 1, the non-zero elements `3, 3, 8, 7, 5` move to the bottom-left corner.
   - In Example 2, the non-zero elements `5, 5, 2, 1` move to the bottom-left corner.

2. **Zero elements fill the remaining positions:**
   - In both examples, the zero elements fill the top-right corner of the grid.

### Transformation Rule:
- The grid is transformed such that all non-zero elements are moved to the bottom-left corner in the order they appear in the original grid, and zeros fill the remaining positions.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
**Input:**
```

1. Extract non-zero elements in the order they appear: `6, 3, 5, 6, 8, 4`.
2. Place these non-zero elements in the bottom-left corner.
3. Fill the remaining positions with zeros.

**Output:**
```

### Observations:
1. **Pattern of 8s and 1s**: 
   - In all examples, the output grid consists only of the numbers 8 and 1.
   - The number 1 appears in positions where the input grid has a 1, and the number 8 appears in all other positions.

2. **Positioning of 1s**:
   - The position of the 1 in the output grid corresponds to the position of the 1 in the input grid.
   - The 1 in the output grid is surrounded by 8s in a checkerboard pattern.

3. **Checkerboard Pattern**:
   - The 8s and 1s alternate in a checkerboard pattern, with the 1 in the position where the input grid has a 1.

- The 1 in the input grid is at position (9, 0) (0-indexed).
- We need to place a 1 at this position in the output grid and fill the rest of the grid with 8s in a checkerboard pattern.

### Example 1:
- **Input**: A 10x10 grid with a single `6` at position (2, 2) and a single `7` at position (7, 7).
- **Output**: The grid is filled with `6`s in the top half and `7`s in the bottom half, except for the rows and columns where the `6` and `7` originally appeared. These rows and columns remain unchanged.

### Example 2:
- **Input**: A 10x10 grid with a single `1` at position (2, 6) and a single `4` at position (7, 5).
- **Output**: The grid is filled with `1`s in the top half and `4`s in the bottom half, except for the rows and columns where the `1` and `4` originally appeared. These rows and columns remain unchanged.

### General Rule:
- For each non-zero value in the input grid:
  - The entire row and column containing that value are left unchanged.
  - The rest of the grid is filled with that value, but only in the half of the grid (top or bottom) where the value appears.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input**: A 10x10 grid with a single `2` at position (2, 4) and a single `8` at position (7, 6).
- **Output**: 
  - The row and column containing the `2` (row 2, column 4) will remain unchanged.
  - The row and column containing the `8` (row 7, column 6) will remain unchanged.
  - The top half of the grid (rows 0 to 4) will be filled with `2`s, except for the row and column containing the `2`.
  - The bottom half of the grid (rows 5 to 9) will be filled with `8`s, except for the row and column containing the `8`.

Let's construct the output grid step by step:

1. Initialize a 10x10 grid filled with zeros.
2. Fill the top half (rows 0 to 4) with `2`s, except for row 2 and column 4.
3. Fill the bottom half (rows 5 to 9) with `8`s, except for row 7 and column 6.
4. Place the original `2` at (2, 4) and `8` at (7, 6).

### Example 1:
- **Input**:
  - A 13x13 grid with various colors.
- **Output**:
  - A 4x4 grid that appears to contain a subset of the colors from the input, specifically the non-zero colors.

### Example 2:
- **Input**:
  - Another 13x13 grid with different placements of colors.
- **Output**:
  - Again, a 4x4 grid containing a subset of the non-zero colors from the input.

### Common Observations:
1. **Grid Size**: The output is always a 4x4 grid.
2. **Content**: The output grid contains only the non-zero colors from the input grid.
3. **Placement**: The non-zero colors in the output seem to be placed in a specific order or pattern.

### Hypothesis:
The transformation rule seems to involve selecting the first 4 rows and columns of non-zero colors from the input grid and placing them in the output grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input**:
  - A 13x13 grid with the following non-zero colors:
    - Row 3: [6, 8, 8]
    - Row 4: [6, 6, 8]
    - Row 7: [1, 1]
    - Row 10: [3, 3]
    - Row 11: [3]

- **Step-by-Step Transformation**:
  - Identify the first 4 non-zero colors in the first 4 rows and columns.
  - Place these colors in the 4x4 output grid.

### Result:
- The first 4 non-zero colors in the first 4 rows and columns are:
  - [6, 8, 8, 6]
  - [6, 6, 8, 0]
  - [1, 1, 0, 0]
  - [3, 3, 0, 0]

ac0a08a4,"To determine the pattern based on the provided training examples, we can observe that:

1. **Scaling**: Each cell in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block of the same value in the output grid.
2. **Positioning**: The position of the 2x2 blocks in the output grid corresponds to the original positions of the cells in the input grid.

Let's apply this transformation rule to the test case:

### Test Case Input:
```
[
[1, 0, 0],
[0, 9, 6],
[8, 0, 0]]
```

### Step-by-Step Transformation:
1. **Expand each cell into a 2x2 block**:
   - Cell (0,0) with value `1` becomes:
     ```
     [1, 1]
     [1, 1]
     ```
   - Cell (0,1) with value `0` becomes:
     ```
     [0, 0]
     [0, 0]
     ```
   - Cell (0,2) with value `0` becomes:
     ```
     [0, 0]
     [0, 0]
     ```
   - Cell (1,0) with value `0` becomes:
     ```
     [0, 0]
     [0, 0]
     ```
   - Cell (1,1) with value `9` becomes:
     ```
     [9, 9]
     [9, 9]
     ```
   - Cell (1,2) with value `6` becomes:
     ```
     [6, 6]
     [6, 6]
     ```
   - Cell (2,0) with value `8` becomes:
     ```
     [8, 8]
     [8, 8]
     ```
   - Cell (2,1) with value `0` becomes:
     ```
     [0, 0]
     [0, 0]
     ```
   - Cell (2,2) with value `0` becomes:
     ```
     [0, 0]
     [0, 0]
     ```

2. **Combine these blocks into the final output grid**:
   - The first row of the input grid expands to:
     ```
     [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     ```
   - The second row of the input grid expands to:
     ```
     [0, 0, 9, 9, 6, 6]
     [0, 0, 9, 9, 6, 6]
     ```
   - The third row of the input grid expands to:
     ```
     [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     ```

### Final Output:

  - A 10x10 grid with a single `1` at positions (4, 1) and (4, 7).
- **Output:**
  - A 10x10 grid where the `1`s remain in the same positions.
  - A `3` is added around the `1`s, forming a cross shape with the `1`s at the center.

### Example 2 Analysis:

- **Output:**
  - A 10x10 grid where the `1`s remain in the same positions.
  - A `3` is added around the `1`s, forming a cross shape with the `1`s at the center.

### General Transformation Rule:
- For each `1` in the input grid:
  - Place a `3` in the cells immediately above, below, to the left, and to the right of the `1`, forming a cross centered on the `1`.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input:**
  - A 12x12 grid with a single `1` at positions (3, 1) and (3, 10).

d687bc17,"To solve the puzzle, I'll analyze the transformations that occur in the training examples:

1. **Pattern Identification**:
    - In all examples, the transformation involves changing certain cells based on their neighbors.
    - Specifically, it seems that cells with a value of `2` or `4` (or sometimes other numbers) are spreading to adjacent cells that have a value of `0`.

2. **Transformation Rule**:
    - If a cell has a value of `2` or `4` and an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right) has a value of `0`, the adjacent cell changes to match the value of the original cell.

3. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**:
    - We will iterate through the grid and apply the rule to each cell.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: A 13x12 grid with a central 5x5 area containing the numbers 2, 4.
   - Output: A 4x4 grid where the central 2x2 area contains the number 2, and the rest is filled with 4.
   - Transformation: The output is a smaller grid that captures the central non-zero region of the input, with the border cells filled with the highest value present in the input (which is 4).

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: An 11x12 grid with a central 3x3 area containing the numbers 1, 3.
   - Output: A 3x3 grid where the central 1x1 area contains the number 1, and the rest is filled with 3.
   - Transformation: Similar to Example 1, the output is a smaller grid that captures the central non-zero region of the input, with the border cells filled with the highest value present in the input (which is 3).

   - Output: A 5x5 grid where the central 3x3 area contains the number 4, and the rest is filled with 6.
   - Transformation: The output is a smaller grid that captures the central non-zero region of the input, with the border cells filled with the highest value present in the input (which is 6).

### General Rule:
- The output grid is a smaller grid that captures the central non-zero region of the input.
- The border cells of the output grid are filled with the highest value present in the input grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input**: A 14x13 grid with a central 7x7 area containing the numbers 3, 8.
- **Output**: We need to extract the central non-zero region and fill the border cells with the highest value present in the input (which is 8).

### Steps:
1. Identify the central non-zero region: 7x7 area with values 3 and 8.
2. Create a 5x5 output grid.
3. Fill the central 3x3 area with the value 3.
4. Fill the border cells with the value 8.

   - Analysis: Again, the output contains 3s where there is a 7 in the input that is not part of a continuous block of 7s.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [7, 0, 7, 0],
     [0, 0, 7, 7],
     [7, 0, 7, 7],
     [7, 7, 0, 0],
     [4, 4, 4, 4],
     [0, 0, 2, 2],
     [0, 0, 0, 0],
     [2, 0, 0, 2],
     [0, 2, 0, 2]]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [0, 3, 0, 0],
     [3, 3, 0, 0],
     [0, 3, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 3, 0]]
     ```
   - Analysis: The same pattern holds: 3s appear where 7s are isolated or on the boundary of a block.

From these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- **Transform 7s to 3s if they are not part of a continuous block of 7s.**

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case:**
- Input:
  ```
  [
  [7, 7, 7, 7],
  [0, 7, 7, 7],
  [7, 0, 0, 0],
  [7, 0, 7, 0],
  [4, 4, 4, 4],
  [0, 2, 2, 2],
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [2, 0, 2, 2],
  [0, 2, 0, 0]]
  ```

- Output:
  - The 7s in the first row are part of a continuous block, so they do not become 3s.
  - The 7 in the second row at position (1, 1) is part of a continuous block, so it does not become 3.
  - The 7 in the third row at position (2, 0) is isolated and becomes 3.
  - The 7 in the fourth row at positions (3, 0) and (3, 2) are part of a continuous block, so they do not become 3.

Thus, the output grid is:
```

1. **Example 1**:

     ```
   - Output:

     [7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 7]
     [7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 7]

   - Similar to Example 1, the input grid is repeated both horizontally and vertically to form a 2x2 block pattern.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input:
     ```

     ```
   - Again, the input grid is repeated both horizontally and vertically to form a 2x2 block pattern.

From these examples, it is clear that the transformation rule involves repeating the input grid both horizontally and vertically to create a larger grid that is twice the size in both dimensions.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the test case:

- Test Input:
  ```
  [1, 4, 1]
  [4, 9, 4]
  [9, 1, 9]

- Applying the transformation rule:
  - Repeat the input grid both horizontally and vertically to form a 2x2 block pattern.

444801d8,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the provided examples.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Color 2 Expansion**:
   - In Example 1, the color `2` expands to all neighboring cells around the original `2`, forming a larger block of `2`s.
   - This expansion happens in a way that the `2` color surrounds the original `1`-shaped region.

2. **Multiple Color Expansion**:
   - In Example 2, the same expansion pattern occurs, but with multiple regions. Each region with a different color (e.g., `2` and `3`) expands similarly to form larger blocks of the respective colors.

3. **General Rule**:
   - For any non-zero color `c` (other than `1`), if it appears inside a region of `1`s, it expands to fill the entire region of `1`s, replacing them with `c`.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:

Given the test case:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
]
```

### Step-by-Step Transformation:

1. **Top Region**:
   - The `4` in the top region will expand to fill the entire region of `1`s.
   - The result will be:
     ```
     [4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     ```

2. **Bottom Region**:
   - The `7` in the bottom region will expand to fill the entire region of `1`s.
   - The result will be:
     ```
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

3. **Row 4**: The pair (4, 7).
   - Insert a row with 3s below (4, 7).
   - Result: `[0, 0, 0, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` and insert `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` below it.

   - **Observation**: The grid has a central symmetry, and the output is `1`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - **Input**: A grid with a row of `2`s and `0`s.
   - **Output**: `[7]`
   - **Observation**: The grid does not have a central symmetry, and the output is `7`.

3. **Example 3**:

   - **Observation**: The grid has a central symmetry, and the output is `1`.

4. **Example 4**:

   - **Observation**: The grid does not have a central symmetry, and the output is `7`.

From these observations, we can infer the transformation rule:
- If the grid has a central symmetry (i.e., the pattern on one side mirrors the other side through the center), the output is `[1]`.
- If the grid does not have a central symmetry, the output is `[7]`.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

  - **Analysis**:
    - The grid has a central symmetry. The top-left and bottom-right corners are the same, and the top-right and bottom-left corners are the same. The middle row is symmetric around the center.

ff28f65a,"To deduce the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Observation**: All the output grids are 3x3.
2. **Pattern**: In the output grids, `1` represents the presence of a 2x2 block of `2`s in the input grid, and `0` means there is no such block.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input has one 2x2 block of `2`s in the top-left corner.
  - Output: `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`

- **Example 2**:
  - Input has two 2x2 blocks of `2`s: one in the top-middle and one in the bottom-right.
  - Output: `[[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`

- **Example 3**:
  - Input has three 2x2 blocks of `2`s: one in the top-middle, one in the middle-right, and one in the bottom-left.
  - Output: `[[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`

- **Example 4**:
  - Input has two 2x2 blocks of `2`s: one in the top-middle and one in the bottom-left.
  - Output: `[[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`

- **Example 5**:
  - Input has one 2x2 block of `2`s in the bottom-left.
  - Output: `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`

- **Example 6**:
  - Input has three 2x2 blocks of `2`s: one in the top-middle, one in the middle-right, and one in the bottom-left.
  - Output: `[[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]`

- **Example 7**:
  - Input has three 2x2 blocks of `2`s: one in the top-middle, one in the middle-right, and one in the bottom-left.
  - Output: `[[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]`

- **Example 8**:
  - Input has three 2x2 blocks of `2`s: one in the top-middle, one in the middle-right, and one in the bottom-left.
  - Output: `[[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]`

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input**:
  ```

  [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```

- **Analysis**:
  - Top-left: No 2x2 block of `2`s.
  - Top-middle: One 2x2 block of `2`s.
  - Top-right: No 2x2 block of `2`s.
  - Middle-left: One 2x2 block of `2`s.
  - Middle-middle: No 2x2 block of `2`s.
  - Middle-right: One 2x2 block of `2`s.
  - Bottom-left: No 2x2 block of `2`s.
  - Bottom-middle: One 2x2 block of `2`s.
  - Bottom-right: No 2x2 block of `2`s.

c0f76784,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the given examples.

### Observations:
1. **Color Change Inside the Shape**:
   - In the examples, certain cells inside the shapes formed by the number `5` are changed to other numbers.
   - Specifically, cells that are surrounded by `5`s (forming a smaller shape within the larger shape) are changed to different numbers.

2. **Pattern of Changes**:
   - In Example 1, the cells in the middle of the shape are changed to `8`, and the center cell is changed to `6`.
   - In Example 2, similar changes are observed, with the inner cells changing to `7` and `8`.
   - In Example 3, the inner cells change to `8` and `7`.

### General Rule:
- **Inner Cells**: Cells that are completely surrounded by `5`s (i.e., all four adjacent cells are `5`s) are changed to `8`.
- **Central Cell**: If there is a single cell that is surrounded by `5`s and is the only cell not touching the boundary of the shape, it is changed to `6`.
- **Corner Cells**: If there are cells that are surrounded by `5`s but are not central, they are changed to `7`.

a1570a43,"To determine the transformation rule, I'll analyze the provided examples:

- **Observation 1:** The number 3 appears in the corners of the input and output grids, suggesting that these numbers remain unchanged.
- **Observation 2:** The number 2 appears to move or reorganize within the grid, often forming a more compact shape.
- **Observation 3:** The movement of 2s seems to create a pattern where they form a more symmetric or centered structure.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- **Rule 1:** Numbers 3 remain in their original positions.
- **Rule 2:** Numbers 2 move to form a more compact, centered, or symmetric shape within the grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case Analysis:**
- The number 3 is present in the corners, so they remain unchanged.
- The number 2 forms a vertical line in the middle of the grid. We need to reorganize them to form a more compact and centered shape.

### Pattern Analysis:
- In both examples, there is a distinct pattern where a specific digit (like 7 in Example 1 and 8 in Example 2) forms a ""cross"" or ""plus"" shape.
- The transformation rule seems to be:
  - For each occurrence of the central digit (e.g., 7 or 8), the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) are filled with the other digit (e.g., 2 in Example 1 and 6 in Example 2).

### Applying the Transformation Rule to the Test Case:
- In the test case, the central digits are 3 and 4.
- The pattern suggests that 3 should form the cross, and 4 should fill the adjacent cells.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be extracting a subgrid from the top-left corner of the input grid, where the size of the subgrid is determined by the smallest dimension (either width or height) of the input grid.

a85d4709,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the training examples:

1. **Color Mapping**:
   - In Example 1, the color 5 is mapped to 2, 3, or 4 depending on its position.
   - In Example 2, the color 5 is consistently mapped to 3.
   - In Example 3, the color 5 is mapped to 2 or 4 depending on its position.
   - In Example 4, the color 5 is mapped to 4 or 3 depending on its position.

2. **Position Dependency**:
   - In Example 1, the top-left 5 is mapped to 2, the middle 5 is mapped to 4, and the bottom-left 5 is mapped to 2.
   - In Example 3, the top-left 5 is mapped to 2, the middle 5 is mapped to 4, and the bottom-left 5 is mapped to 2.
   - In Example 4, the top-middle 5 is mapped to 4, the middle-right 5 is mapped to 3, and the bottom-middle 5 is mapped to 4.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule depends on both the color and the position of the cell in the grid. Specifically, the color 5 is mapped to different values based on its row and column position.

Let's break down the pattern:
- **Top row**: 5 is mapped to 2.
- **Middle row**: 5 is mapped to 4.
- **Bottom row**: 5 is mapped to 2.
- **Left column**: 5 is mapped to 2.
- **Middle column**: 5 is mapped to 4.
- **Right column**: 5 is mapped to 3.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case:
```
[
[0, 0, 5],
[5, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 0]
]
```

- The top-right 5 is in the right column, so it should be mapped to 3.
- The middle-left 5 is in the left column, so it should be mapped to 2.
- The bottom-middle 5 is in the middle column, so it should be mapped to 4.

Applying the rule, the output should be:
```
[
[3, 3, 3],
[2, 2, 2],
[4, 4, 4]
]
```

However, this does not match the specific positions in the test case. Let's refine the rule:

- Top-right 5 (row 1, column 3) -> 3
- Middle-left 5 (row 2, column 1) -> 2
- Bottom-middle 5 (row 3, column 2) -> 4

So the correct output should be:
```
[
[3, 3, 3],
[2, 2, 2],
[4, 4, 4]

```

But to match the specific positions:
```

1b60fb0c,"To understand the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

### Example Analysis

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** 
  - The grid has a shape with 1s forming a pattern.
- **Output:**
  - The output grid is similar to the input, but some 0s have been replaced with 2s. Specifically, the 0s that are adjacent to the 1s and form a connected region around the 1s are replaced with 2s.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:**
  - Similar to Example 1, but with a different pattern of 1s.
- **Output:**
  - The 0s that are adjacent to the 1s and form a connected region around the 1s are replaced with 2s.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:**
  - Another pattern of 1s.
- **Output:**
  - The 0s that are adjacent to the 1s and form a connected region around the 1s are replaced with 2s.

### Transformation Rule
The transformation rule appears to be:
- Replace all 0s that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any 1 in the grid with 2s.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case
Let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case:**
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```

- **Output:**
  - We need to replace all 0s that are adjacent to any 1 with 2s.

Let's perform the transformation step by step:

1. Identify all 1s in the grid.
2. For each 1, check its neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
3. If a neighbor is 0, replace it with 2.

After performing these steps, the output grid should look like this:

63613498,"To determine the transformation rule, I'll analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples.

### Example 1 Analysis:
- **Input** has a 6x2 rectangle of `6` at the bottom, which is replaced with `5` in the **Output**.
- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input** has a 2x2 rectangle of `9` in the bottom-right corner, which is replaced with `5` in the **Output**.
- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- **Input** has a 2x3 rectangle of `1` on the right side, which is replaced with `5` in the **Output**.
- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

### General Rule:
- The transformation rule appears to be replacing all instances of a specific color (other than `0`) with `5`. The color to be replaced is the one that forms a contiguous block (rectangle) in the grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- In the **Test** grid, there are several blocks of different colors:
  - A 2x3 block of `2` in the top-left corner.
  - A 3x2 block of `3` in the middle-right.
  - A 3x1 block of `4` on the right side.
  - A 3x3 block of `7` in the bottom-middle.
  - A 3x1 block of `8` on the left side.
- The largest contiguous block of a single color is the 2x3 block of `2` in the top-left corner.
- Therefore, we replace all `2`s in the grid with `5`.

### Analysis:
1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Two distinct blocks of `4`s.
   - **Output:** In the first block, a smaller block of `1`s is placed in the middle. In the second block, a smaller block of `2`s is placed in the middle.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Two distinct blocks of `4`s.
   - **Output:** In the first block, a smaller block of `2`s is placed in the middle. In the second block, a smaller block of `1`s is placed in the middle.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:
- If there is a block of `4`s, a smaller block of a different color (`1` or `2`) is placed inside it, centered within the larger block.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- The test case has two distinct blocks of `4`s:
  - One large block at the top.
  - One large block at the bottom.

- We need to place a smaller block of a different color inside each of these blocks.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Top Block:**
   - The top block is a 6x6 block of `4`s.
   - Place a 4x4 block of `2`s in the center of this block.

2. **Bottom Block:**
   - The bottom block is a 3x6 block of `4`s.
   - Place a 2x2 block of `1`s in the center of this block.

dae9d2b5,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids. Let's analyze the provided examples:

### Example Analysis:
1. **Input:** 
   ```
   [4, 4, 0, 3, 3, 0],
   [4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   [6, 6, 0],
   [6, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 6]
   ```

2. **Input:**
   ```
   [4, 0, 4, 3, 3, 0],
   [4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0]
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   [6, 6, 6],
   [6, 0, 0],
   [6, 0, 6]
   ```

3. **Input:**
   ```
   [0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0],
   [0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 3],
   [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3]
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   [0, 6, 6],
   [6, 6, 6],
   [6, 6, 6]
   ```

4. **Input:**
   ```
   [4, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
   [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   [6, 6, 0],
   [0, 0, 6],
   [6, 0, 0]
   ```

5. **Input:**
   ```
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
   [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 0]
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   [0, 6, 0],
   [6, 0, 0],
   [6, 6, 6]
   ```

### Observations:
- The output grid is always a 3x3 grid.
- The positions of zeros in the output grid correspond to the positions of zeros in the input grid.
- The non-zero values in the output grid are all 6.
- The positions of 6s in the output grid correspond to the positions of 4s and 3s in the input grid.

### Transformation Rule:
- For each 3x3 subgrid in the input, if any of the cells contain a 4 or a 3, the corresponding cell in the output grid is set to 6. If the cell is 0, it remains 0.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
**Input:**
```
[0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0],
[4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0],
[0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0]
```

- The first 3x3 subgrid:
  ```
  [0, 4, 4],
  [4, 0, 0],
  [0, 4, 0]
  ```
  - All non-zero cells contain 4, so the output is:
  ```
  [6, 6, 6],
  [6, 0, 0],
  [6, 6, 0]
  ```

- The second 3x3 subgrid:
  ```
  [3, 0, 0],
  [3, 3, 0],
  [3, 0, 0]
  ```
  - All non-zero cells contain 3, so the output is:
  ```
  [6, 0, 0],
  [6, 6, 0],
  [6, 0, 0]
  ```

Combining these subgrids, the final output is:
```
[6, 6, 6],
[6, 0, 0],

d2abd087,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the example transformations:

### Analysis of Example 1:
- **Input:** The input contains areas of `5`s.
- **Output:** The output replaces these areas of `5`s with `2`s, and single `5`s with `1`s.

### Analysis of Example 2:
- **Input:** Similar to Example 1, but with more complex shapes.
- **Output:** The same rule applies: areas of `5`s are replaced with `2`s, and single `5`s are replaced with `1`s.

### Analysis of Example 3:
- **Input:** More complex shapes and arrangements of `5`s.
- **Output:** Again, the same rule: areas of `5`s are replaced with `2`s, and single `5`s are replaced with `1`s.

### General Rule:
- **Single `5`:** Replaced with `1`.
- **Area of `5`s (connected horizontally or vertically):** Replaced with `2`.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
Let's apply this rule to the test case:

#### Test Case Input:
```
[
[0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

#### Transformation:
- Identify areas of `5`s and replace them with `2`s.
- Identify single `5`s and replace them with `1`s.

#### Step-by-Step Transformation:
1. Replace the area of `5`s in the top-left corner:
   ```
   [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
   [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
   ```
2. Replace the area of `5`s in the third row:
   ```
   [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
   ```
3. Replace the area of `5`s in the fifth row:
   ```
   [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
   ```
4. Replace the area of `5`s in the sixth row:
   ```
   [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
   ```
5. Replace the area of `5`s in the eighth row:
   ```
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
   ```
6. Replace the area of `5`s in the ninth row:
   ```
   [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ```

d406998b,"To determine the transformation rule based on the provided examples, let's analyze the changes:

1. **Observation of the Pattern**:
   - In all the examples, the number 5 is replaced with 3 if it is surrounded by at least two 0s in its immediate neighborhood (up, down, left, right).

2. **Transformation Rule**:
   - If a cell contains a 5 and has at least two 0s among its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right), it is changed to 3.
   - All other cells remain unchanged.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

### Test Case Analysis:

[0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5]]
```

### Applying the Transformation Rule:
- **First Row**:
  - 5 at position (0, 3) has two 0s as neighbors (left and right), so it becomes 3.
  - 5 at position (0, 7) has two 0s as neighbors (left and right), so it becomes 3.
  - 5 at position (0, 9) has one 0 as a neighbor (right), so it remains 5.
  - 5 at position (0, 12) has one 0 as a neighbor (right), so it remains 5.
  - 5 at position (0, 14) has one 0 as a neighbor (left), so it remains 5.
  - 5 at position (0, 16) has one 0 as a neighbor (left), so it remains 5.

- **Second Row**:
  - 5 at position (1, 0) has one 0 as a neighbor (right), so it remains 5.
  - 5 at position (1, 2) has one 0 as a neighbor (right), so it remains 5.
  - 5 at position (1, 5) has two 0s as neighbors (left and right), so it becomes 3.
  - 5 at position (1, 8) has one 0 as a neighbor (right), so it remains 5.
  - 5 at position (1, 11) has two 0s as neighbors (left and right), so it becomes 3.
  - 5 at position (1, 15) has one 0 as a neighbor (left), so it remains 5.

- **Third Row**:
  - 5 at position (2, 1) has one 0 as a neighbor (right), so it remains 5.
  - 5 at position (2, 4) has one 0 as a neighbor (right), so it remains 5.
  - 5 at position (2, 6) has one 0 as a neighbor (right), so it remains 5.
  - 5 at position (2, 10) has two 0s as neighbors (left and right), so it becomes 3.
  - 5 at position (2, 13) has one 0 as a neighbor (right), so it remains 5.
  - 5 at position (2, 16) has one 0 as a neighbor (left), so it remains 5.

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - In the output grids, the first few columns seem to repeat the initial pattern of the non-zero values from the input.
   - When there is a 1 in the input grid, it seems to trigger a repetition of the initial pattern starting from the column with the 1.

2. **Transformation Rule**:
   - For each row, if there is a 1 in the input grid, the pattern of the initial non-zero values is repeated starting from the column with the 1.
   - If there is no 1 in the row, the pattern of the initial non-zero values is repeated starting from the first zero column.

   - Output: `[8, 9, 8, 5, 8, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

4. **Row 4**: No 1s, so repeat the initial pattern starting from the first zero column.
   - Initial pattern: `[5]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

5. **Row 5**: 1 at column 6, so repeat the initial pattern starting from column 6.
   - Initial pattern: `[5]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]`

6. **Row 6**: No 1s, so repeat the initial pattern starting from the first zero column.
   - Initial pattern: `[5]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

   - Initial pattern: `[5]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

93b581b8,"To solve the test case, let's analyze the transformation pattern from the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: The numbers `9`, `3`, `7`, and `8` are in the middle of the grid.
   - Output: These numbers remain in the same position, but two new rows are added above and below them, containing mirrored pairs of the numbers on the sides.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: The numbers `4`, `6`, `2`, and `1` are in the top-left part of the grid.
   - Output: These numbers remain in the same position, but two new rows are added at the bottom, containing mirrored pairs of the numbers on the sides.

3. **Example 3:**

   - Output: These numbers remain in the same position, but two new rows are added at the top and bottom, containing mirrored pairs of the numbers on the sides.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is:
- The existing non-zero numbers remain in their original positions.
- Two new rows are added at the top and bottom of the grid.
- These new rows contain mirrored pairs of the numbers on the sides of the grid, repeated twice.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- Output:
  - The numbers `3`, `1`, `2`, and `5` remain in their original positions.
  - Two new rows are added at the top and bottom, containing mirrored pairs of the numbers on the sides.

150deff5,"To solve this, let's observe the patterns in the transformations:

- **Pattern 1:** All `5` cells that are not on the edge of a contiguous group of `5`s (i.e., they are surrounded by other `5`s) are changed to `2`.
- **Pattern 2:** All `5` cells that are on the edge of a contiguous group of `5`s (i.e., they are adjacent to a `0`) are changed to `8`.

Let's apply these rules to the test case:

### Test Case
Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

### Transformation
1. **Identify the edges and interiors:**
   - The `5` cells that are on the edges will be changed to `8`.
   - The `5` cells that are not on the edges (surrounded by other `5`s) will be changed to `2`.

2. **Apply the transformation:**
   - Top-left block:
     ```
     [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0]
     [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     ```
   - Middle block:
     ```
     [0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     ```
   - Bottom blocks:
     ```

3e980e27,"To solve the test case, let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided examples:

### Analysis of Examples

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** A shape with `2` and `1` forming a small cluster.
   - **Output:** The same shape is shifted down and to the right.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** A shape with `3` and `4` forming a larger cluster.
   - **Output:** The same shape is shifted down and to the left.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** A more complex shape with `3`, `8`, and `2`.
   - **Output:** The same shape is shifted down and to the right.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** A shape with `1`, `3`, `4`, and `8`.
   - **Output:** The same shape is shifted down and to the left.

### General Rule
The transformation rule appears to be a combination of shifting the non-zero elements in the grid. Specifically, the non-zero elements are shifted in such a way that they form a consistent pattern, often moving down and to the left or right depending on the initial configuration.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case

Given the test case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```

### Transformation
- The top-left cluster (`1`, `2`, `1`) should shift down and to the right.
- The middle cluster (`8`, `3`, `8`) should shift down and to the left.
- The bottom cluster (`2`, `3`) should shift down and to the left.

### Resulting Output

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

### Example 1 Analysis:
- **Input:** A 6x6 grid where the boundary is filled with 3s, and inside there is a smaller square of 2s with 0s in the center.
- **Output:** A 6x6 grid where the boundary is filled with 0s, and inside there is a smaller square of 3s with 2s in the center.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input:** A 6x6 grid where the boundary is filled with 0s, and inside there is a smaller square of 7s with 6s in the center.
- **Output:** A 6x6 grid where the boundary is filled with 6s, and inside there is a smaller square of 0s with 7s in the center.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- **Input:** An 8x8 grid where the boundary is filled with 8s, and inside there is a smaller square of 5s with 8s in the center.
- **Output:** An 8x8 grid where the boundary is filled with 5s, and inside there is a smaller square of 8s with 0s in the center and 5s in the innermost part.

### General Rule:
- **Boundary Swap:** The boundary color (outermost layer) of the input grid becomes the innermost layer of the output grid.
- **Inner Swap:** The innermost layer of the input grid becomes the boundary of the output grid.
- **Center Swap:** The color that was originally at the center of the innermost layer in the input grid remains in the center but surrounded by the boundary color.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input:** A 6x6 grid where the boundary is filled with 9s, and inside there is a smaller square of 0s with 1s in the center.
- **Output:** A 6x6 grid where the boundary is filled with 1s, and inside there is a smaller square of 9s with 0s in the center.

Let's construct the output grid step by step:
1. **Boundary Swap:** The outermost 9s become the innermost layer.
2. **Inner Swap:** The innermost 0s become the boundary.
3. **Center Swap:** The 1s remain in the center but surrounded by the boundary color.

The resulting output grid is:

### Example 1 Analysis
- **Input:** The input contains a few non-zero cells with values `2` and `5`.
- **Output:** The output shows that all `5`s have moved to the leftmost possible position in their respective rows where they do not overlap with any `2`s.

### Example 2 Analysis
- **Input:** The input again has `2`s and `5`s.
- **Output:** Similarly, all `5`s have moved to the leftmost possible position in their respective rows where they do not overlap with any `2`s.

### General Rule
- The `5`s in the input grid move to the leftmost possible position in their row without overlapping with any `2`s. If there are no `2`s in the row, the `5` moves to the first column.

### Transforming the Test Case
1. **Row 1:** Move `5` to the first column.
   - Result: `[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
2. **Row 2:** Move `5` to the first column.
   - Result: `[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
3. **Row 7:** Move `5` to the right of the `2`s.
   - Result: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]`
4. **Row 10:** Move `5` to the first column.
   - Result: `[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

All other rows remain unchanged as they do not contain any `5`s.

ea32f347,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Color Mapping**:
    - Color `5` in the input is transformed into different colors in the output.
    - Specifically, `5` is replaced with:
        - `1` if it is the first occurrence in a column.
        - `4` if it is not the first occurrence but is part of a vertical line of `5`s.
        - `2` if it is not the first occurrence but is part of a horizontal line of `5`s.

2. **Vertical Line**:
    - If a column has multiple `5`s, they are all changed to `4` except the first one which becomes `1`.

3. **Horizontal Line**:
    - If a row has multiple `5`s, they are all changed to `2` except the first one which becomes `1`.

4. **Single Occurrence**:
    - If a `5` is the only one in its row and column, it is changed to `1`.

- **Column 4** has multiple `5`s, so they will be changed to `4` except the first one which becomes `1`.
- **Row 6** has multiple `5`s, so they will be changed to `2` except the first one which becomes `1`.
- **Row 9** has multiple `5`s, so they will be changed to `2` except the first one which becomes `1`.

e98196ab,"To understand the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input grid has rows with many zeros and a row of 5s.
   - Output grid is a smaller version of the input grid, where the row of 5s is removed, and the remaining rows are compressed together.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Similar to Example 1, the input grid has a row of 5s in the middle.
   - The output grid is again a smaller version of the input grid, with the row of 5s removed and the remaining rows compressed.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input grid has a row of 5s in the middle.
   - The output grid is a smaller version of the input grid, with the row of 5s removed and the remaining rows compressed.

- Remove the row filled with 5s.
- Compress the remaining rows together.

e3497940,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples step by step:

### Example 1:
- **Input:** A 10x9 grid with a central column containing the number 5.
- **Output:** A 10x4 grid where the non-zero values appear only in the columns adjacent to the central column.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** A 10x9 grid with a central column containing the number 5 and other numbers around it.
- **Output:** A 10x4 grid where the non-zero values appear only in the columns adjacent to the central column.

### Example 3:
- **Input:** A 10x9 grid with a central column containing the number 5 and other numbers around it.
- **Output:** A 10x4 grid where the non-zero values appear only in the columns adjacent to the central column.

### Common Pattern:
- The output grid is always 10x4.
- The non-zero values in the output grid are taken from the columns immediately adjacent to the central column (columns 4 and 5) of the input grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input:** A 10x9 grid with a central column containing the number 5 and other numbers around it.
- **Transformation:** Extract the values from columns 4 and 5 of the input grid and place them in the output grid.

Let's extract the values from columns 4 and 5 of the test case input:

```python

    output_grid.append(output_row)

### Observations:
1. **Color 3 Transformation:** The color 3 in the input seems to be transformed into color 2 in the output, but only in certain positions.
2. **Pattern Recognition:** The positions where color 3 is transformed to color 2 seem to follow a pattern related to the presence of color 1 in the input grid.

### Hypothesis:
- **Transformation Rule:** Color 3 is transformed to color 2 if it is adjacent to (horizontally or vertically) a color 1 in the input grid. Otherwise, it remains 0 in the output.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
**Test Case Input:**
```
[
[0, 3, 0, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 0],

[0, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 0, 0]
]
```

**Step-by-Step Transformation:**
1. Check each cell with color 3 and see if it is adjacent to a cell with color 1.
2. If a cell with color 3 is adjacent to a cell with color 1, transform it to color 2.
3. Otherwise, keep it as 0.

e48d4e1a,"To solve this puzzle, we need to observe the pattern in the transformation from the input to the output grids.

### Observations:
1. **Color Shift**: In each example, the color that appears in a solid row (all cells in that row have the same color) shifts position.
2. **Shift Direction**: The color in the solid row shifts to the leftmost column, and all other cells in that column become 0.
3. **Row Identification**: The row with the solid color is identified, and the color in that row is moved to the leftmost column.
4. **Remaining Rows**: All other rows remain mostly unchanged, except that the color that was in the solid row is now shifted to the leftmost column.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
Given the test case:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

```

1. Identify the solid row: The 4th row is solid with the color 8.
2. Shift the color 8 to the leftmost column in all rows.
3. Set all other cells in the leftmost column to 0.

Applying these steps:

- The 4th row becomes: `[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- All other rows shift the 8 to the first column and set the rest of the first column to 0.

56dc2b01,"Let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

1. **Observing the Placement of ""8""**:
   - In all examples, the number `8` appears in a line or block that connects the regions with `3`s and `2`s.
   - The `8`s form a bridge between the two regions, replacing the `0`s in the path.

2. **Direction of the Bridge**:
   - The direction of the bridge (where `8`s appear) is vertical if the `2`s and `3`s are in different rows.
   - If the `2`s and `3`s are in the same row, the `8`s appear horizontally between them.

3. **Behavior in Different Configurations**:
   - Example 1: The `8`s form a vertical line connecting the `3`s above and the `2`s below.
   - Example 2: The `8`s form a horizontal line connecting the `3`s on the bottom and the `2`s on the top.
   - Example 3: The `8`s form a horizontal line connecting the `3`s on the bottom and the `2`s on the top.

4. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**:
   - In the test case, the `2`s are in the first four columns of the first four rows.
   - The `3`s are in the last four columns of the first three rows.
   - Since the `2`s and `3`s are in the same row, the `8`s should form a horizontal line between them.

97999447,"To determine the transformation rule based on the provided examples:

1. **Observation**:
   - When there is a non-zero value in the input grid, the corresponding row in the output grid changes.
   - Specifically, after the first non-zero value in a row, alternating `5`s and the original non-zero value are added to the right of the initial non-zero value.

2. **Transformation Rule**:
   - For each row in the grid, if a non-zero value appears, starting from that value, alternate between the non-zero value and `5` until the end of the row.

3. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**:
   - Row 2: First non-zero value is `3`. The row becomes `[0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 3, 5, 3]`.
   - Row 3: First non-zero value is `4`. The row becomes `[0, 0, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5]`.
   - Row 5: First non-zero value is `8`. The row becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 8, 5]`.
   - Row 7: First non-zero value is `2`. The row becomes `[0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2]`.

4. **Resulting Grid**:
   - Apply the rule to the entire grid to get the final output.

aedd82e4,"To solve the transformation, let's analyze the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: The only change is the `2` in the bottom-left corner being replaced by a `1`.
- **Example 2**: The `2` in the bottom-right corner is replaced by a `1`, and another `2` above it is also replaced by a `1`.
- **Example 3**: The `2` in the third row, fourth column is replaced by a `1`.
- **Example 4**: The `2`s in the second row, third column and the first row, third column are replaced by `1`s.

From these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule is to replace each `2` with a `1` if it is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a `0`.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```
[
[2, 2, 0, 2],
[0, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0],
[2, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 2]
]
```

- The `2` at position (1, 3) is adjacent to a `0` at (1, 2), so it should be replaced by `1`.
- The `2` at position (2, 2) is adjacent to a `0` at (2, 1) and (2, 3), so it should be replaced by `1`.
- The `2` at position (3, 3) is adjacent to a `0` at (3, 2) and (3, 4), so it should be replaced by `1`.
- The `2` at position (4, 1) is adjacent to a `0` at (4, 2), so it should be replaced by `1`.
- The `2` at position (5, 3) is adjacent to a `0` at (5, 2) and (5, 4), so it should be replaced by `1`.
- The `2` at position (5, 4) is adjacent to a `0` at (5, 3), so it should be replaced by `1`.

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** A 10x10 grid with a small cluster of 3s in the middle and a small cluster of 7s at the bottom-right.
   - **Output:** A 3x3 grid containing only the values from the clusters (3s and 7s).

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** A 10x10 grid with a cluster of 6s in the middle and a cluster of 4s in the top-right.
   - **Output:** A 3x3 grid containing only the values from the clusters (6s and 4s).

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** A 10x10 grid with a cluster of 3s in the middle and a cluster of 1s at the bottom-left.
   - **Output:** A 3x3 grid containing only the values from the clusters (3s and 1s).

From these examples, we can infer that the transformation rule involves extracting a 3x3 grid that contains the non-zero values from the input grid. Specifically, the 3x3 grid seems to be centered around the largest cluster of non-zero values.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case:**
- **Input:**

- **Output:**
  - We need to extract a 3x3 grid centered around the largest cluster of non-zero values. In this case, there are two clusters: one of 2s and one of 8s.
  - The cluster of 8s is larger and more centralized, so we will focus on it.

The 3x3 grid centered around the cluster of 8s is:

28bf18c6,"To tackle this problem, I'll analyze the transformations in the examples provided:

1. **Cropping**: All output grids have a smaller size than their respective input grids. This suggests that the transformation involves cropping the original grid.
2. **Color Preservation**: The non-zero colors in the output grids match the non-zero colors present in the corresponding input grids. This indicates that the transformation preserves the colors but may change their positions or arrangement.
3. **Pattern Recognition**: The output grids seem to capture the ""shape"" or ""pattern"" of the non-zero elements in the input grids, possibly by focusing on a specific region or by rearranging the elements.

Let's break down the transformation process based on the examples:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: A grid with a pattern of 8s.
  - Output: A cropped version of the input, focusing on the 8s and maintaining their relative positions.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: A grid with a pattern of 2s.
  - Output: A cropped version of the input, focusing on the 2s and maintaining their relative positions.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: A grid with a pattern of 1s.
  - Output: A cropped version of the input, focusing on the 1s and maintaining their relative positions.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- **Crop the input grid to include only the region containing the non-zero elements**.
- **Maintain the relative positions of the non-zero elements within this cropped region**.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case**:
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

1. **Identify the region containing non-zero elements**:
   - The non-zero elements are 3s, located in rows 5 to 7 and columns 1 to 4.

2. **Crop the grid to this region**:
   - The cropped region will be:
     [
     [0, 3, 3, 3],
     [3, 0, 0, 0]
     ]

3. **Maintain the relative positions of the non-zero elements**:
   - The cropped region already maintains the relative positions of the non-zero elements.

Thus, the final output for the test case is:

- In Example 3, the original 3x3 grid is extended by repeating the last two rows at the bottom and the first two rows at the top.
- In Example 4, the original 3x3 grid is extended by repeating the last two rows at the bottom and the first two rows at the top.

From these observations, it appears that the transformation rule is to repeat the last two rows of the input grid at the bottom and the first two rows at the top of the output grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
[
[2, 9, 2],
[8, 5, 2],

Transformation:
- First two rows (repeated at the top): [2, 9, 2], [8, 5, 2]

2. **Example 2**:
   - The pattern of 3s and 6s forms a block.
   - In the output, the 3s and 6s are expanded to form a larger block with additional 3s and 6s around the original positions.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The pattern of 8s and 9s forms a vertical bar.
   - In the output, the 8s and 9s are expanded to form a larger vertical bar with additional 8s and 9s around the original positions.

### Observations:
1. **Color 2 Propagation**:
   - In all examples, color 2 seems to propagate to adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically) if those cells are not already color 2.
   - For example, in Example 1, the cell at (1, 7) is 2, and it causes the cells at (1, 8) and (2, 7) to become 2.
   - Similarly, in Example 2, the block of 2s in the middle causes surrounding cells to also become 2.

2. **No Change for Other Colors**:
   - Cells that are not 2 do not change unless they are adjacent to a 2.
   - For example, in Example 1, cells that are 0 or 5 remain unchanged unless influenced by a 2.

### Transformation Rule:
- **If a cell is 2, it will cause all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to become 2, provided they are not already 2.**

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
Let's apply this rule step by step to the test case:

[5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
]
```

#### Step-by-Step Propagation:
1. **(5, 5) and (5, 6)** are 2:
   - Adjacent cells: (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 7), (6, 5), (6, 6).

2. **(6, 5) and (6, 6)** are 2:
   - Adjacent cells: (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 5), (7, 6).

3. **(6, 5) and (6, 6)** will cause further propagation:
   - (7, 5) and (7, 6) will cause (7, 4), (7, 7) to become 2.

4. **(5, 5) and (5, 6)** will cause further propagation:
   - (4, 5) and (4, 6) will cause (4, 4), (4, 7) to become 2.

5. **Continue until no more changes occur**.

963e52fc,"Let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided training examples:

1. **Input vs. Output Dimensions**: In all examples, the output grid is exactly double in width compared to the input grid while maintaining the same height. This suggests that each row in the input is being duplicated horizontally.

2. **Pattern Replication**: Upon closer inspection, each element in the input row is repeated twice consecutively in the corresponding row of the output. For instance, if an input row is `[2, 8, 2]`, the corresponding output row becomes `[2, 8, 2, 2, 8, 2]`.

Given this understanding, let's apply the same transformation to the test case:

**Test Case Input:**
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1],
[3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

**Applying the Transformation:**

- Each element in a row is repeated twice.
- The first row `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- The second row `[3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1]` becomes `[3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1]`.
- The third row `[3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1]` becomes `[3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1]`.
- The fourth row `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- The fifth row `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

Thus, the transformed test case output is:

### Analysis of Transformation Rule:
1. **Example 1:** The input has many different numbers, but the output is a uniform grid where each row is identical and consists of the first row of the input.
2. **Example 2:** Similar to Example 1, the output is a uniform grid where each row is identical and consists of the first row of the input.
3. **Example 3:** Again, the output is a uniform grid where each row is identical and consists of the first row of the input.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- **Take the first row of the input grid and repeat it for all rows in the output grid.**

6a1e5592,"To solve the puzzle and transform the input grid into the output grid, let's analyze the provided training examples to deduce the transformation rule.

### Observation and Analysis

1. **Pattern of Change**:
   - In both examples, the number `0` in the input is often replaced with the number `1` in the output.
   - The transformation only affects certain areas of the grid, specifically where there are `0`s surrounded by non-zero values.

2. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The boundary of the grid remains unchanged if it consists of `2`s.
   - The `0`s that are not surrounded by non-zero values remain `0`.

3. **Transformation Rule**:
   - A `0` is changed to `1` if it is adjacent to at least one non-zero value (horizontally or vertically).
   - If a `0` is not adjacent to any non-zero value, it remains `0`.

### Applying the Transformation Rule to the Test Case

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:

#### Test Case Input

```

#### Step-by-Step Transformation

1. **First Row**:
   - All `2`s remain `2`.

2. **Second Row**:
   - `0` at position (1, 1) is adjacent to `2` at (1, 0) and (1, 2), so it becomes `1`.
   - `0` at position (1, 6) is adjacent to `2` at (1, 7), so it becomes `1`.
   - `0` at position (1, 8) is adjacent to `2` at (1, 9), so it becomes `1`.
   - `0` at position (1, 11) is adjacent to `2` at (1, 10) and (1, 12), so it becomes `1`.

3. **Third Row**:
   - `0` at position (2, 1) is adjacent to `2` at (2, 2), so it becomes `1`.
   - `0` at position (2, 2) is adjacent to `2` at (2, 3), so it becomes `1`.
   - `0` at position (2, 6) is adjacent to `2` at (2, 7), so it becomes `1`.
   - `0` at position (2, 8) is adjacent to `2` at (2, 9), so it becomes `1`.
   - `0` at position (2, 11) is adjacent to `2` at (2, 12), so it becomes `1`.
   - `0` at position (2, 12) is adjacent to `2` at (2, 13), so it becomes `1`.

4. **Fourth Row**:
   - All `0`s remain `0` as they are not adjacent to any non-zero values.

5. **Fifth to Seventh Rows**:
   - All `0`s remain `0` as they are not adjacent to any non-zero values.

6. **Eighth Row**:
   - `0` at position (7, 2) is adjacent to `5` at (7, 1) and (7, 3), so it becomes `1`.
   - `0` at position (7, 6) is adjacent to `5` at (7, 7), so it becomes `1`.
   - `0` at position (7, 10) is adjacent to `5` at (7, 9) and (7, 11), so it becomes `1`.

7. **Ninth Row**:
   - `0` at position (8, 4) is adjacent to `5` at (8, 5), so it becomes `1`.
   - `0` at position (8, 6) is adjacent to `5` at (8, 7), so it becomes `1`.
   - `0` at position (8, 10) is adjacent to `5` at (8, 9) and (8, 11), so it becomes `1`.

8. **Tenth Row**:
   - `0` at position (9, 4) is adjacent to `5` at (9, 5), so it becomes `1`.
   - `0` at position (9, 6) is adjacent to `5` at (9, 7), so it becomes `1`.

88a10436,"To determine the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's analyze the changes step-by-step:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The pattern `2, 2, 1` in the second row and `0, 1, 3` in the third row moves down diagonally to form a new pattern in the fifth and sixth rows.
   - The pattern `5` in the sixth row moves down diagonally to the seventh and eighth rows.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The pattern `6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2` in the first three rows moves down diagonally to the fifth, sixth, and seventh rows.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The pattern `5` in the third row moves down diagonally to the second row.
   - The pattern `2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1` in the seventh and eighth rows moves up diagonally to the second and third rows.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Patterns of non-zero numbers move diagonally downwards or upwards depending on their initial position.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

### Test Case Analysis:
- The pattern `2, 2` in the third row and `1, 1` in the fourth row should move diagonally downwards.
- The pattern `3, 3` in the fifth row should also move diagonally downwards.
- The pattern `5` in the ninth row should move diagonally downwards.

Applying these transformations:

23581191,"To solve the puzzle, we need to identify the transformation rule applied in the training examples and apply it to the test case.

### Analysis of the Transformation Rule:

1. **Identify Non-Zero Elements**:
   - In both training examples, the non-zero elements are 8 and 7.
   
2. **Transformation of Non-Zero Elements**:
   - Each 8 and 7 in the input grid is surrounded by a specific pattern in the output grid.
   - For an 8, the pattern is:
     ```
     [8, 8, 8]
     [8, 8, 8]
     [8, 8, 8]
     ```
   - For a 7, the pattern is:
     ```
     [7, 7, 7]
     [7, 2, 7]
     [7, 7, 7]
     ```

3. **Placement of Patterns**:
   - The patterns are centered around the original positions of the 8s and 7s.
   - If a 7 is directly adjacent to an 8, the 2 in the 7's pattern is replaced by an 8.

### Applying the Transformation Rule to the Test Case:

f8b3ba0a,"The pattern in the provided examples suggests that the output grid consists of three numbers, which are the distinct colors in the input grid that appear in the center of 3x3 blocks of identical colors. Let's break down the transformation:

- Each row in the output grid seems to correspond to one of these colors.
- The order in which the colors appear in the output grid is not clear from the examples alone, but it appears to be the order in which the colors first appear in the input grid when scanning left-to-right and top-to-bottom.

Let's apply this reasoning to the test case:

**Identifying the distinct colors in the center of 3x3 blocks:**
- The first color we see in the center of a 3x3 block is `2`.
- The second color is `4`.
- The third color is `1`.
- The fourth color is `8`.

Thus, the output should be:
```
[
[2],
[4],
[1],
[8]
]
```

However, since the output in the examples only contains three numbers, we need to select the first three distinct colors we encounter. Therefore, the final answer is:

6e82a1ae,"After analyzing the given examples, the transformation rule appears to be that every connected region of the value `5` in the input grid is replaced with a different sequential number starting from `1`. Each distinct region of `5`s is given its own unique number.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5],
[0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

We can see there are four distinct regions of `5`s:
1. Top-right corner
2. Middle-left group
3. Bottom-left group
4. Bottom-right group

Applying the transformation rule, we replace each region with a unique number starting from `1`:

- **Example 1:** The output contains the numbers 4, 6, and 8, which are the non-zero numbers present in the input grid.
- **Example 2:** The output contains the numbers 9 and 4, which are the non-zero numbers present in the input grid.
- **Example 3:** The output contains the number 2, which is the only non-zero number present in the input grid.
- **Example 4:** The output contains the number 8, which is the only non-zero number present in the input grid.

- **Example 6:** The output contains the numbers 1, 4, and 8, which are the non-zero numbers present in the input grid.

### Transformation Rule:
The transformation rule appears to be extracting the unique non-zero numbers from the input grid and forming a new grid where each row is a repetition of these numbers.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
The unique non-zero numbers in the test case input are 1, 5, 9, 8, and 2.

Thus, the output should be a grid where each row contains these numbers in the order they appear in the input.

1. **Pattern Recognition**: 
   - The input contains blocks of `5`s.
   - The output contains the same blocks of `5`s but also introduces new numbers `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` around these blocks.
   
2. **Positioning of New Numbers**:
   - The numbers `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` appear to form a boundary around the blocks of `5`s.
   - Specifically:
     - `1` appears above the top-left corner of the block.
     - `2` appears above the top-right corner of the block.
     - `3` appears below the bottom-left corner of the block.
     - `4` appears below the bottom-right corner of the block.

### Example Analysis

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     [
     [7, 7, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0],
     [7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0],

     [7, 7, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0],
     [0, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0]]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [0, 0, 3],
     [3, 3, 3],
     [0, 0, 3],

     [0, 7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 5]]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0],
     [3, 0, 3],
     [0, 3, 0]]
     ```

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input:

   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [0, 0, 3],
     [0, 3, 0],
     [0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0]]
     ```

### Transformation Rule

From the examples, it appears that the transformation rule is as follows:
- The output grid is a 3x4 grid.
- Each cell in the output grid corresponds to a 3x3 subgrid in the input grid.
- If the subgrid contains the number 5, the corresponding cell in the output grid is set to 3.
- Otherwise, the cell in the output grid is set to 0.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case

Given the test case:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0],
[7, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0],
[7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5]]
```

We need to divide this into 3x3 subgrids and apply the rule:

1. **First 3x3 subgrid:**
   ```
   [0, 0, 0]
   [7, 7, 7]
   [0, 0, 0]
   ```
   - No 5s present, so the output cell is 0.

2. **Second 3x3 subgrid:**
   ```
   [1, 0, 5]
   [1, 5, 5]
   [1, 5, 0]
   ```
   - Contains 5s, so the output cell is 3.

3. **Third 3x3 subgrid:**
   ```
   [0, 5, 0]
   [0, 5, 0]
   [0, 5, 5]
   ```
   - Contains 5s, so the output cell is 3.

4. **Fourth 3x3 subgrid:**
   ```
   [0, 0, 0]
   [7, 0, 0]
   [7, 5, 5]
   ```
   - Contains 5s, so the output cell is 3.

Thus, the output grid for the test case is:
```
[
[0, 3],
[3, 3],
[0, 3],
[3, 3]]
```

However, since the output grid should be 4x3, we need to adjust the dimensions accordingly:
```
[
[0, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 3],
[0, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 3]]
```

Final Answer:
```
[
[0, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 3],
[0, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 3]]

543a7ed5,"To solve the problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let's analyze the provided examples:

### Example 1:
- **Input:** A grid with mostly 8s and some 6s.
- **Output:** The 6s are surrounded by 3s, and some 6s are replaced by 4s.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** Similar to Example 1, but with more 6s and different arrangements.
- **Output:** Again, 6s are surrounded by 3s, and some 6s are replaced by 4s.

### General Pattern:
1. **Surrounding 6s with 3s:** Any 6 that has an 8 adjacent to it (horizontally or vertically) is surrounded by 3s.
2. **Replacing 6s with 4s:** Some 6s that are not surrounded by 3s are replaced by 4s.
3. **Preserving 8s:** 8s remain unchanged unless they are part of the surrounding process.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:

#### Step-by-Step Transformation:
1. **Surround 6s with 3s:**
   - For the 6s in row 3, columns 10-12: Surround them with 3s.
   - For the 6s in row 4, columns 3-7 and 10-12: Surround them with 3s.
   - For the 6s in row 5, columns 3, 6, 10, and 12: Surround them with 3s.
   - For the 6s in row 6, columns 3, 6, 10, and 12: Surround them with 3s.
   - For the 6s in row 7, columns 3-7 and 10, 12: Surround them with 3s.
   - For the 6s in row 8, columns 10-12: Surround them with 3s.
   - For the 6s in row 12, columns 5-11: Surround them with 3s.
   - For the 6s in row 13, columns 5-7 and 10-12: Surround them with 3s.
   - For the 6s in row 14, columns 5-11: Surround them with 3s.

2. **Replace some 6s with 4s:**
   - Replace the 6s that are not surrounded by 3s with 4s.

794b24be,"To solve the test case, let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided examples:

- In all the examples, only the first row is affected, while the rest of the rows remain unchanged.
- In the first row, any cell that has a `1` in the corresponding column of the input grid is changed to a `2` in the output grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[

- First row: 
  - Column 1: 0 (unchanged)
  - Column 2: 1 (changes to 2)
  - Column 3: 0 (unchanged)

So, the first row in the output should be `[0, 2, 0]`.

The rest of the rows remain unchanged.

2. **Preserving the Inner Structure**: After removing the zeros on the edges, the structure of the remaining numbers (8s and 5s) is preserved in the output.

dc433765,"Let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided examples:

1. In all examples, the only non-zero values in the input grid are 3 and 4.
2. The transformation moves the number 3 to the leftmost possible position in its row while keeping the number 4 in its original position.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- The number 3 is in the third row, fourth column. It should be moved to the first non-zero position in that row, which is the third row, second column.
- The number 4 is in the ninth row, fourth column. It remains in its original position.

Therefore, the transformed test case would be:

25d487eb,"To solve the test case, let's first analyze the transformation rules applied in the training examples:

### Example 1 Analysis:
- **Input:** A grid with a small shape formed by the numbers `2` and `1`.
- **Output:** The number `1` in the shape extends horizontally to fill the entire row.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input:** A grid with a larger shape formed by the number `8` and a single `3`.
- **Output:** The number `3` extends vertically upwards to fill the entire column.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- **Input:** A grid with a shape formed by the numbers `3` and `2`.
- **Output:** The number `2` extends vertically downwards to fill the entire column.

### General Rule:
- If there is a non-zero number in a row or column, it extends to fill either the entire row (if it's the only non-zero number in that row) or the entire column (if it's the only non-zero number in that column).

- **Transformation:**
  - The number `4` in the 12th row extends horizontally to fill the entire row.
  - The number `4` in the 13th row extends horizontally to fill the entire row.
  - The number `4` in the 14th row extends horizontally to fill the entire row.
  - The number `4` in the 15th row extends horizontally to fill the entire row.

### Analysis of Examples

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: Contains 8s in various positions.
   - Output: Some 8s are removed, specifically those that are not part of a vertical or horizontal line of 8s.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Contains 6s in various positions.
   - Output: Some 6s are removed, specifically those that are not part of a vertical or horizontal line of 6s.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: Contains 5s in various positions.
   - Output: Some 5s are removed, specifically those that are not part of a vertical or horizontal line of 5s.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: Contains 4s in various positions.
   - Output: Some 4s are removed, specifically those that are not part of a vertical or horizontal line of 4s.

### Transformation Rule
The rule seems to be: **Remove any number that does not form a continuous vertical or horizontal line with at least one other identical number.**

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case

  ```

**Observation:**
- Rows with the same non-zero elements are merged into one row, and the rest of the rows are filled with zeros.

### Transformation Rule
The transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify rows with the same non-zero elements.
- Merge these rows into one row.
- Fill the rest of the rows with zeros.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case

**Test Case:**
- **Input:**
  ```

  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```

**Transformation:**
- Rows 1 and 2 have the same non-zero elements [2, 2] and are merged.
- Rows 6 and 7 have the same non-zero elements [4, 4] and are merged.
- Rows 3 and 4 have the same non-zero elements [1, 1, 2] and are merged.
- Row 5 remains as it is.
- Row 8 remains as it is.

**Output:**
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

However, since rows 6 and 7 are merged, we should only keep one of them. So the final output should be:

db3e9e38,"To solve the provided puzzle, we need to observe the pattern in the given training examples and apply the same transformation rule to the test case.

### Observations:
1. **Pattern of `7`**:
   - In both examples, the `7`s form a vertical line in the input.
   - In the output, the `7`s are retained, but there is a surrounding pattern of `8`s that appears around the `7`s, extending outward.

2. **Surrounding Pattern**:
   - The `8`s form a diagonal pattern starting from the top-left corner and moving towards the bottom-right corner.
   - The number of `8`s decreases as you move away from the `7`s, forming a triangular shape.

3. **Non-affected Areas**:
   - Areas that do not have `7`s remain unchanged or become `0` if they are outside the influence of the `7`s.

### Applying the Transformation to the Test Case:
- The input has a vertical line of `7`s starting from the 6th column.
- We need to create a similar pattern of `8`s around these `7`s, starting from the top-left corner and moving diagonally.

Let's construct the output step-by-step:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Retain the `7`s in their original positions.
   - Start adding `8`s in a diagonal pattern from the top-left corner, decreasing as we move away from the `7`s.

2. **Constructing the Output**:
   - The first few rows will have `8`s extending diagonally from the top-left.
   - As we move down, the number of `8`s will decrease until they no longer affect the grid.

Here is the final output:

### Example 1:
- **Input**: A large grid with mostly zeros and some 8s and 2s.
- **Output**: A 3x3 grid with 8s forming a cross pattern.

### Example 2:
- **Input**: A large grid with mostly zeros and some 4s, 1s, and 2s.
- **Output**: A 3x3 grid with 4s forming a cross pattern.

### Example 3:
- **Input**: A large grid with mostly zeros and some 8s and 6s.
- **Output**: A 3x3 grid with 8s forming a cross pattern.

From these examples, we can infer that:
- The output is a 3x3 grid.
- The non-zero values in the output form a cross pattern.
- The value in the cross pattern is the most frequent non-zero value in the input grid.

### Test Case:
- **Input**: A large grid with mostly zeros and some 3s, 2s, and 8s.

Let's apply the inferred rule to the test case:
1. Identify the most frequent non-zero value in the input grid.
2. Create a 3x3 grid with this value forming a cross pattern.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Identify the most frequent non-zero value**:
   - Count the occurrences of each non-zero value:
     - 3: 6 times
     - 2: 10 times
     - 8: 4 times
   - The most frequent non-zero value is 2.

2. **Create the 3x3 grid with the most frequent value forming a cross pattern**:
   - The cross pattern in a 3x3 grid is:

7e0986d6,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the transformation rule applied in the training examples. By examining the changes, we can deduce the following:

1. **Color Filtering**: The primary color that remains unchanged in the output is 3 in Example 1 and 2 in Example 2. In both cases, other colors (like 8 and 1) are removed or replaced with 0.
2. **Background Handling**: The background color (0) remains unchanged.
3. **Shape Preservation**: The shapes formed by the primary color (3 or 2) are preserved, but any other colors within those shapes are converted to 0.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- The primary color in the test case appears to be 5.
- We will remove all other colors except 5 and 0.

d13f3404,"To solve the test case, we need to understand the pattern in the transformation from the input to the output grids based on the provided examples.

### Observations:
1. **Grid Expansion**: 
   - The output grid has twice the number of rows and columns as the input grid.
   
2. **Pattern of Shifting**:
   - The elements of the input grid are shifted diagonally to the right and down in the output grid.
   - Each element in the input grid appears in the top-left corner of a 2x2 block in the output grid.
   - The elements of the input grid are repeated in a diagonal pattern, with zeros filling the remaining positions.

### Example Analysis:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `[[6, 1, 0], [3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`
  - Output: 
    ```
    [
    [6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [3, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 3, 6, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 3, 6, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6]
    ]
    ```
  - The pattern shows that each element in the input grid is repeated diagonally, shifted one position to the right and down.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `[[0, 4, 0], [0, 8, 0], [2, 0, 0]]`
  - Output: 
    ```
    [
    [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0],
    [2, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0],
    [0, 2, 0, 8, 4, 0],
    [0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 4],
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8]
    ]
    ```
  - Similar pattern, with elements shifted diagonally.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `[[0, 0, 6], [1, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`
  - Output: 
    ```
    [
    [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 3, 0, 6, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 6],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3]
    ]
    ```
  - Again, the same diagonal shifting pattern is observed.

### Applying the Pattern to the Test Case:
- **Input**:
  - `[[0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 9]]`

- **Output Construction**:
  - The output grid should have 6 rows and 6 columns.
  - Each element in the input grid will be shifted diagonally to the right and down.

  - Constructing the output step-by-step:
    - Start with the first row of the input grid: `[0, 0, 3]`
      - This becomes the first row of the output grid: `[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]`
    - Shift the second row of the input grid: `[0, 0, 0]`
      - This becomes the second row of the output grid: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    - Shift the third row of the input grid: `[0, 4, 9]`
      - This becomes the third row of the output grid: `[0, 4, 9, 0, 0, 0]`
    - Continue the pattern for the remaining rows:
      - Fourth row: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
      - Fifth row: `[0, 0, 0, 4, 9, 0]`
      - Sixth row: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]`

3. **Row 3**: The number 7 spreads to the right.
   - Result: `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`
4. **Row 4**: No non-zero numbers, so no change.
   - Result: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
5. **Row 5**: The number 2 spreads to the right.
   - Result: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]`
6. **Row 6**: No non-zero numbers, so no change.
   - Result: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

- The outermost layer of the grid is filled with the value `8`.
- All other positions remain unchanged or retain their original value (in the given examples, this is `0`).

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

### Test Case
Input:
```

1. **Outermost Layer**:
   - The first and last rows are filled with `8`.
   - The first and last columns are filled with `8`.

2. **Inner Layer**:
   - The rest of the grid remains `0`.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Pattern of 5s and 8s:**
   - In both examples, areas where `5`s form a continuous shape are replaced with `8`s, except for the outermost layer of `5`s.
   - The outermost layer of `5`s remains unchanged.

2. **Transformation Rule:**
   - Identify the continuous shape formed by `5`s.
   - Replace all inner `5`s (those not on the boundary) with `8`s.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:

Let's apply the identified rule to the test case:

- Identify the continuous shape formed by `5`s.
- Replace all inner `5`s with `8`s, leaving the boundary `5`s unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Transformation:

1. **Identify the shape:**
   - The `5`s form a cross-like shape with an additional horizontal bar at the top and bottom.

2. **Replace inner `5`s with `8`s:**
   - The inner `5`s in the middle of the cross and the top and bottom bars should be replaced with `8`s.

### Analysis of the Transformation Rule

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** A small pattern of `4` and `2` in the middle.
   - **Output:** The `4`s are expanded outwards in a diagonal pattern, forming a larger triangle.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** A small pattern of `3` and `2` in the top-left corner.
   - **Output:** The `3`s are expanded outwards in a diagonal pattern, forming a larger triangle.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** A small pattern of `6` and `2` in the middle.
   - **Output:** The `6`s are expanded outwards in a diagonal pattern, forming a larger triangle.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** A small pattern of `2`, `2`, and `7` in the middle.
   - **Output:** The `7`s are expanded outwards in a diagonal pattern, forming a larger triangle.

### General Pattern:
- The non-zero numbers (other than `2`) in the input grid expand outwards diagonally to form a larger triangle.
- The expansion starts from the top-left corner of the smallest bounding box that contains the non-zero numbers.
- The expansion continues until the entire grid is filled or the triangle reaches the edge of the grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- The input grid has a small pattern of `2` and `8` in the middle-right part.
- The `8` should expand outwards in a diagonal pattern, forming a larger triangle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. Identify the smallest bounding box containing the non-zero numbers: `[[2, 2], [8, 2]]`.
2. Expand the `8` outwards diagonally starting from the top-left corner of this bounding box.

### Result:
The `8` expands to form a larger triangle, filling the grid as follows:

### Observations:
1. **Color 8:** This color acts as a boundary or a wall that limits the spread of the transformation.
2. **Color 3:** This color appears in areas where there are no 8s and where 0s are present. It seems to fill in the gaps or ""holes"" formed by the other colors.
3. **Spread of Color 3:** The color 3 spreads from the boundaries (where 0s are adjacent to 8s) inward until it reaches another non-zero value (like 2).

### Steps to Apply the Transformation:
1. Identify the regions enclosed by 8s.
2. Within these regions, replace all 0s with 3s.
3. Ensure that 3s do not spread beyond the boundaries of 8s.

239be575,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples provided:

- In Example 1, the output is `[ [0] ]`. This suggests the color `0` is significant.
- In Example 2, the output is `[ [8] ]`. This suggests the color `8` is significant.
- In Example 3, the output is `[ [8] ]`. Again, the color `8` is significant.
- In Example 4, the output is `[ [0] ]`. The color `0` is significant again.
- In Example 5, the output is `[ [8] ]`. The color `8` is significant once more.
- In Example 6, the output is `[ [0] ]`. The color `0` is significant again.

From these observations, it seems that the output is determined by the most common non-zero color in the input grid. If there is no non-zero color, or if zero is the most common, the output is `[ [0] ]`.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Input:
```
[
[2, 2, 8, 8, 0, 8],
[2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8],
[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],
[8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8],
[0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 0],
[8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0],
[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]
]
```

Count the occurrences of each non-zero color:
- Color `2`: 6 times
- Color `8`: 18 times

The most common non-zero color is `8`.

Therefore, the output should be:
Answer: ``` [ [8] ] ```",[[8]],True,True,1.0
d4469b4b,"To solve this, let's analyze the pattern in the transformations:

1. **Grid Size and Position**: The output grids are always 3x3 matrices, regardless of the input size.
2. **Color Transformation**: In all the examples, the number 5 appears prominently in the output. This suggests that the non-zero elements from the input might be transformed into 5s in the output.
3. **Pattern Identification**: The placement of 5s in the output seems to correspond to the relative positions of the non-zero elements in the input. Specifically, the 3x3 output grid seems to capture a central ""core"" or ""cluster"" of the non-zero elements from the input.

Let's break down the test case:

**Test Case Input:**
```
[
[1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
]
```

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Identify the Central Cluster**: The central cluster of non-zero elements in the input grid is:
   ```
   [
   [1, 1, 1],
   [0, 1, 0],
   [0, 1, 0]
   ]
   ```

2. **Transform Non-Zero Elements**: Replace the non-zero elements with 5s:
   ```
   [
   [5, 5, 5],
   [0, 5, 0],
   [0, 5, 0]
   ]
   ```

This matches the pattern observed in the training examples. Therefore, the output for the test case should be:

Answer: ``` [[5, 5, 5], [0, 5, 0], [0, 5, 0]] ```","[[5 5 5]
 [0 5 0]
 [0 5 0]]",True,True,0.56
90f3ed37,"To solve the test case, we need to observe the pattern in the provided training examples. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Observation**: In all the examples, the transformation introduces the color `1` in specific patterns.
2. **Pattern**: The color `1` appears below or to the right of the color `8`, forming a line that extends horizontally or vertically based on the presence of `8`.

Let's apply this pattern to the test case:

- **Row 2**: Contains a sequence of `8`s. We should extend `1`s below this row.
- **Row 4**: Contains another sequence of `8`s. We should extend `1`s below this row as well.
- **Row 9**: Contains a sequence of `8`s, but only two `8`s. We should extend `1`s below these two `8`s.
- **Row 10**: Contains a sequence of `8`s, but only three `8`s. We should extend `1`s below these three `8`s.
- **Row 11**: Contains a sequence of `8`s, but only two `8`s. We should extend `1`s below these two `8`s.

Applying these transformations, we get the following output:

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - In each example, certain cells that contain a non-zero value (let's call this value `x`) are expanded to their immediate neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) with the same value `x`.

2. **Apply the Rule to Each Example:**
   - **Example 1:** The 8s expand to their immediate neighbors.
   - **Example 2:** The 7s expand to their immediate neighbors.
   - **Example 3:** The 6s expand to their immediate neighbors.

3. **Generalize the Rule:**
   - For any non-zero cell at position `(i, j)` with value `x`, set the cells at positions `(i-1, j)`, `(i+1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i, j+1)` to `x` if they are within the grid bounds and are currently 0.

4. **Apply the Rule to the Test Case:**
   - Identify all non-zero cells and expand them to their immediate neighbors.

  - From `[3, 0]` to `[2, 0]` and `[3, 1]`.
  - From `[4, 0]` to `[3, 0]`, `[5, 0]`, and `[4, 1]`.
  - From `[4, 1]` to `[3, 1]`, `[5, 1]`, and `[4, 2]`.
  - From `[5, 1]` to `[4, 1]`, `[6, 1]`, and `[5, 2]`.

29623171,"To understand the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: The grid contains a row of 5s in the middle with some 1s scattered around.
   - Output: The 1s are replaced with a 1x3 block of 1s in the bottom rows.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: The grid contains a row of 5s in the middle with some 2s scattered around.
   - Output: The 2s are replaced with a 3x3 block of 2s in the relevant areas.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: The grid contains a row of 5s in the middle with some 3s scattered around.
   - Output: The 3s are replaced with a 3x3 block of 3s in the bottom rows.

From these examples, we can deduce the following transformation rule:
- For any non-zero value (other than 5) that appears in the grid, replace it with a 3x3 block of the same value, starting from the position where the non-zero value is found.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

1. **Pattern Identification**:
   - In Example 1, the non-zero elements (8) in the input are mirrored along both the horizontal and vertical axis in the output.
   - In Example 2, the non-zero elements (2) are also mirrored, but they form a larger pattern with additional rows and columns of zeros.
   - In Example 3, the pattern is similar, but with different non-zero values (5).

2. **Transformation Rule**:
   - The output grid is a 9x4 grid (3 times the height and twice the width of the input).
   - Each element in the input grid is repeated in a specific pattern in the output grid:
     - The first row of the input becomes the 1st, 5th, and 9th rows in the output.
     - The second row of the input becomes the 3rd, 6th, and 8th rows in the output.
     - The third row of the input becomes the 2nd, 7th, and 4th rows in the output.
   - The columns are duplicated and mirrored horizontally.

3. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**:
   - Input grid:
     ```
     [3, 3],
     [3, 0],
     [3, 3]

   - Following the pattern:
     - The first row [3, 3] will appear in the 1st, 5th, and 9th rows.
     - The second row [3, 0] will appear in the 3rd, 6th, and 8th rows.
     - The third row [3, 3] will appear in the 2nd, 7th, and 4th rows.
   - Duplicating and mirroring the columns:
     - [3, 3] becomes [3, 3, 3, 3]
     - [3, 0] becomes [3, 0, 0, 3]

4. **Constructing the Output Grid**:
   - The final output grid will be:

- Expand this rectangle to the largest possible size within the grid, filling the new area with the color of the innermost non-zero element.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:

**Input:**
```

[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

1. **Identify the smallest rectangle containing all non-zero elements:**
   - The smallest rectangle is from row 1 (index 0) to row 12 (index 11) and column 4 (index 3) to column 7 (index 7).

2. **Expand this rectangle to the largest possible size:**
   - The largest possible size within the grid is from row 0 to row 12 and column 0 to column 12.

3. **Fill the new area with the color of the innermost non-zero element:**
   - The innermost non-zero element is `6` (since it forms the boundary of the inner rectangle).

**Output:**

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:
- Test Input:
  ```
  [0, 8, 0]
  [8, 8, 8]
  [0, 8, 0]
  ```

- Center element: 8
- Non-zero neighbors: 8 (all surrounding elements are 8)

Thus, the output should be:

cdecee7f,"To solve the problem, let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided examples.

### Analysis of the Transformation Rule

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: A 10x10 grid with some non-zero values scattered.
   - Output: A 3x3 grid containing specific non-zero values from the input grid.
   - Non-zero values in the output grid: 3, 1, 8, 9, 7, 6.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Another 10x10 grid with different non-zero values.
   - Output: A 3x3 grid containing specific non-zero values from the input grid.
   - Non-zero values in the output grid: 9, 3, 4, 5, 8, 6, 2.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: A third 10x10 grid with different non-zero values.
   - Output: A 3x3 grid containing specific non-zero values from the input grid.
   - Non-zero values in the output grid: 2, 4, 5, 1, 9, 3, 5, 1, 3.

### Observations:
- The output grid is always a 3x3 grid.
- The non-zero values in the output grid are taken from the input grid, but their positions in the output grid are not the same as their positions in the input grid.
- The non-zero values seem to be collected in a specific order and placed in the 3x3 grid.

### Hypothesis:
- The non-zero values are collected in a row-major order from the input grid and placed in the 3x3 output grid in the same order.

### Verification:
- **Example 1:**
  - Non-zero values in row-major order: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9.
  - Placed in the 3x3 grid: 
    - First row: 3, 1, 8
    - Second row: 9, 7, 6
    - Third row: 0, 0, 0 (since there are only 6 non-zero values)

- **Example 2:**
  - Non-zero values in row-major order: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.
  - Placed in the 3x3 grid: 
    - First row: 9, 3, 4
    - Second row: 5, 8, 6
    - Third row: 2, 0, 0 (since there are only 7 non-zero values)

- **Example 3:**
  - Non-zero values in row-major order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9.
  - Placed in the 3x3 grid: 
    - First row: 2, 4, 5
    - Second row: 1, 9, 3
    - Third row: 5, 1, 3

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Test Case Input:**
  - Non-zero values in row-major order: 5, 9, 1, 2, 6, 3, 5, 4, 9.
  - Placed in the 3x3 grid:
    - First row: 5, 9, 1
    - Second row: 2, 6, 3
    - Third row: 5, 4, 9

### Observations:
- The output grid is a 3x3 grid.
- The output grid seems to contain the center elements of the 3x3 sub-grids from the input grid.
- The 3x3 sub-grids are extracted from the input grid by taking every third row and column starting from the first row and column.

### Transformation Rule:
- Extract the center element (the element at position (1, 1) in a 3x3 sub-grid) from each 3x3 sub-grid of the input grid.
- Arrange these center elements into a new 3x3 grid.

**Output:**
```

]
```

### Analysis:
- The output grid is a smaller version of the input grid.
- The output grid seems to extract a central part of the input grid.
- The central part is determined by the non-1 values in the input grid.

### Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the smallest rectangle that contains all non-1 values.
2. Extract this rectangle from the input grid to form the output grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
**Input:**
```
[
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
]
```

- The smallest rectangle containing all non-1 values is from row 2 to row 3 and column 3 to column 4 (0-based indexing).

**Output:**
```
[
[1, 2],
[2, 3]
]
```

However, we need to adjust the indices to match the actual positions in the grid:
- Row 2 to row 3 (0-based) corresponds to rows 3 to 4 (1-based).
- Column 3 to column 4 (0-based) corresponds to columns 4 to 5 (1-based).

Thus, the correct output is:
```
[
[2, 3]
]
```

### Final Answer:
Answer: ```

673ef223,"To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids. Let's analyze the examples provided:

### Observations:
1. **Color 8 Transformation**:
   - When an 8 is present in the grid, it seems to ""expand"" vertically and horizontally, forming a cross with 8s.
   - The expansion stops at the boundaries of the grid or when it encounters other non-zero values.
   - The expansion also seems to convert adjacent 2s to 4s.

2. **Color 2 Transformation**:
   - 2s remain unchanged unless they are adjacent to an expanded 8, in which case they become 4s.

### Steps to Transform:
1. **Identify and Expand 8s**:
   - For each 8 in the grid, expand it vertically and horizontally until it reaches the boundary or another non-zero value.
   - Convert any 2s that are adjacent to the expanded 8s to 4s.

2. **Finalize the Grid**:
   - After expanding the 8s and converting the adjacent 2s to 4s, the grid should be complete.

### Applying the Transformation to the Test Case:

### Step-by-Step Transformation:

1. **Expand 8 at (2, 8)**:
   - Expand vertically and horizontally:
     - (2, 7) -> 4
     - (3, 8) -> 8
     - (2, 9) -> 8
     - (1, 8) -> 8
     - (2, 6) -> 8

2. **Expand 8 at (3, 7)**:
   - Expand vertically and horizontally:
     - (3, 6) -> 8
     - (2, 7) -> 4 (already 4)
     - (4, 7) -> 8
     - (3, 8) -> 4
     - (3, 5) -> 8

3. **Expand 8 at (5, 4)**:
   - Expand vertically and horizontally:
     - (5, 3) -> 8
     - (5, 5) -> 8
     - (4, 4) -> 8
     - (6, 4) -> 8
     - (5, 2) -> 8

4. **Finalize the Grid**:
   - Convert 2s adjacent to 8s to 4s.

d631b094,"To solve the test case, let's analyze the transformation based on the training examples provided:

1. Example 1 shows that a 3x3 grid with 1s in positions (1,0) and (2,1) results in a 1x2 grid with 1s.
2. Example 2 has 2s at positions (0,1), (1,0), and (2,1), leading to a 1x3 grid filled with 2s.
3. Example 3 simplifies a 3x3 grid with a single 7 at position (0,1) to a 1x1 grid with 7.
4. Example 4, which has 8s at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), and (2,0), produces a 1x4 grid filled with 8s.

The pattern seems to indicate that the output is a 1D array where each element corresponds to a non-zero value from the input, and the order of the elements in the output follows the path of the non-zero values in the input, row by row.

Applying this to the test case:
- The non-zero values are 4s located at positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), and (2,2).
- Following the row-by-row order, we get the sequence [4, 4, 4, 4, 4].

### Transformation Rule Analysis:
- The output grid is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions.
- Each cell in the input grid is repeated in a 2x2 block in the output grid.

### Applying the Transformation Rule to the Test Case:
- **Test Case Input**:
  ```
  [4, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 4],
  [4, 4, 0, 0]
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  - Each element in the input grid will be repeated in a 2x2 block in the output grid.

Let's construct the output grid step by step:

1. **First Row**:
   - `[4, 0, 0, 0]` becomes:
     ```
     [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     ```

2. **Second Row**:
   - `[0, 0, 0, 4]` becomes:
     ```
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]
     ```

3. **Third Row**:
   - `[4, 4, 0, 0]` becomes:
     ```
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     ```

Combining these, the final output grid is:
```
[4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4],
[4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

31aa019c,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

### Example 1:
- **Input:** There are various numbers scattered throughout the grid.
- **Output:** The output grid has a 3x3 block of `2`s starting from the bottom-left corner.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** Again, there are various numbers scattered throughout the grid.
- **Output:** The output grid has a 3x3 block of `2`s starting from the middle-right part of the grid.

### Example 3:
- **Input:** Various numbers scattered throughout the grid.
- **Output:** The output grid has a 3x3 block of `2`s starting from the bottom-middle part of the grid.

### Common Pattern:
- In all examples, the output grid contains a 3x3 block of `2`s.
- The position of this block seems to be determined by the presence of specific numbers in the input grid.

### Hypothesis:
- The 3x3 block of `2`s appears where there is a cluster of non-zero numbers in the input grid.
- The exact position of the block is centered around the first non-zero number found in a row or column that has a cluster of non-zero numbers.

### Test Case Analysis:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
  [7, 4, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],
  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 0, 0],
  [5, 5, 0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 7, 0, 7],
  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7]
  ]
  ```

- **Cluster Identification:**
  - The largest cluster of non-zero numbers is in the middle of the grid, specifically around the 5th and 6th rows and the 1st to 4th columns.
  - This suggests that the 3x3 block of `2`s should be centered around this area.

### Positioning the 3x3 Block:
- The center of the block should be at the position (5, 2) in the grid (1-based indexing).
- Therefore, the top-left corner of the 3x3 block should be at (4, 1).

### Final Output:
- The 3x3 block of `2`s will be placed starting from the position (4, 1).

### Observations:
1. The output grid is smaller than the input grid.
2. The output grid seems to be a 6x6 grid.
3. The values in the output grid are derived from the input grid but not directly mapped.

### Hypothesis:
- The output grid is formed by selecting specific cells from the input grid.
- The selected cells might be at fixed positions relative to the 8s in the input grid.
- The 8s in the input grid seem to act as anchors or markers.

### Transformation Rule:
- For each 8 in the input grid, consider a 3x3 block centered around the 8.
- Take the top-left 2x2 corner of each 3x3 block and place it in the output grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input:**
  ```

- **Output:**
  - Identify the 3x3 blocks centered around each 8.

8be77c9e,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids. Let's analyze the provided examples:

### Example 1 Analysis:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [1, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [
  [1, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 0]
  ]
  ```

The output appears to be the input grid followed by its mirror image reflected along the horizontal axis.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 0]
  ]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```

  [1, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 0]

  ```

Again, the output is the input grid followed by its mirror image reflected along the horizontal axis.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 1]
  ]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [

  [0, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```

The same pattern holds: the output is the input grid followed by its mirror image reflected along the horizontal axis.

### General Transformation Rule:
The transformation rule is to append the mirror image of the input grid (reflected along the horizontal axis) to the bottom of the original input grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1],
  [1, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```

- **Mirror Image:**
  ```
  [
  [1, 0, 0],

- **Output:**
  ```

Thus, the correct answer for the test case is:
Answer:

2bcee788,"To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the transformation rule applied in the examples. Let's analyze the examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input has a small shape formed by numbers 4 and 2.
   - Output has the same shape but surrounded by 3s.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input has a different shape formed by numbers 2 and 6.
   - Output has the same shape but surrounded by 3s.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input has a shape formed by numbers 2 and 7.
   - Output has the same shape but surrounded by 3s.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input has a shape formed by numbers 8 and 2.
   - Output has the same shape but surrounded by 3s.

From these examples, we can deduce that the transformation rule is:
- All cells that are not part of the original shape (i.e., cells with value 0) are changed to 3.
- Cells that are part of the original shape retain their values.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case Input:**

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

**Transformation:**
- Change all 0s to 3s.
- Keep the original values (1 and 2) in their respective positions.

### Example 1 Analysis:
- **Input:** 
  - The top-left corner has a sequence `[2, 8, 3]`.
  - The rest of the grid is filled with zeros.
- **Output:**
  - The entire grid is tiled with the repeating sequence `[2, 8, 3]`.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input:**
  - The bottom-right corner has a sequence `[1, 2, 4]`.
  - The rest of the grid is filled with zeros.
- **Output:**
  - The entire grid is tiled with the repeating sequence `[1, 2, 4]`.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- **Input:**

  - The rest of the grid is filled with zeros.
- **Output:**
  - The entire grid is tiled with the repeating sequence `[8, 3, 4]`.

### General Rule:
- The transformation rule appears to be that the non-zero values in the input grid are used to form a repeating pattern that fills the entire output grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input:**
  - Non-zero values form the sequence `[1, 2, 4]` (from the non-zero positions in the input).
- **Output:**
  - The entire grid should be tiled with the repeating sequence `[1, 2, 4]`.

- **Example 1**: Input has a 4x14 grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid.
- **Example 2**: Similarly, the input is a 4x14 grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid.
- **Example 3**: Again, the input is a 4x14 grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid.
- **Example 4**: The input is a 4x14 grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid.
- **Example 5**: The input is a 4x14 grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid.

In all examples, the output grid is a 4x4 grid. Now, let's look at how the values are selected or transformed:

- **Common Pattern**: The output grid seems to consist of the first four columns of the input grid, but with some modifications.
- **Modification Rule**: If there is a 2 in the 5th column of the input grid, the corresponding row in the output grid takes the value from the 6th column instead of the 4th column.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Step-by-Step Transformation:**

1. **First Row:**
   - 5th column value: 2
   - Use 6th column value: 9
   - Output: [0, 0, 4, 9]

2. **Second Row:**
   - 5th column value: 2
   - Use 6th column value: 9
   - Output: [4, 4, 0, 9]

3. **Third Row:**
   - 5th column value: 2
   - Use 6th column value: 0
   - Output: [0, 0, 0, 0]

- Once more, all `6`s are replaced with `2`s.

### Conclusion:
The transformation rule is to replace all occurrences of `6` with `2`.

d0f5fe59,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Input and Output Analysis:**
   - In all examples, the input grids contain mostly zeros with some 8s forming various shapes.
   - The output grids contain only 8s and zeros, arranged in a specific pattern.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The output grids seem to be a smaller version of the input grids, containing only the 8s that form a diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid.
   - The size of the output grid is determined by the number of 8s that can form such a diagonal line.

3. **Transformation Rule:**
   - For each row in the input grid, if there is an 8 at the position corresponding to the row index (i.e., the i-th row should have an 8 at the i-th column), that 8 is placed in the output grid.
   - If no 8 is found at the correct position, a zero is placed instead.

4. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case:**
   - We need to check each row of the test input grid and place an 8 in the output grid if there is an 8 at the corresponding position.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- Row 1: No 8 at column 1 -> [0]
- Row 2: No 8 at column 2 -> [0, 0]
- Row 3: No 8 at column 3 -> [0, 0, 0]
- Row 4: 8 at column 4 -> [0, 0, 0, 8]
- Row 5: No 8 at column 5 -> [0, 0, 0, 8, 0]
- Row 6: No 8 at column 6 -> [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
- Row 7: No 8 at column 7 -> [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
- Row 8: No 8 at column 8 -> [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
- Row 9: No 8 at column 9 -> [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
- Row 10: 8 at column 10 -> [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
- Row 11: 8 at column 11 -> [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]
- Row 12: No 8 at column 12 -> [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0]

Since the output grid is formed by the first occurrence of 8 in the correct position, we stop at the 11th row where we have a complete diagonal line.

Thus, the final output grid is:
Answer: ``` [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8]] ```","[[0 0 0 0]

662c240a,"To solve this problem, I need to identify the common pattern or rule that has been applied in all the examples provided.

From the given examples:

- Example 1: The output is the bottom left 3x3 section of the input.
- Example 2: The output is the bottom left 3x3 section of the input.
- Example 3: The output is the bottom left 3x3 section of the input.
- Example 4: The output is the top right 3x3 section of the input.

It seems like the transformation rule is to take a 3x3 section of the input grid, but the position of the section changes based on the input. However, the most consistent rule observed in the first three examples is taking the bottom left 3x3 section. Since we have one example (Example 4) where the top right 3x3 section was taken, let's assume the rule is more about taking a specific 3x3 section from the input, with the bottom left being the primary choice unless there's a clear reason to choose another section.

Given the consistency of the bottom left 3x3 section in the first three examples, and without further specific guidance, I'll apply the rule of taking the bottom left 3x3 section for the test case.

Applying this rule to the test case:

**Test Input:**
```

4258a5f9,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the transformation rule applied in the examples:

1. **Identify the Pattern**:
   - In both examples, the number `5` is present at certain positions.
   - Around each `5`, there is a border of `1`s that forms a square or rectangle around the `5`.

2. **Determine the Size of the Border**:
   - The border of `1`s extends one cell in all directions (up, down, left, right) from the position of `5`.
   - If a `5` is near the edge of the grid, the border of `1`s will only extend to the available cells.

3. **Apply the Rule to the Test Case**:
   - Identify the positions of `5` in the test case.
   - For each `5`, create a border of `1`s around it, extending one cell in all directions.

Let's apply this rule step by step to the test case:

- **Position (1, 1)**: `5` is at (1, 1).
  - Border: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)

- **Position (2, 7)**: `5` is at (2, 7).
  - Border: (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)

- **Position (4, 3)**: `5` is at (4, 3).
  - Border: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)

- **Position (7, 1)**: `5` is at (7, 1).
  - Border: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 0), (7, 2), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2)

- **Position (7, 5)**: `5` is at (7, 5).
  - Border: (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 4), (7, 6), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)

Now, let's construct the output grid based on these rules:

```python
[
[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

6d75e8bb,"To determine the transformation rule, I'll analyze the changes in the provided examples.

### Analysis of Transformation Rule:

1. **Color 0 (Background):**
   - Color 0 cells remain unchanged if they are not adjacent to any color 8 cells.

2. **Color 8 (Main Pattern):**
   - Color 8 cells remain as 8 if they are part of the main pattern or are surrounded by other 8s.
   - If a color 8 cell is adjacent to a color 0 cell (horizontally or vertically), it remains 8.

3. **New Color 2:**
   - Cells that are adjacent to color 8 cells but are originally color 0 are changed to color 2.
   - This transformation happens for all cells that are directly horizontal or vertical neighbors of color 8 cells.

### Application to Test Case:

Given the test case:
```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Let's apply the transformation rule:

- **Row 3:** The single 8 at (2, 2) will have its adjacent cells (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2) changed to 2.
- **Row 4:** The 8s at (3, 2) and (3, 6-7) will have their adjacent cells (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 8) changed to 2.
- **Row 5:** The 8s at (4, 2), (4, 4), and (4, 7) will have their adjacent cells (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8) changed to 2.
- **Row 6:** The 8s at (5, 2-4) and (5, 7) will have their adjacent cells (5, 1), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 8) changed to 2.
- **Row 7:** The 8s at (6, 2-4) and (6, 7-8) will have their adjacent cells (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 9) changed to 2.
- **Row 8:** The 8s at (7, 2-8) will have their adjacent cells (7, 1), (7, 9) changed to 2.

Applying these changes, we get the following output:

The largest contiguous block of non-zero values is:

[2, 8, 1, 0],
[8, 8, 8, 0],

2. **Non-overlapping blocks**: If multiple 5s are close to each other, their surrounding 1s do not overlap but form a larger block where necessary.

### Steps to Transform:
1. Identify all positions of the number 5 in the input grid.
2. For each position of 5, create a 3x3 block of 1s centered at that position.
3. Ensure that if multiple 5s are close, their 3x3 blocks merge into a larger block without overlapping.

Transformation:
- Row 1: All zeros, no change.
- Row 2: All zeros, no change.
- Row 3: Non-zero values at indices 2 and 6. Pattern [2, 0, 2] should repeat.
- Row 4: Non-zero values at indices 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. Pattern [6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2] should repeat.
- Row 5: Non-zero values at indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Pattern [6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 6] should repeat.

cce03e0d,"To solve the test case, let's analyze the transformation rule used in the provided examples.

### Analysis of the Transformation Rule

1. **Grid Size Expansion**:
   - Each output grid is a 9x9 grid.
   - The original input grid is placed within this larger grid.

2. **Positioning of the Original Grid**:
   - The original grid is placed such that it is centered in the larger grid.
   - Each row of the original grid is shifted to the right and down by the same number of positions as its row index in the original grid.

3. **Filling the Remaining Cells**:
   - All other cells in the 9x9 grid that are not part of the original grid are filled with zeros.

### Applying the Transformation Rule to the Test Case

Given the test case input:
```
[
[1, 2, 2],
[2, 0, 1],
[1, 2, 0]
]
```

1. **Determine the Position of Each Row**:
   - The first row `[1, 2, 2]` will be placed starting at position (3, 3) in the 9x9 grid.
   - The second row `[2, 0, 1]` will be placed starting at position (4, 4) in the 9x9 grid.
   - The third row `[1, 2, 0]` will be placed starting at position (5, 5) in the 9x9 grid.

2. **Construct the 9x9 Grid**:
   - Initialize a 9x9 grid filled with zeros.
   - Place each row of the original grid in the correct position.

The resulting grid will be:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

22168020,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the transformation rule based on the provided examples. Let's analyze them:

### Example 1:
- **Input:** The input has 3s forming a vertical line.
- **Output:** The 3s are expanded horizontally to form a filled rectangle.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** The input has 1s and 4s forming two separate vertical lines.
- **Output:** Each color (1 and 4) is expanded horizontally to form filled rectangles.

### Example 3:
- **Input:** The input has 6s and 8s forming vertical lines.
- **Output:** Each color (6 and 8) is expanded horizontally to form filled rectangles.

### General Rule:
For each color in the input, the transformation rule is to expand the color horizontally to fill all the cells in the row that have any cell of the same color above or below them.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Row 1:** No expansion needed (all zeros).

3befdf3e,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

### Example 1 Analysis:
- **Input**: A small square of `4` with a `6` in the middle.
- **Output**: The `4`s expand outwards, forming a larger square around the original square. The `6` remains in the center but is surrounded by additional `6`s.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input**: A larger square of `2` with two `7`s in the middle.
- **Output**: The `2`s expand outwards, forming a larger square around the original square. The `7`s remain in the center but are surrounded by additional `7`s.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- **Input**: A square of `3` with a smaller square of `1` in the middle.
- **Output**: The `3`s expand outwards, forming a larger square around the original square. The `1`s remain in the center but are surrounded by additional `1`s.

### General Rule:
- The non-zero numbers in the input form a shape (square, rectangle, etc.).
- The shape expands outward by one cell in all directions.
- The expansion uses the same color as the border of the original shape.
- The inner cells of the shape also expand, maintaining their original values but filling the newly expanded area.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input**: Two separate shapes:
  - A small square of `8` with a `3` in the middle at the top.
  - A larger square of `8` with two `3`s in the middle at the bottom.

### Transformation Steps:
1. **Top Shape**:
   - Expand the `8`s outward by one cell in all directions.
   - The `3` remains in the center but is surrounded by additional `3`s.

2. **Bottom Shape**:
   - Expand the `8`s outward by one cell in all directions.
   - The `3`s remain in the center but are surrounded by additional `3`s.

e21d9049,"To solve the test case, let's first analyze the patterns in the provided examples.

### Observations:
1. **Non-zero Elements**: In both examples, the non-zero elements in the input grid form a small cluster.
2. **Output Pattern**: The output grid replicates the non-zero elements found in the input grid, but in a repeating pattern across the entire grid.
3. **Repetition**: The non-zero elements are repeated horizontally and vertically, filling the entire grid.

### Example Analysis:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: A few non-zero elements at specific positions.
  - Output: These elements are repeated in a pattern across the entire grid.
  
- **Example 2**:
  - Input: A few non-zero elements forming a small cluster.
  - Output: These elements are repeated in a pattern across the entire grid.

### Test Case:
- **Input**:
  - Non-zero elements are at specific positions:
    - [6, 7]: 4
    - [7, 5]: 4
    - [7, 6]: 2
    - [7, 7]: 3
    - [7, 8]: 1

### Transformation Rule:
- **Pattern Replication**: The non-zero elements should be repeated in a pattern across the entire grid.

### Applying the Rule:
- We will replicate the non-zero elements from the input grid across the entire output grid.

- In Example 4, all 3s are replaced by 5, and the rest are 0.
- In Example 5, the number 4 is replaced by 5, and the number 3 by 0.

From these examples, we can deduce that the rule is:

2013d3e2,"To solve the test case, we need to deduce the transformation rule from the provided training examples.

### Analysis of Training Examples:

#### Example 1:
- **Input:** 
  - The input is a 10x10 grid with a small pattern in the center.
- **Output:**
  - The output is a 3x3 grid that seems to capture the central part of the input pattern.

The central 3x3 pattern in the input is:
```
[7, 7, 0]
[6, 8, 8]
[7, 8, 4]
```
The output is:
```
[0, 0, 7]
[0, 6, 8]
[7, 8, 4]
```
This suggests that the output is a 3x3 grid centered around the central part of the input, but with the top-left corner shifted to the center of the original pattern.

#### Example 2:
- **Input:**
  - The input is another 10x10 grid with a different pattern in the center.
- **Output:**
  - The output is a 3x3 grid that captures the central part of the input pattern.

The central 3x3 pattern in the input is:
```
[3, 6, 5]
[5, 2, 2]
[6, 2, 2]
```
The output is:
```
[1, 0, 0]
[0, 3, 6]
[0, 5, 2]
```
This again suggests that the output is a 3x3 grid centered around the central part of the input, but with the top-left corner shifted to the center of the original pattern.

### General Transformation Rule:
The transformation rule appears to be:
1. Identify the central 3x3 pattern in the input grid.
2. Shift the top-left corner of the 3x3 pattern to the top-left corner of the output grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:

#### Central 3x3 Pattern:
The central 3x3 pattern in the input is:
```
[8, 3, 3]
[4, 3, 3]

#### Output:
Shifting the top-left corner of the 3x3 pattern to the top-left corner of the output grid, we get:

62c24649,"To determine the transformation rule, I'll analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

**Observations:**
1. **Grid Expansion:** Each output grid is twice the size of its corresponding input grid.
2. **Symmetry:** The output grids are symmetric both horizontally and vertically.
3. **Pattern Replication:** Each cell in the input grid is replicated in a symmetric pattern to form the output grid.

Let's break down the transformation rule:

- For each cell in the input grid, the value is mirrored both horizontally and vertically.
- Specifically, for an input grid of size \( n \times m \):
  - The output grid will be of size \( 2n \times 2m \).
  - Each cell at position \((i, j)\) in the input grid will appear at positions \((2i, 2j)\), \((2i, 2m - 1 - 2j)\), \((2n - 1 - 2i, 2j)\), and \((2n - 1 - 2i, 2m - 1 - 2j)\) in the output grid.
  - Additionally, the cells in between these positions are filled with the same value to maintain symmetry.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case:**
Input:
[
[1, 1, 0],
[0, 3, 2],
[3, 3, 0]
]

**Step-by-Step Transformation:**

1. **Expand the grid:**
   - The input grid is \( 3 \times 3 \), so the output grid will be \( 6 \times 6 \).

2. **Mirror the values:**
   - For each cell \((i, j)\) in the input grid, place the value at the mirrored positions in the output grid.

3. **Fill in the symmetric positions:**

   - Cell \((0, 0)\) = 1:
     - Positions: \((0, 0)\), \((0, 5)\), \((5, 0)\), \((5, 5)\)
   - Cell \((0, 1)\) = 1:
     - Positions: \((0, 1)\), \((0, 4)\), \((5, 1)\), \((5, 4)\)
   - Cell \((0, 2)\) = 0:
     - Positions: \((0, 2)\), \((0, 3)\), \((5, 2)\), \((5, 3)\)
   - Cell \((1, 0)\) = 0:
     - Positions: \((1, 0)\), \((1, 5)\), \((4, 0)\), \((4, 5)\)
   - Cell \((1, 1)\) = 3:
     - Positions: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 4)\), \((4, 1)\), \((4, 4)\)
   - Cell \((1, 2)\) = 2:
     - Positions: \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((4, 2)\), \((4, 3)\)
   - Cell \((2, 0)\) = 3:
     - Positions: \((2, 0)\), \((2, 5)\), \((3, 0)\), \((3, 5)\)
   - Cell \((2, 1)\) = 3:

1fad071e,"To understand the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

### Example Analysis:
1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** A 9x9 grid with various numbers.
   - **Output:** A 1x5 grid with the sequence `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - **Observation:** The output seems to be a row of 5 elements. The values `1` and `0` suggest a binary pattern.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Another 9x9 grid with various numbers.
   - **Output:** A 1x5 grid with the sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]`.
   - **Observation:** The output is again a row of 5 elements. The values are mostly `1` with a single `0`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** A 9x9 grid with various numbers.
   - **Output:** A 1x5 grid with the sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]`.
   - **Observation:** Similar to Example 2, the output is a row of 5 elements with mostly `1` and a single `0`.

### Pattern Recognition:
- In all examples, the output is a 1x5 grid.
- The output seems to be derived from the input grid, but the exact rule is not immediately clear.
- However, the presence of `1` and `0` suggests a binary representation based on some condition in the input grid.

### Hypothesis:
- The output might be a simplified representation of the input grid.
- One possible rule is that the output represents the presence or absence of certain patterns or features in the input grid.

### Testing the Hypothesis:
- Let's consider the presence of specific patterns (e.g., clusters of 1s or 2s) in the input grid.
- If we count the number of such clusters, we might get a binary sequence where `1` indicates the presence of a cluster and `0` indicates its absence.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Test Input:**
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0],
  [2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0],
  [2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ]
  ```

- **Analysis:**
  - The grid contains several clusters of `1`s and `2`s.
  - We can count the presence of these clusters:
    - Cluster of `1`s: Present (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
    - Cluster of `2`s: Present (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

- **Output:**
  - Since both clusters are present, the output should be a sequence of `1`s.
  - However, the examples show a single `0` in the sequence, which might indicate the end of the pattern or a specific condition.

### Final Answer:
- Based on the pattern observed, the output for the test case should be:
  ```
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  ```

a8c38be5,"To solve the test case, we need to understand the transformation rule applied in the training examples. Let's analyze the patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Boundary Detection**: In both examples, the output grids only contain the boundary cells of the shapes present in the input grids.
2. **Color Preservation**: The colors of the boundary cells are preserved in the output.
3. **Grid Size Reduction**: The output grids are smaller than the input grids, containing only the boundary cells.

### Steps to Determine the Transformation Rule:
1. **Identify Shapes**: Identify distinct shapes (connected regions of the same color) in the input grid.
2. **Extract Boundaries**: For each shape, extract its boundary cells.
3. **Form Output Grid**: Form the output grid using only the boundary cells, maintaining their relative positions.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
Let's apply the above steps to the test case:

#### Step 1: Identify Shapes
- Shape 1: 5s in various parts of the grid.
- Shape 2: 1s and 6s.
- Shape 3: 2s.
- Shape 4: 8s.
- Shape 5: 4s and 3s.
- Shape 6: 7s.

#### Step 2: Extract Boundaries
- For each shape, identify the boundary cells.
- Boundary cells are those that have at least one adjacent cell (up, down, left, right) with a different color.

#### Step 3: Form Output Grid
- Place the boundary cells in the output grid, maintaining their relative positions.

   - For each row that has a 5 in the last column, the 5s in that row are replaced by 2s, except for the last column which remains a 5.
   - Rows without a 5 in the last column remain unchanged.

### Applying the Transformation Rule to the Test Case:
- The test case has 5s in the last column in rows 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10.
- We will replace the 5s in these rows with 2s, except for the last column which remains a 5.

Let's apply this rule step by step:

1. **Row 3:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5] → [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
2. **Row 4:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5] → [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
3. **Row 6:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5] → [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
4. **Row 8:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5] → [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
5. **Row 10:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5] → [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]

For the first row:
- [5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0] → [2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]

The final transformed grid is:

### Analysis of Example 1:
- **Input**:
  - The first five rows are all zeros.
  - The last five rows have some non-zero values.
- **Output**:
  - The output is the same as the input but reversed row-wise.

### Analysis of Example 2:
- **Input**:
  - The first five rows are all zeros.
  - The last five rows have some non-zero values.
- **Output**:
  - The output is the same as the input but reversed row-wise.

### Conclusion:
The transformation rule appears to be that the input grid is reversed row-wise. This means the order of the rows in the grid is reversed, but the order of the elements within each row remains the same.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input**:
  - The first five rows are all zeros.
  - The last five rows have some non-zero values.

b7249182,"To solve this problem, we need to observe the pattern in the examples provided:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The number `2` appears at position (1, 4) and (10, 4).
   - In the output, a block of `2`s is formed around these positions, expanding vertically and horizontally.
   - Specifically, the block expands to form a cross shape with the original `2` at the center.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The numbers `3` and `1` appear at positions (6, 2) and (6, 12) respectively.
   - In the output, blocks of `3`s and `1`s are formed around these positions, forming a cross shape.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The numbers `5` and `8` appear at positions (6, 4) and (6, 17) respectively.
   - In the output, blocks of `5`s and `8`s are formed around these positions, forming a cross shape.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each non-zero number in the input grid, create a cross-shaped block of that number centered at the position of the number.
- The cross extends vertically and horizontally until it reaches the edge of the grid or another non-zero number.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case**:
- Non-zero numbers: `7` at (1, 3) and `6` at (17, 3).

**Transformation**:
1. For `7` at (1, 3):
   - Form a cross of `7`s centered at (1, 3).
   - The cross will extend vertically and horizontally until it reaches the edge of the grid.

2. For `6` at (17, 3):
   - Form a cross of `6`s centered at (17, 3).
   - The cross will extend vertically and horizontally until it reaches the edge of the grid.

- **Output:**
  - All the non-zero numbers are moved one step to the bottom-right direction.

0520fde7,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern or transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids. Let's analyze the provided examples:

### Example 1:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```

  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 2, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]]
  ```

### Example 2:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1],

  ```
- **Output:**

  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [
  [0, 0, 0],
  [2, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 2]]
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Pattern Observation:**
   - The number 5 in the input grid seems to be a key element.
   - The output grid is a smaller 3x3 grid.
   - The value 2 appears in the output grid where the corresponding positions in the input grid have a specific relationship with the number 5.

2. **Position Calculation:**
   - The position of the 5 in the input grid determines the position of the 2 in the output grid.
   - The 2 appears in the output grid at the position that corresponds to the relative position of the 5 in the input grid, but only if there are 1s surrounding the 5 in a specific pattern.

3. **Transformation Rule:**
   - The 2 appears in the output grid at the position that corresponds to the relative position of the 5 in the input grid, but only if the 5 is surrounded by 1s in a specific pattern (e.g., 1s directly above, below, left, or right of the 5).

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1],
  [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
  [1, 0, 1, 5, 0, 1, 0]]
  ```

- **Step-by-Step Transformation:**
  - The 5 is at position (0, 3), (1, 3), and (2, 3).
  - The 5 at (0, 3) has 1s at (0, 2) and (0, 4), so the output should have a 2 at (0, 1).
  - The 5 at (1, 3) has 1s at (1, 2) and (1, 4), so the output should have a 2 at (1, 1).
  - The 5 at (2, 3) has 1s at (2, 2) and (2, 4), so the output should have a 2 at (2, 1).

### Final Output:

47c1f68c,"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided examples:

### Example 1 Analysis:
- **Input:** A grid with a horizontal line of `2`s in the middle.
- **Output:** A smaller grid where the `2`s form a diamond shape.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input:** A grid with a horizontal line of `8`s in the middle.
- **Output:** A smaller grid where the `8`s form a diamond shape.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- **Input:** A grid with a horizontal line of `4`s in the middle.
- **Output:** A smaller grid where the `4`s form a diamond shape.

### General Transformation Rule:
- The transformation rule seems to take a grid with a horizontal line of a specific color (e.g., `2`, `8`, `4`) and transforms it into a smaller grid where that color forms a diamond shape.
- The diamond is centered around the middle row of the original grid.
- The size of the diamond is determined by the width of the horizontal line in the input grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input:** A grid with a horizontal line of `3`s in the middle.
- **Transformation:** The `3`s should form a diamond shape in the output grid.

Let's construct the output grid step by step:
1. Identify the horizontal line of `3`s in the input grid (row 7).
2. Create a smaller grid where the `3`s form a diamond shape centered around the middle of the input grid.

The input grid has 13 columns, so the output grid will have 11 columns (one less on each side).

### Constructing the Diamond:
- The top and bottom rows will have `3` at the center.
- The rows in between will have `3`s forming the diamond shape.

Here is the constructed output grid:

- **Output:**
  - Non-zero elements at positions: (4, 4-5), (5, 4-5), (9, 1), (9, 9)

The non-zero elements that were not part of the 2x2 block of 8s moved to the center of the 2x2 block.

### Example 2:
- **Input:**
  - Non-zero elements at positions: (1, 2), (1, 8), (5, 4-5), (6, 4-5), (7, 9), (8, 1)
- **Output:**
  - Non-zero elements at positions: (5, 4-5), (6, 4-5), (1, 2), (1, 8)

Again, the non-zero elements that were not part of the 2x2 block moved to the center of the 2x2 block.

### Example 3:
- **Input:**
  - Non-zero elements at positions: (0, 3), (0, 9), (2, 5-6), (3, 5-6), (6, 9), (7, 2)
- **Output:**
  - Non-zero elements at positions: (2, 5-6), (3, 5-6), (0, 3), (0, 9)

The pattern continues: non-zero elements outside the 2x2 block move to the center of the block.

### Test Case:
- **Input:**
  - Non-zero elements at positions: (1, 6), (3, 1), (4, 4-5), (5, 4-5), (8, 8), (9, 1), (9, 3)

Applying the transformation rule:
- The 2x2 block of 8s remains in place.
- The other non-zero elements move to the center of the 2x2 block (i.e., positions (4, 4) and (5, 4)).

d5d6de2d,"To determine the transformation rule from the input to the output, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - **Color 2** in the input seems to be the primary focus.
   - In the output, color **3** appears in positions where there are certain configurations of color **2** in the input.

2. **Configuration Analysis**:
   - In Example 1, the pattern of **2**s forms a small square and a larger square. The output shows that the center of the smaller square and the center of the larger square are filled with **3**s.
   - In Example 2, the pattern of **2**s forms a smaller square. The output shows that the center of this square is filled with **3**s.
   - In Example 3, the pattern of **2**s forms a larger square and two smaller squares. The output shows that the center of the larger square is filled with **3**s.

3. **Transformation Rule**:
   - The transformation rule appears to be: For any region of **2**s, if the region forms a square, the center of that square is replaced with **3** in the output.

4. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**:
   - The test case has two regions of **2**s:
     - A smaller 3x3 square at the top-left.
     - A larger 8x8 square in the middle-bottom.
   - The center of the 3x3 square is at position (1, 1) in the top-left 3x3 grid.
   - The center of the 8x8 square is at position (5, 5) in the 8x8 grid.

2. **Example 2**:

3. **Example 3**:
   - Similarly, the non-zero elements form a 3x3 grid, but it is positioned differently.
   - The output is this 3x3 grid.

### Pattern:
- The transformation rule appears to be extracting the smallest 3x3 grid that contains all non-zero elements from the input grid.

   - Observation: The same rule applies here. Non-zero elements that are not adjacent to any other non-zero element are set to 0.

3. **Example 3**:

5. **Row 5**: \[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\]
   - No non-zero elements.
   - Result: \[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\]

6. **Row 6**: \[1, 0, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0\]

   - 8 is adjacent to 6.
   - 6 is adjacent to 8.

88a62173,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

### Example 1:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [0, 2, 0, 0, 2],
  [2, 2, 0, 2, 2],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 2, 0, 2, 2],
  [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [
  [2, 2],
  [2, 0]]
  ```

The output is a 2x2 grid that seems to capture a specific pattern from the input. Notice that the output contains the values from the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input.

### Example 2:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [
  [1, 0],
  [1, 1]]
  ```

Again, the output is a 2x2 grid containing the values from the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input.

### Example 3:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [
  [8, 8, 0, 0, 8],
  [8, 0, 0, 8, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],
  [8, 0, 0, 8, 0]]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [
  [0, 8],
  [8, 0]]
  ```

This example also follows the same pattern. The output is a 2x2 grid containing the values from the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input.

### Conclusion:
The transformation rule is to extract the top-left 2x2 subgrid from the input grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Test Input:**
  ```
  [
  [5, 5, 0, 5, 0],
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 5],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
  [0, 5, 0, 0, 5]]
  ```

The top-left 2x2 subgrid is:
```
[
[5, 5],
[0, 5]]
```

Thus, the output for the test case is:
Answer: ``` [[5, 5], [0, 5]] ```","[[5 5]

8403a5d5,"To solve the puzzle, let's analyze the pattern observed in the transformation from the input to the output in the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: A single non-zero value `2` in the bottom row.
   - Output: The entire grid is filled with a repeating pattern of `2` and `0`, except for the columns where the original `2` was located and two adjacent columns which have `5`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: A single non-zero value `3` in the bottom row.
   - Output: Similar to Example 1, the entire grid is filled with a repeating pattern of `3` and `0`, except for the columns where the original `3` was located and two adjacent columns which have `5`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: A single non-zero value `4` in the bottom row.
   - Output: Similar to the previous examples, the entire grid is filled with a repeating pattern of `4` and `0`, except for the columns where the original `4` was located and two adjacent columns which have `5`.

From these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule:
- The grid is filled with alternating `x` and `0`, where `x` is the non-zero value in the input.
- The column containing the non-zero value and the two adjacent columns contain `5` instead of `x` in the positions where `x` would otherwise appear.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The non-zero value is `1` in the third column of the bottom row.
- The entire grid will be filled with alternating `1` and `0`.
- The third column and its two adjacent columns (second and fourth) will contain `5` in the positions where `1` would otherwise appear.

Let's construct the output grid based on this rule:

82819916,"To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule based on the provided examples. Let's analyze the changes:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input has rows with non-zero elements.
   - The output extends the non-zero elements in the row to the rightmost columns.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Similar to Example 1, the non-zero elements in the rows are extended to the rightmost columns.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The pattern is consistent with the previous examples. Non-zero elements in the rows are extended to the rightmost columns.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Again, the non-zero elements in the rows are extended to the rightmost columns.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each row with non-zero elements, extend these elements to fill the entire row to the rightmost columns.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Applying the rule:
- Row 1: `[2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]` remains unchanged.
- Row 4: `[8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` becomes `[8, 8, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 8]`.
- Row 7: `[1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` becomes `[1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1]`.
- Row 10: `[6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` becomes `[6, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6]`.
- Row 12: `[1, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` becomes `[1, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1, 6, 1]`.

The rest of the rows remain unchanged as they contain only zeros.

1. In both examples, the '5' values are consistently replaced by '1'.
2. In both examples, the '5' values at the bottom-right area are replaced by '2'.

Let's analyze more deeply:

- Example 1 and Example 2 show that all '5' values within the main diagonal or below are replaced by '1'.
- Any '5' values strictly above the main diagonal are replaced by '2'.

With this pattern in mind, let's apply the transformation to the test case:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The central 4x4 region of 2s is turned into a pattern where the inner square (not touching the border) has 1s.
   
2. **Example 2**:
   - The same transformation is applied, but the 2s form a more complex shape. The transformation still changes the inner cells (not touching the border of the 2s) to 1s.

3. **Example 3**:
   - This example has multiple regions of 2s. Each region is transformed independently by changing the inner cells (not touching the border of the region) to 1s.

The transformation rule can be summarized as:
- For any contiguous region of 2s, change all the cells that are not on the border of the region to 1s.

### Observations:
1. **Pattern of 2s and 4s:**
   - When there are two adjacent 2s horizontally or vertically, they are replaced by a sequence of 2s and 4s.
   - The 4 appears in the middle of the sequence.

2. **Propagation of 8s:**
   - The 8s remain unchanged in their original positions but can propagate vertically or horizontally to fill empty spaces if there are no obstacles.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
**Input:**

**Step-by-Step Transformation:**
1. **Identify the 2s and 4s:**
   - The two adjacent 2s in the fifth row will be replaced by a sequence of 2s and 4s.
   - The sequence will be [2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2].

2. **Propagate the 8s:**
   - The 8s in the first two rows will propagate vertically downward to fill the empty spaces in the third and fourth rows.

be94b721,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input has a large grid, and the output is a smaller grid with only the elements that form a connected component.
   - Specifically, the output includes the connected group of `2`s.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Similarly, the input has a larger grid, and the output is a smaller grid with only the connected group of `4`s.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input has a larger grid, and the output is a smaller grid with only the connected group of `8`s.

4. **Example 4**:
   - The input has a larger grid, and the output is a smaller grid with only the connected group of `2`s.

From these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- Extract the largest connected component of non-zero elements from the input grid.
- The connected component is defined such that any two non-zero elements are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

### Test Case Analysis:
- The input grid contains several connected components:
  - A group of `4`s in the top-left corner.
  - A group of `3`s in the middle.
  - A group of `6`s in the bottom-right corner.
  - A group of `5`s in the bottom-left corner.

- The largest connected component in terms of the number of elements is the group of `3`s in the middle.

### Extracting the Largest Connected Component:
- The group of `3`s is located at the following positions:
  - (2,3) to (4,5)

- The extracted grid is:
  ```
  [
  [3, 3, 3],
  [3, 3, 3],

4093f84a,"To solve the test case, let's first understand the transformation pattern based on the provided training examples:

### Observations:
1. **Pattern with Number 2 and 5:**
   - In Example 1, cells with the number `2` are replaced by `5` in the output if they are surrounded by `5`s in the input.
   - This suggests that the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with `5` under specific conditions.

2. **Pattern with Number 3 and 5:**
   - In Example 2, cells with the number `3` are replaced by `5` in the output if they are adjacent to `5`s in the input.
   - This suggests that the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with `5` if they are adjacent to `5`s.

3. **General Pattern:**
   - In all examples, the transformation seems to involve replacing non-`5` numbers with `5` if they are adjacent to `5`s.

### Steps to Apply the Transformation:
1. Identify all cells with a value other than `5`.
2. Check if these cells are adjacent to any cell with the value `5`.
3. If a cell is adjacent to a `5`, replace its value with `5`.

2204b7a8,"To solve the problem, let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided examples:

1. **Observation:** In all examples, cells that contain `3` in the input seem to change to the color of the nearest border (top or bottom) row or column.

2. **Transformation Rule:** For each cell with value `3`, replace it with the value of the nearest non-zero border (top, bottom, left, or right).

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

### Test Case Input:
```
[
[5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 4],
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],
[5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],

[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
]
```

### Applying the Transformation Rule:

- The top border is `5` and the bottom border is `4`.
- Replace each `3` with the nearest non-zero border value.

### Step-by-Step Replacement:

1. **First Row:**
   - Cell (0, 1): Nearest border is `5` (top).
   - New value: `5`.

2. **Second Row:**
   - Cell (1, 5): Nearest border is `4` (bottom).
   - Cell (1, 8): Nearest border is `4` (bottom).
   - New values: `[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4]`.

3. **Fourth Row:**
   - Cell (3, 3): Nearest border is `5` (top).
   - New value: `5`.

4. **Fifth Row:**
   - Cell (4, 6): Nearest border is `4` (bottom).
   - New value: `4`.

5. **Sixth Row:**
   - Cell (5, 3): Nearest border is `5` (top).
   - New value: `5`.

6. **Eighth Row:**
   - Cell (7, 4): Nearest border is `4` (bottom).
   - New value: `4`.

7. **Ninth Row:**
   - Cell (8, 2): Nearest border is `5` (top).
   - Cell (8, 6): Nearest border is `4` (bottom).
   - New values: `[5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4]`.

1. **Observation**: In both examples, the number `1` appears where there is an `8` that is adjacent to another `8` horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.
2. **Rule**: If an `8` has at least one neighboring `8` (up, down, left, or right), then that `8` is replaced with a `1`.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case:**

]
```

**Step-by-Step Transformation**:
1. **Row 1**: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8]` - Both `8`s are adjacent, so they become `1`.
   ```
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
   ```

2. **Row 2**: `[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]` - The first two `8`s are adjacent, so they become `1`. The last `8` is not adjacent to any other `8`, so it remains `8`.
   ```
   [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
   ```

3. **Row 3**: `[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` - The `8` is not adjacent to any other `8`, so it remains `8`.
   ```
   [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ```

4. **Row 4**: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]` - The `8` is not adjacent to any other `8`, so it remains `8`.
   ```
   [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
   ```

5. **Row 5**: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]` - Both `8`s are adjacent, so they become `1`.
   ```
   [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
   ```

6. **Row 6**: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` - The `8` is not adjacent to any other `8`, so it remains `8`.
   ```
   [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

7. **Row 7**: `[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` - Both `8`s are adjacent, so they become `1`.

3de23699,"To solve the puzzle, let's first identify the transformation rule based on the provided examples:

### Observations:
- **Example 1**: The input is a 7x7 grid with a central 3x3 block of non-zero values (4s and 2s). The output is a 3x3 grid that contains only the non-zero values from the central block.
- **Example 2**: The input is a 12x9 grid with a central 5x5 block of non-zero values (3s and 2s). The output is a 5x5 grid that contains only the non-zero values from the central block.
- **Example 3**: The input is a 12x14 grid with a central 4x4 block of non-zero values (6s and 8s). The output is a 4x4 grid that contains only the non-zero values from the central block.
- **Example 4**: The input is an 18x18 grid with a central 8x8 block of non-zero values (8s and 4s). The output is an 8x8 grid that contains only the non-zero values from the central block.

### General Rule:
- The transformation extracts a subgrid from the center of the input grid, where the subgrid contains all the non-zero values in the central region of the input grid.
- The size of the subgrid is determined by the smallest rectangle that can contain all the non-zero values in the central region.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- The input grid is a 19x19 grid with a central 11x11 block of non-zero values (2s and 3s).
- We need to extract the smallest subgrid that contains all the non-zero values in the central region.

Let's extract the central 11x11 block and then find the smallest subgrid containing all the non-zero values:

0d3d703e,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes from the input to the output in each example:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `[[3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2]]`
   - Output: `[[4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6]]`
   - Transformation: Each element is increased by 1.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `[[2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8]]`
   - Output: `[[6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9]]`
   - Transformation: Each element is increased by 4.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `[[5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6]]`
   - Output: `[[1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2]]`
   - Transformation: Each element is decreased by 4.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `[[9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2]]`
   - Output: `[[8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6]]`
   - Transformation: Each element is decreased by 1.

From these observations, we can see that the transformation rule is either adding or subtracting a constant value from each element in the grid. The constant value seems to vary between examples, but it is consistent within each example.

To find the correct transformation for the test case, we need to identify the pattern in the constant values used in the examples:
- Example 1: +1
- Example 2: +4
- Example 3: -4
- Example 4: -1

The pattern is not immediately clear, but we can try to apply the most common transformations to the test case and see which one fits the pattern best.

Let's try both adding and subtracting the most frequent constants (+1 and -1) to the test case:

**Test Case**:
- Input: `[[8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3]]`

1. **Adding 1**:
   - Output: `[[9, 2, 4], [9, 2, 4], [9, 2, 4]]`

2. **Subtracting 1**:
   - Output: `[[7, 0, 2], [7, 0, 2], [7, 0, 2]]`

Given the examples, the most likely transformation is adding 1, as it appears more frequently in the examples.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

a9f96cdd,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the training examples:

- In all examples, the number `2` in the input grid is the key that triggers the transformation.
- After the transformation, the position of `2` is replaced with `3`.
- Additionally, two other numbers appear in the grid: `6`, `7`, and `8`. These numbers seem to follow a specific pattern based on the position of `2`.

Let's break down the pattern:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `2` is at (1, 1).
   - Output: `3` is at (0, 0), `6` is at (0, 2), `8` is at (2, 0), and `7` is at (2, 2).

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `2` is at (2, 3).
   - Output: `3` is at (1, 3), `6` is at (0, 4), `8` is at (2, 0), and `7` is at (2, 2).

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `2` is at (0, 2).
   - Output: `3` is not present, but `8` is at (1, 1) and `7` is at (1, 2).

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `2` is at (1, 3).
   - Output: `3` is at (0, 2), `6` is at (0, 4), `8` is at (2, 0), and `7` is at (2, 2).

From these observations, we can deduce the following rules:
- The `2` is always replaced by `3`.
- The `3` is placed in the position one row up and one column left from the original `2`.
- The `6` is placed one row up and one column right from the original `2`.
- The `8` is placed in the bottom-left corner of the grid.
- The `7` is placed in the bottom-right corner of the grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

- Input: `2` is at (1, 3).
- Output:
  - `3` should be at (0, 2).
  - `6` should be at (0, 4).
  - `8` should be at (2, 0).
  - `7` should be at (2, 4).

     [5, 5, 3, 3, 5, 8]
     [8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 8]
     ```
   - **Observations**:
     - The output grid is a larger version of the input grid.
     - The output seems to be formed by repeating the input grid in a specific pattern.

2. **Example 2**:
   - **Input**:
     ```
     [3, 8, 2]
     [3, 2, 2]
     [8, 5, 2]
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     [3, 8, 2, 8, 3, 3]
     [3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 8]
     [8, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2]
     [2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 8]
     [8, 2, 5, 2, 2, 3]
     [3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 3]
     ```
   - **Observations**:
     - Similar to Example 1, the output grid is a larger version of the input grid.
     - The pattern of repetition is consistent with Example 1.

3. **Example 3**:
   - **Input**:
     ```
     [0, 3, 0]
     [6, 6, 6]
     [0, 3, 0]
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     [0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0]
     [6, 6, 6, 3, 6, 3]
     [0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0]
     [0, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0]
     [3, 6, 3, 6, 6, 6]
     [0, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0]
     ```
   - **Observations**:
     - Again, the output grid is a larger version of the input grid.
     - The pattern of repetition is consistent with the previous examples.

### Transformation Rule:
- The output grid is formed by repeating the input grid in a 2x2 block pattern.
- Each row of the output grid is formed by concatenating two rows of the input grid, and the entire grid is repeated vertically.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input**:
  ```
  [2, 5, 0]
  [2, 5, 1]
  [3, 1, 1]
  ```

- **Step-by-Step Transformation**:
  - Repeat the input grid horizontally and vertically to form the output grid.

- **Output**:
  ```
  [2, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2]
  [2, 5, 1, 1, 5, 5]
  [3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Once more, the non-zero values are mirrored horizontally.

### Test Case:
Given the pattern observed, we need to mirror the non-zero values horizontally in the test case.

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

After examining the transformations:

1. Non-zero numbers move diagonally towards the bottom right corner.
2. If a number moves off the edge of the grid, it disappears.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

56ff96f3,"To understand the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: Single 1s and 2s scattered in different rows.
   - Output: Each number (1 or 2) expands horizontally to fill all the columns between the leftmost and rightmost occurrence of that number in its row.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: Similar to Example 1, but with numbers 3 and 7.
   - Output: Each number (3 or 7) expands horizontally to fill all the columns between the leftmost and rightmost occurrence of that number in its row.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: Single 4s in different rows.
   - Output: Each number 4 expands horizontally to fill all the columns between the leftmost and rightmost occurrence of 4 in its row.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: Single 7s in different rows.
   - Output: Each number 7 expands horizontally to fill all the columns between the leftmost and rightmost occurrence of 7 in its row.

From these examples, we can deduce the transformation rule:
- For each row, if there are any non-zero numbers, they should expand horizontally to fill all the columns between the leftmost and rightmost occurrence of that number in the row.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case**:
```

[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

**Transformation**:
1. Row 1: 8 expands to fill columns 1 to 8.
2. Row 2: 8 expands to fill columns 3 to 8.
3. Row 5: 6 expands to fill columns 6 to 8.
4. Row 8: 6 expands to fill columns 2 to 8.

Applying this transformation, we get:

c9f8e694,"To determine the transformation rule, I will analyze the changes in the example grids from input to output.

### Analysis:

1. **Color Replacement**:
   - In both examples, the color `5` is replaced with the value of the non-zero element in the adjacent row or column.
   - For instance, in Example 1, the `5`s in the first row are replaced by `1` because the non-zero value in that row is `1`.
   - Similarly, in Example 2, the `5`s are replaced by the non-zero value in their respective rows or columns.

2. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The replacement happens only for the `5`s, and they are replaced by the nearest non-zero value in the same row or column.
   - If a `5` is surrounded by zeros, it remains a `5`.

### Applying the Transformation Rule to the Test Case:

Let's apply the same logic to the test case:

            for val in row:
                if val != 0 and val != 5:
                    new_row.append(val)
                    break
            else:

f8a8fe49,"To identify the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: A grid with a horizontal line of `2`s and a block of `5`s.
   - Output: The same grid, but the block of `5`s has been moved to a different position.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: A grid with a horizontal line of `2`s and a smaller block of `5`s.
   - Output: The same grid, but the block of `5`s has been expanded and moved.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: A grid with a horizontal line of `2`s and a larger block of `5`s.
   - Output: The same grid, but the block of `5`s has been expanded and moved.

From these examples, we can infer that the transformation rule involves moving and possibly expanding blocks of `5`s while keeping other elements fixed.

### Transformation Rule:
- **Move the block of `5`s**: The block of `5`s is moved to a new position in the grid.
- **Expand the block of `5`s**: The block of `5`s may be expanded to cover more cells.

- **Output**:
  - Move the block of `5`s to a new position, potentially expanding it.
  - Based on the pattern observed, the block of `5`s should be moved to the left and up, and possibly expanded.

Given the pattern, let's move the block of `5`s to the left and up, and expand it slightly:

8e5a5113,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes in the provided examples:

1. In all examples, the zeros (0s) in the input grid are replaced with values.
2. The replacement values come from the surrounding non-zero numbers in the input grid.

Let's break down the transformation rule more specifically:

- For each zero (0) in the input grid, we look at the neighboring cells (top, bottom, left, right).
- We replace the zero with the value of the nearest non-zero neighbor in a clockwise direction (top, right, bottom, left).

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
[
[3, 3, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[9, 9, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[2, 9, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
]

Step-by-step transformation:

1. Replace the zeros in the first row:
   - 0 at [0, 4] -> 9 (from the left)
   - 0 at [0, 5] -> 9 (from the left)
   - 0 at [0, 6] -> 9 (from the left)
   - 0 at [0, 8] -> 5 (from the right)
   - 0 at [0, 9] -> 5 (from the right)
   - 0 at [0, 10] -> 5 (from the right)

2. Replace the zeros in the second row:
   - 0 at [1, 4] -> 9 (from the left)
   - 0 at [1, 5] -> 9 (from the left)
   - 0 at [1, 6] -> 9 (from the left)
   - 0 at [1, 8] -> 5 (from the right)
   - 0 at [1, 9] -> 5 (from the right)
   - 0 at [1, 10] -> 5 (from the right)

3. Replace the zeros in the third row:
   - 0 at [2, 4] -> 9 (from the left)
   - 0 at [2, 5] -> 9 (from the left)
   - 0 at [2, 6] -> 9 (from the left)
   - 0 at [2, 8] -> 5 (from the right)
   - 0 at [2, 9] -> 5 (from the right)
   - 0 at [2, 10] -> 5 (from the right)

74dd1130,"To solve the puzzle, let's first analyze the transformation rules based on the provided examples.

### Observing the Patterns:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** 
     ```
     [2, 2, 1]
     [1, 5, 1]
     [5, 2, 2]
     ```
   - **Output:**
     ```
     [2, 1, 5]
     [2, 5, 2]
     [1, 1, 2]
     ```
   - **Transformation:**
     - The first row remains mostly unchanged except that the `1` moves to the second position.
     - The second row swaps the positions of `5` and `1`.
     - The third row swaps the positions of the two `1`s and keeps the `2` in place.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:**
     ```
     [2, 2, 5]
     [6, 2, 2]
     [5, 5, 5]
     ```
   - **Output:**
     ```
     [2, 6, 5]
     [2, 2, 5]
     [5, 2, 5]
     ```
   - **Transformation:**
     - The first row replaces the `2` with `6`.
     - The second row remains mostly unchanged except the `5` moves to the last position.
     - The third row replaces one of the `5`s with `2`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:**
     ```
     [9, 9, 5]
     [5, 5, 8]
     [5, 8, 9]
     ```
   - **Output:**
     ```
     [9, 5, 5]
     [9, 5, 8]
     [5, 8, 9]
     ```
   - **Transformation:**
     - The first row swaps the positions of the `5`s.
     - The second row swaps the positions of the `5` and `9`.
     - The third row remains unchanged.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:**
     ```
     [2, 6, 6]
     [2, 1, 1]
     [2, 6, 2]
     ```
   - **Output:**
     ```
     [2, 2, 2]
     [6, 1, 6]
     [6, 1, 2]
     ```
   - **Transformation:**
     - The first row replaces the `6`s with `2`s.
     - The second row swaps the positions of the `1`s and `6`.
     - The third row swaps the positions of the `6` and `2`.

### Generalizing the Rule:
- The transformation appears to involve swapping or repositioning elements within each row.
- Specifically, it seems that the first element of each row is kept fixed, and the remaining elements are rearranged such that the smallest number among the non-first elements is moved to the second position, and the rest are shifted accordingly.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [9, 3, 4]
  [9, 4, 4]
  [9, 3, 4]
  ```

- **Transformation:**
  - For the first row `[9, 3, 4]`, the smallest number among the non-first elements is `3`. So, the row becomes `[9, 3, 4]`.
  - For the second row `[9, 4, 4]`, the smallest number among the non-first elements is `4`. So, the row becomes `[9, 4, 4]`.
  - For the third row `[9, 3, 4]`, the smallest number among the non-first elements is `3`. So, the row becomes `[9, 3, 4]`.

Thus, the output for the test case is:
```
[9, 3, 4]
[9, 4, 4]
[9, 3, 4]

- In Example 1, the input is a 2x6 grid with the first row containing all 3s and the second row containing all 9s. The output is also a 2x6 grid but alternates between 3 and 9 in each row.
- In Example 2, the input is a 2x6 grid with the first row containing all 4s and the second row containing all 8s. The output is also a 2x6 grid but alternates between 4 and 8 in each row.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:

Applying this rule to the test case:

ddf7fa4f,"To solve the test case, I need to understand the transformation rule applied in the examples provided:

1. **Identify the pattern**: 
   - In all examples, non-zero values that form a rectangle or square block are replaced by the value at the top-left corner of the block.
   - The replacement happens only within the block and not outside it.

2. **Apply the pattern to the test case**:
   - Identify the blocks of non-zero values in the test case.
   - Replace the values within each block with the value at the top-left corner of the block.

Let's break down the test case:

- The first row has a 3 at the start and a 6 in the middle, and a 9 towards the end.
- There is a large block of 5s starting from the third row, third column to the sixth row, tenth column.
- There is a smaller block of 5s in the seventh row, ninth and tenth columns.
- There is another block of 5s in the eighth and ninth rows, first to fourth columns.

Now, let's apply the transformation:

- The 3 in the first row remains unchanged.
- The 6 in the first row remains unchanged.
- The 9 in the first row remains unchanged.
- The large block of 5s will be replaced by 5s (since 5 is already the value at the top-left corner).
- The smaller block of 5s in the seventh row will be replaced by 5s.
- The block of 5s in the eighth and ninth rows will be replaced by 5s.

   - Expand the 7s to all adjacent cells (including diagonals) that are 0.
   - This affects rows 7 and 8.

2. **Color 4 Region Expansion**:
   - Expand the 4s to all adjacent cells (including diagonals) that are 0.

b91ae062,"To identify the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: A 3x3 grid with values: [[6, 7, 0], [0, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0]]
   - Output: A 6x6 grid where each value in the input is repeated twice horizontally and vertically.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: A 3x3 grid with values: [[1, 0, 4], [0, 4, 0], [0, 1, 0]]
   - Output: A 6x6 grid where each value in the input is repeated twice horizontally and vertically.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: A 3x3 grid with values: [[3, 2, 0], [0, 7, 3], [0, 0, 0]]
   - Output: A 9x9 grid where each value in the input is repeated three times horizontally and vertically.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: A 3x3 grid with values: [[0, 8, 0], [0, 6, 6], [9, 8, 0]]
   - Output: A 9x9 grid where each value in the input is repeated three times horizontally and vertically.

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: A 3x3 grid with values: [[4, 0, 3], [2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 8]]
   - Output: A 12x12 grid where each value in the input is repeated four times horizontally and vertically.

From these examples, we can deduce that the transformation rule is:
- Each element in the input grid is repeated `n` times both horizontally and vertically, where `n` is the size of the input grid (in this case, 3).

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Case**:
- Input: A 3x3 grid with values: [[0, 1, 0], [0, 8, 7], [9, 9, 0]]

We need to repeat each element 3 times both horizontally and vertically.

Let's construct the output grid step by step:

1. Repeat each row 3 times.
2. For each repeated row, repeat each element 3 times horizontally.

```python
input_grid = [
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 8, 7],
    [9, 9, 0]
]

output_grid = []
for row in input_grid:
    expanded_row = []
    for val in row:
        expanded_row.extend([val] * 3)
    for _ in range(3):
        output_grid.append(expanded_row)

print(output_grid)
```

The resulting output grid is:
