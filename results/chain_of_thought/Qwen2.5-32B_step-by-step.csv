75b8110e,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the given input grids, I'll analyze the changes from input to output in the training examples.

1. The output grid is smaller than the input grid. Specifically, the output grid is half the size of the input grid in both width and height.
2. It appears that the transformation involves selecting specific values from the input grid, often along diagonals or by grouping certain cells, rather than simply cropping or resizing the input.

Let's observe patterns in the first training example:
- **Input**:
```python
[
[4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0],
[4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0],
[0, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0],
[6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9],
[6, 0, 6, 6, 9, 9, 0, 0],
[0, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]]
```
- **Output**:
```python
[
[4, 4, 5, 0],
[6, 6, 6, 9],
[6, 9, 5, 6],
[5, 5, 6, 0]]
```

By comparing input and output, it seems the output consists of specific values selected from different parts of the input grid, possibly following a pattern related to grouping or diagonal selections.

Analyzing further examples similarly, we can see that the pattern involves taking values from specific areas of the input grid and placing them into the output grid. This process seems to involve picking key values and arranging them in a particular order.

Let's apply this understanding to the test case:

- **Test Input**:
```python
[
[0, 4, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5],
[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[6, 0, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0],
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9],
[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]]
```

Following the observed pattern, the test output should be:
```python
[
[4, 5, 5, 5],
[6, 9, 5, 0],
[6, 5, 9, 6],
[5, 9, 0, 6]]
```

Thus, the solution is:
Answer: ``` [[4, 5, 5, 5], [6, 9, 5, 0], [6, 5, 9, 6], [5, 9, 0, 6]] ```","[[4 5 5 5]

 [5 9 0 6]]",True,True,0.38
3618c87e,"In analyzing the training examples, we find that the transformation rule involves replacing elements with specific patterns:

1. Elements of value `1` within a row of otherwise `0`s are replaced with `0`s.
2. If there's a pair of `1` values on either side of a `5`, the middle `5` remains unchanged, but the `1`s are swapped with `5`s at the edges.

Let's apply these rules to the test case:

Input Test Case:
```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 5, 0, 5],
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
]
```

- The first two rows are all `0`s, so they remain unchanged.
- In the third row, we see `1`s surrounded by `0`s. These `1`s get replaced with `0`s.
- The fourth row has `5`s on the outer sides and `0` in the middle. Since there are no `1`s to swap with `5`s, it remains as is.
- The fifth row consists of all `5`s and does not require any change.

Thus, following the transformation rule derived from our analysis, the output should look like this:

Output Test Case:

3ac3eb23,"To find the transformation rule that was applied in the training examples, let's analyze the changes from input to output:

In Example 1:
- The first row has numbers at the second and sixth positions.
- These numbers (2 and 8) appear in subsequent rows but shifted. Specifically, 2 appears in the even rows in the first position, third position, etc., and 8 appears in the even rows at the fifth and seventh positions, etc.

In Example 2:
- There is only one non-zero value in the first row, which is 4.
- This number, 4, repeats in the subsequent rows but alternates its position (first row, first position; second row, second position, etc.).

Based on the patterns observed in the training examples, the transformation rule seems to be as follows:
- Any non-zero number in the first row is mirrored across the subsequent rows with alternating positions.
- If there is an even number of rows, the pattern continues up to the last row.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
```[
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]```

Output: 
1. The number 3 is in the third position; it should mirror every other row starting here.
2. The number 6 is in the seventh position; it should mirror every other row starting here.
3. The number 7 is in the tenth position; it should mirror every other row starting here.

Following this rule, the output would be:
```[

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the transformation rule involves rotating the outer ""ring"" of the grid 90 degrees clockwise while keeping the central value unchanged if it's a single central value or the center square if it's larger.

Let's apply this transformation to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```plaintext
6 4 4
6 6 4
4 6 7
```

Rotating the outer ring 90 degrees clockwise:
- The top row becomes the right column.
- The right column (excluding the top right corner) becomes the bottom row.
- The bottom row becomes the left column.
- The left column (excluding the top left corner) becomes the top row.

So, after rotation:

ba97ae07,"To understand the transformation rule, we need to observe the pattern in the transformation from each example's input to its output.

In all provided examples, there is a common feature that certain rows or columns containing a specific color (i.e., integers other than 0) are being replaced with a solid strip of that color across their entire row or column. However, if a row or a column contains multiple colors, the transformation only applies to the smallest bounding region of that color, leaving the rest of the row/column unchanged.

Let's analyze each training example:

1. In Example 1, the '3' rows are transformed into solid rows of '3', except for the columns where '8' appears.

2. In Example 2, the '1' row intersects with '6' columns. The '1's at the intersection points with '6' columns are replaced with '6'.

3. In Example 3, the '7' row intersects with '1' columns. The '7' at the intersection points with '1' columns are replaced with '1'.

4. In Example 4, the '2' row intersects with '3' columns. The '2' at the intersection points with '3' columns are replaced with '3', but the overall effect is that the row becomes solid with the color '2'.

For the test case:

The pattern here involves the number 4 being present in most of the rows and columns, and numbers 0 and 5 appearing alongside. Based on the previous examples, we can predict the transformation rules:

- The rows containing '5' should transform the '4' columns into '5'.
- Since the '4's form a central block, they will not be replaced by anything else outside of their region.
- All rows that contain '4' will be replaced with '4' except for the intersections with '5'.

Applying these rules to the test case:

1. The rows with '5' should have '5's wherever they intersect with '4's.
2. All '4's will remain in place within their own block, forming a solid region.
3. Rows with only '0's will remain unchanged.

Thus, the output should be:

```python

846bdb03,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the grids, we'll analyze the patterns in the provided training examples.

Observations:
1. The transformation seems to focus on reducing the dimensions of the grid while preserving certain patterns.
2. The corners and edges of the larger grid are often condensed into smaller grid structures.
3. The colors (integers) at the edges or corners of the large grid tend to appear in the corners of the smaller grid after transformation.
4. The transformation does not seem to involve any complex algorithm but rather a simplification approach, possibly involving removing rows and columns from the center that don't contribute to the overall pattern.

To transform the test case, let's follow these observations. For the test case:

- The input grid has significant elements around the corners and edges: `4`, `2`, `8`.
- It has symmetrical patterns with zeros filling much of the central area.

Let's apply the reduction process keeping significant color elements (`4`, `2`, `8`) in the corners and maintaining the symmetry.

```python
# Applying the observed pattern:
# - The outermost non-zero values in the original grid shape would form the corners/edges of the reduced grid.
# - Patterns of numbers would be retained where applicable.

# The resulting grid based on the pattern is constructed as follows:
# - First and last rows/columns have `4` and `8` at the corners.
# - Middle rows maintain `2` and `8` pattern symmetrically.

Answer: [[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],

10fcaaa3,"To find the transformation rule applied to the inputs to produce the outputs, let's analyze the given examples:

1. The width of the grid doubles.
2. The height of the grid also increases, but not in a straightforward doubling pattern. Instead, new rows appear to be inserted between existing ones.
3. For the numbers that are present (not zeros), they're mirrored or repeated in a specific pattern.
4. The number 8 seems to act as a filler or separator, appearing frequently in the transformed grids, often surrounding or separating the original numbers.

By examining these patterns, the transformation can be broken down as follows:

- For every row, repeat its pattern horizontally, with an alternating sequence of numbers and zeros.
- Insert rows filled entirely with 8s.
- For numbers other than zero, replicate their presence in a mirrored fashion with 8s acting as separators or fillers.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Test Case: 
```[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]]```

Following the transformation rules:

1. Each row width expands, and 8s are added as separators.
2. New rows filled with 8s are inserted between original rows.

1. A pattern of `2`s is added to create a background grid.
2. The original non-zero values (`5` in these examples) are preserved at their original positions.

Let's break down the transformations further:

- The first two examples show a pattern where `2`s are placed in a specific grid-like manner, covering much of the area but leaving gaps or avoiding the edges in a systematic way.
- The `5`s and `0`s at their original positions remain unchanged.

67a423a3,"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze how the given input grids are transformed into their respective output grids. We observe that the transformation involves replacing certain values in specific patterns.

In Example 1:
- Values `0` and `3` seem to be replaced with `4` in a specific pattern.
- The central portion surrounded by `2`s gets filled with `4`s, except the `2`s themselves which remain unchanged.
- The bottom row remains unchanged.

In Example 2:
- The central part, surrounded by `0`s and `6`s, is getting filled with `4`s around the `6`s.
- The top and bottom parts remain unchanged.
- The `8`s and the `6`s stay where they are, but the `0`s around them are replaced with `4`s.

In Example 3:
- The central column of `1`s remains intact.
- Surrounding areas get filled with `4`s around the `1`s and `9`s.

From these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule seems to involve replacing `0`s with `4`s or another color, depending on their position relative to other numbers in the grid, while keeping the original numbers (`2`s, `6`s, `9`s, etc.) intact.

Applying the transformation rule to the test case:
- The central column of `5`s should be surrounded by `4`s.
- The `3`s in the middle row will remain as they are.

In the first example, all numbers in the output grid are 4, which seems to be the most frequently appearing number in the input grid.
- Input: 
  [
  [4, 4, 8],
  [6, 4, 3],
  [6, 3, 0]]
- Output: 
  [
  [4, 4, 4],
  [4, 4, 4],
  [4, 4, 4]]

In the second example, all numbers in the output grid are 9, which also appears to be the most frequent number in the input grid.
- Input: 
  [
  [6, 8, 9],
  [1, 8, 1],
  [9, 4, 9]]
- Output: 
  [
  [9, 9, 9],
  [9, 9, 9],
  [9, 9, 9]]

In the third example, the output grid consists entirely of 6s, which again is the most frequent number in the input grid.
- Input: 
  [
  [4, 6, 9],
  [6, 4, 1],
  [8, 8, 6]]
- Output: 
  [
  [6, 6, 6],
  [6, 6, 6],
  [6, 6, 6]]

From these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule is to replace every number in the output grid with the most frequently occurring number in the input grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
- Test Input: 
  [
  [8, 8, 6],
  [4, 6, 9],
  [8, 3, 0]]

We count the frequency of each number:
- 8 occurs 3 times
- 6 occurs 2 times
- 4 occurs 1 time
- 9 occurs 1 time
- 3 occurs 1 time
- 0 occurs 1 time

The most frequent number is 8, so we fill the entire output grid with 8s.

Thus, the solution for the test case is:

234bbc79,"Let's break down the transformation rule from the input grids to the output grids in the training examples provided:

1. The transformation seems to reduce the number of columns in the output grid compared to the input grid.
2. There is a reduction in the number of rows in some cases, but not all. So, the row count stays the same or decreases slightly depending on patterns.
3. Values within the output grid seem to be derived from adjacent cells in the input grid, where colors appear to be simplified or merged.

Analyzing the transformation further, we see that:

- Each output cell is a result of a specific pattern recognition involving adjacent cells in the input grid.
- Specifically, it appears that if a sequence of the same color appears in a certain pattern across multiple input cells, they are replaced with a single value in the output grid.
- In the input, certain numbers are condensed into fewer distinct numbers in the output, possibly merging similar patterns into one representation.

Given these observations, let's apply this rule to our test case:

Test input:
``` 
[
[0, 5, 0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 8],
[2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 3, 0, 0, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

We can infer that the transformation involves pattern recognition and simplification. Considering the patterns:

- `0` and `5` in the first row form alternating patterns which could be simplified to `0`.
- `2` and `2` at the start of the second row simplify to `2`.
- `1`, `0`, `5`, `3`, `0`, `0`, `8` in the second row get simplified into fewer distinct values.

Based on the training examples, the test output might look like:

- First row of output likely simplifies `0`, `5`, `0`, `5` to `0`.
- Second row simplifies `2`, `2` to `2`, and remaining elements might simplify based on their grouping.
- Third row has all `0`s so it remains `0`.

Putting it together, the test case output would be:

[0, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0],

08ed6ac7,"To solve the test case, let's analyze what happens in the transformation from the input to the output in the training examples.

In both examples provided, there's a pattern where the color `5` in the input gets transformed into different numerical values (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`) in the output. Each unique position of `5` in a column seems to get a new color value starting with 1, moving upwards in columns, and then continuing with the next column if applicable.

For Example 1, the `5`s form a vertical and horizontal pattern. When transformed, the first column of `5`s turns into `1`s, the second column into `2`s, and so on. The same logic applies to both examples.

Considering this transformation rule, we will apply it to the test case. We need to go through each column, and when we encounter a `5`, we incrementally assign new values starting from `1`.

bbc9ae5d,"From the provided training examples, we observe that the transformation rule applied to the inputs can be described as follows:

1. Each input grid is a single row of numbers.
2. The output grids are expanded into multiple rows, where the expansion begins from the left side of the row.
3. The number of rows in the output grid is equal to the number of non-zero elements in the first row of the input grid.
4. In the output grid, for each row, the non-zero elements from the left side of the input grid are propagated downwards and to the right until the zero boundary is reached.

Let's look at Example 1: 
- Input: `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. There are 2 non-zero elements.
- Output: A 3-row grid with `1`s expanding to the right until the zeros are reached.

The same logic applies to other examples. For instance:
- Example 2 has 1 leading non-zero element, resulting in a 4-row output.
- Example 3 has 3 leading non-zero elements, resulting in a 5-row output.
- And so forth.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to our test case:
- Test Input: `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- This input has 3 non-zero leading elements.
- Therefore, the output grid should have 4 rows.

f5b8619d,"To transform the input grid into the output grid, we can observe the following rules from the provided examples:

1. The size of the output grid is doubled in both dimensions compared to the input grid.
2. The value `8` acts as a background color that fills the gaps where there are no input values.
3. Input values are repeated in a mirrored pattern across the output grid.

Let's break this down further with the test case:

- The input grid is a 4x4 grid.
- The output grid will thus be an 8x8 grid.

We can see that the pattern involves mirroring the input grid along the vertical and horizontal axis. The position of non-zero values is duplicated and the rest is filled with 8s.

Now, let's apply these observations to our test case:

```[
[0, 0, 3, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0],

In the first example transformation:
- The middle 5x5 square with `5`s gets transformed into a pattern of `1`, `2`, and `4`.
- The pattern appears to be based on the position within the block of `5`s, where corners are `1`, edges are `4`, and centers are `2`.

In the second example transformation:
- A similar pattern is applied but only to the blocks of `5`s on the left and right sides of the grid.

The rule seems to be that any contiguous block of `5`s in the input becomes a specific pattern of `1`, `2`, and `4` in the output, with:
- Corners of the block becoming `1`
- Edges not part of the corners becoming `4`
- Centers of the block becoming `2`

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

The top-left 6x5 block of `5`s should transform into:
- Corners: `1`
- Edges: `4`
- Center: `2`

Upon analysis, several patterns can be observed, but the most prominent one seems to be a substitution of zeros with specific numbers based on their position and surrounding numbers.

1. Zeros at the edges or corners of the grid tend to get substituted with higher numbers (e.g., 2 or 3), likely due to their isolated nature.
2. Zeros surrounded by fives (5s) often get substituted with lower numbers (usually 1).

[3, 4, 6]
[3, 4, 6]
[3, 4, 6]
```
Output:
```
[3, 4, 6]
```
- All rows are identical so they collapse into one row [3, 4, 6].

**Example 3**
Input:
```
[2, 3, 3, 8, 1]
[2, 3, 3, 8, 1]
[2, 3, 3, 8, 1]
```
Output:
```
[2, 3, 8, 1]
```
- Rows collapse into one, reducing [2, 3, 3, 8, 1] to [2, 3, 8, 1].

**Example 4**
Input:
```
[2, 2]
[6, 6]
[8, 8]
[8, 8]
```
Output:
```
[2]
[6]
[8]
```
- Each row reduces to its unique value.

**Example 5**
Input:
```
[4, 4, 4, 4]
[4, 4, 4, 4]
[2, 2, 2, 2]
[2, 2, 2, 2]
[8, 8, 8, 8]
[3, 3, 3, 3]
```
Output:
```
[4]
[2]
[8]
[3]
```
- Each block of identical rows collapses and reduces to a single unique value.

Let's now apply this to our test case:

**Test Case**
Input:
```
[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4]
[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4]
[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4]
[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 4]
```

Step-by-step transformation:
1. Collapse identical rows.
2. Reduce consecutive duplicates within each row.

This results in:
```
[1, 2, 3, 8, 4]
```

Therefore, the output should be:

025d127b,"Upon analyzing the transformations made in the provided training examples, I observe that the patterns within the grids shift to the right by one column, except for the first column which remains as a buffer of zeros.

Let's break down the transformation applied to Example 1:

Input:
```
[
...
[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0],
...
]
```

Output:
```
[

[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0],
...

```

The same logic applies to Example 2 where the pattern shifts to the right by one column, creating a zero buffer on the left.

Applying this rule to the Test case:

Input:
```
[
...
[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
...
]
```

We shift all non-zero columns one position to the right and add a zero in the first column to maintain the width of the grid.

54d82841,"To determine the transformation applied in the examples, let's examine the changes between inputs and outputs:

1. In all cases, the parts of the grid that contain values other than zero remain unchanged.
2. The transformation appears to introduce 4s in specific locations. Observing closely, it seems 4s are placed on the diagonals (both main and anti-diagonal) starting from the bottom of the grid up to where the non-zero pattern ends.

From the observation above, we can derive the following rule:
1. Keep all non-zero elements as they are.
2. Starting from the bottom row and moving upwards, place 4s on the diagonal positions (main and anti-diagonal) until a non-zero element (other than 4) is encountered in either direction.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:

Transforming according to the rule:
- No changes to elements with values 5, 8, or 3.
- Place 4s along the diagonal positions until encountering a non-zero value (other than 4).

In Example 1:
Input grid has numbers 4 and 5. The output grid shows that all occurrences of number 5 have been replaced by 0, except for the central elements which remain as 4.

In Example 2:
The input grid contains numbers 5 and 6. The output grid indicates that the number 5 is replaced with 0, while the number 6 remains unchanged. Similar to Example 1, the central element in the grid remains as is.

In Example 3:
Numbers 9 and 5 are involved in this input grid. Based on the output grid, it can be determined that number 5 is transformed to 0, and the number 9 remains unchanged unless surrounded by 5s or positioned in such a pattern where transformation rules apply.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves replacing one specific number (which is not the majority or central color in the grid) with 0, while keeping the other numbers mostly intact except under certain patterns.

Applying this rule to the Test case, we observe the following:

- The numbers 3 and 5 are present.
- Based on previous examples, number 3 appears to be the primary color and number 5 the one being transformed.

Therefore, we replace all instances of 5 with 0, leaving 3s mostly unchanged. 

Thus, the transformation of the test case grid would look like this:

1. **Pattern Observation:** In each example, the first column remains unchanged while the rest of the grid is modified.
2. **Incremental Pattern:** Moving from left to right and top to bottom, non-zero values start appearing in a diagonal pattern, specifically:
   - Each row gets a '2' at positions that mirror the row count but from the end (row 1 gets a '2' at the second-to-last position, row 2 gets a '2' at the third-to-last position, etc.)
   - Once the diagonals reach the opposite corner, a row of '4's appears at the bottom.

Given these observations, here's the transformation process for the test case:

- The first column is all '3's and stays as is.
- The '2's appear diagonally from row 1 to the second-to-last position, row 2 to the third-to-last, etc., until the diagonal reaches the bottom.
- Then, the bottom row is filled with '4's.

Let's apply this to the test case which has a grid size of 10x10:

1. **Pattern Identification**: Looking at the pattern in the examples, we can see that the central number ""5"" in each grid remains unchanged. All other numbers move towards the center along the rows and columns, filling in the gaps left by the shifting numbers.

2. **Movement of Numbers**:
    - In Example 1, the numbers `3` and `0` move to fill the gap next to `5`.
    - In Example 2, the numbers `6` and `6` move to the top row with the gap created by the movement of `5`.
    - In Example 3, the numbers `8`, `8`, `2`, `2`, and `1` move towards the center, filling in the gaps.

3. **General Rule**: The general rule appears to be that non-zero numbers move towards the central column and row while maintaining their relative position to each other. This means that numbers move diagonally or horizontally/vertically closer to the center of the grid.

Applying this understanding to the test case:

- The number `5` remains in place.
- The numbers `3`, `3`, `2`, `2`, `8`, `8`, and `6` need to move towards the central row and column.

Let's apply these movements step-by-step:
1. The `3`s move diagonally to fill the gap.
2. The `2`s move to align with the central row.
3. The `8`s also move accordingly.
4. The `6` moves to fill the remaining gap.

The result of these movements would be:

3. In Example 3, all non-zero rows are moved down one row.
4. In Example 4, all non-zero rows are moved down one row.

From these observations, we can deduce that the transformation involves moving all non-zero rows down by one row. Rows with zeros remain unchanged and fill in any empty spaces at the top after the move.

Applying this rule to the test case:
``` [

Observations:
1. In all examples, the transformation appears to shift certain numbers in a particular pattern.
2. It seems that some numbers move diagonally (upward or downward) depending on their original position.
3. The specific numbers that move are not zero, and they seem to be filling in positions where there was previously a number in their direct diagonal line.

Generalizing the pattern:
- Numbers seem to move up diagonally if possible, while maintaining the same distance from the right edge of the grid.
- If there is a number directly below or above in the diagonal direction, it shifts towards the center of the grid until it hits a border or another non-zero number.

- The '3' at (12,11) moves up to (11,1) and doesn't go further because there is no space left above it.
- The '7' at (6,0) moves up to (5,1), then (4,2), and finally (3,3).

d4a91cb9,"To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the provided input and output grids:

1. The color '8' seems to spread downwards and rightwards until it reaches another non-zero color or the edge of the grid. The spreading value is half of the original color (8 -> 4).
2. Similarly, the color '2' also spreads to the right and downwards, but stops at the edge of the grid or when it encounters another non-zero color.

For the test case:
- We have an '8' in the 9th row and 3rd column.
- We have a '2' in the 3rd row and 12th column.

The '8' should spread downwards and rightwards with the value halved to '4'. The '2' will spread rightwards with its own value.

Applying these rules to the test case:
1. The '8' in the 9th row spreads down and rightwards with '4' filling up subsequent rows and columns until it hits the edge of the grid.
2. The '2' in the 3rd row spreads rightwards with its own value.

```

The '8' spreads downwards and rightwards, while the '2' spreads rightwards. However, the '2' does not spread down because it would overlap with the '4's from the '8' and the rule implies that spreading colors stop before overlapping with other non-zero colors.

4be741c5,"Upon analyzing the provided training examples, it becomes clear that the transformation rule involves identifying the unique colors present in each column of the input grid and condensing them into a single column for the output. Additionally, the colors in the output are sorted in ascending order based on their first appearance from top to bottom in the original input.

Let's break down each example:

1. Example 1: In the input, the leftmost column has only one color (4), the middle column changes from 4 to 2, and the rightmost column changes from 8 to 2. Thus, the output consists of these unique colors in the order they appeared: [4], [2], [8].

2. Example 2: This example shows three columns with colors 2, 8, and 5 appearing sequentially from top to bottom. Hence, the output lists these unique colors in the order they appeared: [2], [8], [5].

3. Example 3: The leftmost column has color 6, the middle column shows a transition to color 4, followed by 2 and eventually 3. The output displays these unique colors in their order of appearance: [6], [4], [2], [3].

Applying this transformation rule to the test case:
The leftmost column starts with 3, the middle column transitions to 2, then to 1, and finally, the rightmost column changes to 8. So, the unique colors from left to right and in the order they first appear are 3, 2, 1, and 8.

29c11459,"To solve the puzzle, I'll follow the pattern observed in the training examples.

In both examples, we have an input grid where certain rows have two distinct non-zero numbers at either end, with zeros in between. The transformation rule involves filling the row with these numbers, expanding from both ends towards the center. A '5' is placed in the middle if the row has an odd length, or between the last pair of numbers on each side if the row has an even length.

Let's apply this observation to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```

[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]
]
```

Step-by-step solution:
1. The first row remains unchanged since there are no non-zero elements.
2. For the second row, starting with 4 and ending with 8, fill the row from both sides towards the center with these numbers, placing a '5' in the middle:
   ```
   [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
   ```
3. The third and fourth rows remain unchanged since they only contain zero values.
4. For the fifth row, starting with 6 and ending with 9, fill the row from both sides towards the center with these numbers, placing a '5' in the middle:
   ```
   [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

4612dd53,"From the provided examples, we can observe that the transformation rule involves changing some of the `1`s into `2`s according to specific patterns:

1. In Example 1, `1`s become `2`s in positions where there is no vertical adjacency with another `1` right above or below but has horizontal adjacency.
2. In Example 2, similar rules apply, but it also shows that if a `1` is isolated horizontally and vertically, it remains a `1`.
3. In Example 3, these rules are consistent, and the transformation respects the neighboring relationships.

To derive the output for the test case, we will follow these steps:
- For each `1`, check its immediate neighbors (above, below, left, right).
- If a `1` does not see another `1` directly above or below but sees one on either side, it changes to a `2`.
- Otherwise, it remains a `1`.

Applying this rule pattern to the test case, we get the following transformation:

995c5fa3,"To solve the transformation rule being applied here, let's take a closer look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs. Each output seems to be a 3x3 grid, which is significantly smaller than the input grids which are 4x14. This suggests that the transformation involves some form of reduction or aggregation of the input grid.

Upon analyzing the provided examples, we notice the following pattern:

1. The transformation appears to be based on counting occurrences of certain configurations within each block of the input grid.
2. Each row of the output seems to correspond to specific row configurations in the input, and columns in the output to specific column configurations in the input.
3. It looks like each number in the output is derived from the sum of appearances of a specific pattern across the input grid, modulo 10 (since the numbers range from 0 to 9).

Observing the transformation more closely, it seems that the output numbers are derived by checking certain conditions and patterns such as the presence of ""5"" and ""0"" in specific positions across the input grid. For instance, the first row of the output might be determined by the frequency of the pattern `[5, 5, 5, 5]` in the input grid, the second row by the frequency of `[5, 0, 5, 0]`, and so forth.

Given these observations, for the test case:
``` 
[
[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5],
[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5],
[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5],
[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]]
```

We would apply the same logic and analyze the patterns within each block similarly to the training examples. From the consistency seen in the transformations, we can infer the following output:

```Answer: [[6, 6, 6], [5, 5, 5], [3, 3, 3]]```

6d0aefbc,"To identify the transformation applied to the input grids to obtain the output grids, let's analyze the differences between the input and output in the training examples.

In all the given examples, it seems that the transformation involves duplicating each column of the original grid and flipping the duplicated columns horizontally around the center. This duplication and flipping results in a mirror image effect across the middle of the grid, doubling its width.

Let's break down the transformation with Example 1:

Input:
```
[6, 6, 6],
[1, 6, 1],
[8, 8, 6]
```

Output:
```
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
[1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1],
[8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8]
```

The first column [6, 1, 8] is mirrored on the right side [8, 1, 6]. Similarly, the second column [6, 6, 8] mirrors around the center to form [8, 6, 6], and the third column [6, 1, 6] forms [6, 1, 6].

Now, we apply this transformation to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```
[6, 8, 6],
[8, 6, 8],
[1, 6, 1]
```

Following the pattern observed, we duplicate and flip each column to construct the output. Here's how it breaks down:

- First column [6, 8, 1] is mirrored to form the last column [1, 8, 6].
- Second column [8, 6, 6] is mirrored to form the second to last column [6, 6, 8].
- Third column [6, 8, 1] matches the first column when mirrored for the third column [1, 8, 6].

Therefore, the output should be:

Answer: ```[[6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 6], [8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8], [1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1]]```","[[6 8 6 6 8 6]

6e19193c,"To find the pattern that transforms the input into the output, we need to observe the changes in the examples given.

In Example 1, the number `7` appears in various positions within the grid. In the output, the `7`s have been redistributed while still maintaining their count. More specifically, the `7`s that originally appeared towards the left and middle of the grid have been mirrored to the right side, creating a symmetrical distribution of `7`s.

In Example 2, the same principle applies but with the number `9`. It shows that the transformation is not limited to `7` but can apply to any number. The `9`s are mirrored across the grid, making the distribution symmetrical if the original placement of `9`s was asymmetrical or re-distributed evenly if they were already distributed.

From these observations, the transformation rule seems to involve redistributing the non-zero numbers across the grid to create symmetry or even distribution while keeping the total number count constant.

Applying this logic to the test case where the number `8` is involved:

The initial positions of `8` in the test case's input grid are:
- Row 2, Column 4
- Row 3, Columns 3 and 4
- Row 4, Columns 7 and 8
- Row 5, Column 8
- Row 6, Columns 2 and 3
- Row 7, Column 4

These should be mirrored or redistributed symmetrically. Here’s the mirrored redistribution for the test case:

ce4f8723,"To solve this puzzle, we should analyze the patterns in the transformation from the given input grids to their corresponding output grids.

Firstly, observe that all the inputs have a similar structure where they are divided into two parts: an upper part with various values (1s and 0s), and a lower part which includes a row of 4s and 2s followed by rows of 0s and 2s.

The transformation rule seems to:
1. Focus on the pattern of 1s and 0s in the upper part of the input grid.
2. Translate the pattern of 1s (and likely significant 0s) into a new pattern using the value 3s and 0s, while ignoring the lower part of the grid.
3. The exact mapping from 1s and 0s to 3s and 0s appears to depend on the adjacency of 1s, but always maintains the grid size in terms of width and height.

Let's apply this understanding to the test case:

Test Input:
```[
[1, 0, 1, 0],
[1, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 1, 0],
[4, 4, 4, 4],
[2, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 2, 0, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 0]]
```

Following the transformation rule observed from the training examples:
- The top rows with 1s and 0s translate into 3s and 0s.
- It appears that any 1 surrounded by 1s or alone is mapped to a 3, and where 1s are not directly adjacent but separated by 0s, those zeros might stay as 0s in the output or transform based on neighboring 1s.

Applying this to the test input:
```[
[3, 3, 3, 0],
[3, 3, 3, 0],
[0, 3, 0, 0],
[3, 3, 3, 0]]
```

The test case input has been processed considering the adjacency and isolation rules of 1s, translating them to 3s and leaving some 0s intact to preserve the original pattern but on a new palette.

Therefore, the answer for the test case is:

928ad970,"To understand the transformation rule applied to the given grids, let's analyze the changes made in the training examples.

In all the provided examples, we observe that regions containing certain 'colors' (non-zero numbers) get expanded outward into surrounding zeroes, essentially filling the area around these colored sections with the color that was present inside them. This expansion appears to extend to contiguous areas of zeros around the original shapes, effectively creating a 'buffer' or 'outline' of the initial non-zero regions while leaving other zero-valued cells untouched unless they are part of the expanding region.

Let's break down the process:

1. Identify non-zero numbered clusters within the grid.
2. Expand these clusters outwards, replacing adjacent zeros with the cluster's number until there are no more zeros adjacent to any part of the cluster.

Using this logic on the test case:

- Cluster of `8`s should expand outwards, filling all adjacent zeros.
- The `5` at position `[8, 13]` should also expand around its immediate neighbors.

Therefore, applying this to the test case, we can predict the transformation. Here's the solution:

af902bf9,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes from the input to the output in the example cases provided.

In Example 1, the central cell (5th row, 6th column) becomes '2' in the output while other '4's remain unchanged, except they are bordered by '0's.

In Example 2, a block of '2's fills the space between two '4's in the 2nd and 7th columns of the 2nd row. 

In Example 3, a '2' appears directly above and below a single '4' at (3rd row, 3rd column), and another block of '2's appears in the bottom rows between the '4's in the 5th and 10th columns.

The common pattern seems to be that a '2' fills a space between two '4's, whether vertically, horizontally, or in a block where '4's form a boundary.

Applying this transformation rule to the test case:

- There are '4's at (1st row, 6th column) and (1st row, 10th column). Therefore, we should fill the space between them with '2'.
- Similarly, there are '4's at (5th row, 6th column) and (5th row, 10th column), so we fill the space between those as well.
- We also have '4's at (6th row, 1st column), (6th row, 4th column), (9th row, 1st column), and (9th row, 4th column), but no contiguous space for '2's to fill here.

77fdfe62,"Upon analyzing the given examples, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

1. The transformation involves a downsampling process where each output cell aggregates information from a block of cells in the input grid.
2. The aggregation seems to focus on the corner cells of each block in the input and transfers their values directly to the corresponding output cell.
3. The block size appears to be 2x2 for Examples 1 and 3 and 3x3 for Example 2.

For Example 1:
- Each 2x2 block in the input is transformed into one cell in the output, taking the value from the top-left corner of the block.

For Example 2:
- Each 3x3 block in the input is transformed into one cell in the output, also taking the value from the top-left corner of the block.

For Example 3:
- Similar to Example 1, each 2x2 block in the input is transformed into one cell in the output by taking the value from the top-left corner.

Therefore, the rule appears to be consistent with block sizes of 2x2 for most cases, except for Example 2 which has an exception with a 3x3 block. Considering the majority of the examples use a 2x2 block, let's apply a 2x2 block transformation to the test case.

Let's perform this transformation for the test case:

cbded52d,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the transformation rule based on the provided examples.

Looking at the examples:

- In Example 1, the cells with '4' in the fifth column were changed in some rows.
- Example 2 shows similar changes where cells with '3' in the fifth column were changed.
- Example 3 also shows cells with '3' in the fifth column being repeated.

The common pattern appears to be the duplication of the value in the fifth column into the seventh column for all rows that have non-zero values in the fifth column.

Now let's apply this rule to the Test case:

1. Identify all non-zero values in the fifth column.
2. Copy those values to the seventh column.

The fifth column in the test case contains `1` and `1` and `1` and `6`, which means we'll need to copy those values over to the corresponding positions in the seventh column.

Here's the transformed test case:

49d1d64f,"To find the transformation rule, let's analyze how each test example input grid is transformed into its corresponding output grid:

1. **Grid Expansion**: The first noticeable change is that the output grids are larger than their respective input grids. Specifically, if an input grid is `n x m`, the output grid is `(n+2) x (m+2)`. This suggests that each input grid is extended on all sides.

2. **Border Addition**: In each of the output grids, the outer cells (a border of width 1) are filled with zeros (`0`). This indicates that the transformation adds a zero border around the original grid.

3. **Inner Grid Transformation**:
   - The inner part of the output grid is essentially an expanded version of the input grid. 
   - Each element in the input appears twice horizontally and vertically in the output, forming a block pattern. For instance, an input value that is `1` will appear as a `2 x 2` block of `1`s in the output grid.

Using these observations, let's apply this transformation rule to the test case:

Input Test Case:
```
[
[2, 8],
[1, 4],
[3, 4]]
```

Applying the transformation steps:
1. Expand the grid to `(n+2) x (m+2)` where `n=3` and `m=2`. So, the new grid size is `5 x 4`.
2. Add a border of zeros around the new grid.
3. Fill the inner part of the grid according to the pattern described; each element in the input repeats twice in both directions.

The resulting transformation would look like this:

- First row and last row: All zeros.
- Second row and fourth row: Start and end with zeros, and the inner section repeats the values from the test-case rows.
- Third row: Directly repeats the second row but without the border zeros.

Therefore, the output grid should be:

```Answer: [
[0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 2, 2, 8, 8],

[0, 3, 3, 4, 4],
[0, 3, 3, 4, 4],
[0, 0, 0, 0]]

However, based on our initial analysis, the correct size should be `5x4`, hence the corrected output would be:

c8cbb738,"To derive the transformation rule from the given examples:

1. Observe the dimensions of the input and output grids. For example 1, the input is a 12x11 grid while the output is a 5x5 grid. Example 2 goes from an 8x10 input to a 3x3 output. This suggests a reduction in size by selecting specific cells.
   
2. Look at the patterns in each input and output. The outputs seem to retain a subset of the input's unique numbers but exclude the background color (often the most frequent number in the input).

3. In all examples, the output grids appear to be centered around the non-background numbers in the input. It seems that the output is derived by taking a central section of the input, ignoring the border of a single layer of background color.

4. Upon closer inspection, it also appears that the output grid dimensions are not necessarily tied to a specific formula based on the input size but rather focused on capturing the essential patterns, likely excluding the outermost layers until only a square with meaningful variations remains.

Applying these observations to the test case, I notice:

- The background color is 8, and the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 make up the pattern within it.
- To get an output grid of meaningful variation, we would look for a central square that captures those numbers while excluding the surrounding 8s.

Let's extract the central part of the input grid that contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6, without the surrounding 8s:

834ec97d,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the transformation rule applied in the provided examples. Observing these, we can conclude:

1. The transformation adds a pattern of '4's along with '0's in every second row and column, up to the row where the first non-zero value appears.
2. Once a non-zero value (other than '0') is found, rows above it and columns around it follow a specific pattern of '4's and '0's.
3. All rows below the row which contains the first non-zero value remain unchanged.

For example, in Example 1, the non-zero value '2' is located at the second position on the first row, so the second row gets filled with '4's and '0's in a pattern, and the remaining rows stay unchanged as zeros.

Applying this rule to the test case, the value '3' appears on the 5th position on the 4th row. Thus:
- Rows 1 to 3 (before the one containing the first non-zero value) should have alternating '4's and '0's.
- Row 4 (where the first non-zero value '3' appears) should have alternating '4's and '0's up to the column of the non-zero value, followed by zeros.
- Rows 5 and onwards stay the same as the original input.

In this test case, the non-zero color in the bottom-left corner is `2`, which should replace all occurrences of the non-zero color `8`.

6773b310,"To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided training examples.

The common pattern seen in all the examples is that the middle row consists entirely of 8s, and this row seems to act as a dividing line for the grid. We can infer that the transformation takes place by focusing on the rows above and below the center row separately and then mapping these to the output grid.

In each example, we see that the output is a 3x3 grid. This suggests that the transformation might involve condensing the information from the input grid into a smaller form, specifically a 3x3 grid.

The presence of non-zero values (particularly 6 and 8) outside the central row appears significant. Here's how the transformation could work:

1. The input grid is divided into three sections horizontally: top third, middle third (all 8s), and bottom third.
2. Each section is further divided into columns.
3. For each column in each section, we check if there are any non-zero values (excluding 8, since it's consistent across the middle row).
4. If there are non-zero values in a column section, the corresponding cell in the output grid is set to 1. Otherwise, it remains 0.

Let’s apply this rule to our test case:

```plaintext
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6, 0, 6],
[0, 6, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], # Middle row 
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 6, 0],
[0, 0, 6, 8, 0, 6, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], # Another middle row
[0, 0, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 6, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 6, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]]
```

We'll divide the grid into three horizontal sections, then columns within each section, and check for non-zero values (other than 8).

- Top third:
  - Column 1: [0, 0, 0] -> 0
  - Column 2: [0, 6, 0] -> 1
  - Column 3: [0, 0, 0] -> 0

- Bottom third:
  - Column 1: [0, 0, 6] -> 1
  - Column 2: [0, 0, 0] -> 0
  - Column 3: [0, 6, 0] -> 1

Now we fill the output grid based on the presence of non-zero values in each column section:

44d8ac46,"The transformation applied to the input grids seems to involve changing certain cells with a value of `0` to the color `2`. Specifically, these changes occur in areas where there are enclosed `5`s surrounded by other `5`s or `0`s.

To identify which `0`s should be changed to `2`s, we need to consider the following conditions:
- If a `0` is fully enclosed within `5`s such that it cannot ""escape"" to the edge of the grid without crossing over a `5`, it should be turned into a `2`.
- This means `0`s that are next to the edge of the grid or are not completely surrounded by `5`s do not change.

67385a82,"To solve the test case, let's examine the transformation rule based on the examples provided.

From all training examples we can observe that:
- Any instance of the digit `3` is changed to an `8`, except when it is in a column with a `0` directly above or below it.
- If a `3` is present in a column where there is at least one `0` above or below it, that `3` remains unchanged.

With these rules in mind, let's apply them to the test case:

Test Case: Input
```
[
[3, 0, 3, 0, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
[0, 3, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 3, 3, 0, 0]]
```

Transforming according to the rules:
- The `3`s in the first and third columns should remain `3`s because they have `0`s above or below them.
- All other `3`s not in the first and third columns should be changed to `8`s.

Therefore, the transformed output would be:
```python
[
[8, 0, 8, 0, 8],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 3],

a416b8f3,"Let's analyze the transformation rule used in the training examples.

**Observation from Example 1:**
- The original grid was of size 3x3.
- The new grid is of size 3x6.
- It seems every column in the original grid has been repeated once to double its width while keeping the height the same.

**Observation from Example 2:**
- The original grid was of size 4x3.
- The new grid is of size 4x6.
- Again, every column in the original grid appears to have been duplicated to double the width.

**Observation from Example 3:**
- The original grid was of size 4x4.
- The new grid is of size 4x8.
- The same rule applies: columns have been duplicated to double the width.

From these observations, it seems the transformation rule involves duplicating each column of the original grid to create a new grid that is double as wide as the original but keeps the same height.

Now let's apply this rule to the test case:

**Test Grid:**
```
[
[4, 0, 0, 0],
[4, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 6, 0],
[6, 6, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 1]
]
```

**Applying the Rule:**
- Each of the four columns will be duplicated.
- This means the output will be a 5x8 grid.

So the new grid with duplicated columns will look like this:
```
[
[4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[4, 4, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],

1b2d62fb,"To solve the test case, we need to find the pattern or rule that transforms the input grids into output grids. Let's analyze the provided examples.

### Observations:
- Each input grid has a fixed column (column at index 3) where the value `1` appears in every row.
- In the output grids, the `1` and surrounding cells with value `9` are replaced with `8` in certain patterns. 
- The rest of the elements in the grid that are not part of these transformations are set to `0`.

### Pattern Identification:
1. For every input, the `8`s appear in a vertical column corresponding to where the `1`s were located.
2. The `8`s extend upwards and downwards based on the presence of `9`s directly adjacent to `1`s (vertically and horizontally).
3. If a `1` is surrounded by `9`s, it creates a vertical band of `8`s that stretches to the length of the continuous `9`s.

### Applying the Pattern:
Given the test case input:

```
[
[9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0],
[0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0],
[9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 0, 9],
[0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 9, 9]]
```

We identify positions of `1` and `9`:
- Row 1: `[9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0]` -> `9` on either side of `1`, so we have an `8`.
- Row 2: `[0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0]` -> No `9` on either side of `1`, so no extended `8`.
- Row 3: `[9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0]` -> `9` on either side of `1`, so we have an `8`.
- Row 4: `[9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 0, 9]` -> `9` on either side of `1`, so we have an `8`.
- Row 5: `[0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 9, 9]` -> `9` on either side of `1`, so we have an `8`.

Based on the observed pattern, the resulting output grid is:

``` 
[
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

However, since the transformation only affects the vertical column of `1` and the surrounding `9`s, the final output grid should match the pattern seen in the examples, with only the relevant cells showing `8`s.

Thus, the transformation yields:

``` 
[
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 0],
[0, 8, 0],
[0, 8, 0],
[0, 8, 0]

d511f180,"To determine the transformation rule applied in the provided examples, let's compare each input with its corresponding output systematically.

Observing Example 1:
- The number `8` appears to replace `5` in the first row.
- In the second row, `8` replaces `5`.
- In the third row, `8` replaces `5`.
- In the fourth row, `8` replaces `5`.
- In the fifth row, there’s no replacement because `5` does not appear.

Examining Example 2:
- Here, `5`s are replaced by `8`s in the first row and second row.

Looking at Example 3:
- Again, `5`s are replaced by `8`s except when `5` is on the edge or already surrounded by certain other numbers (`7`, `8`).

Based on the above observations, the pattern suggests that any occurrence of the number `5` is replaced by the number `8`, unless it appears on the boundary or has specific neighbors that prevent it from being replaced.

Let's apply this rule to the Test case:

Test Input:
``` [
[8, 8, 4, 5],
[3, 8, 7, 5],
[3, 7, 1, 9],
[6, 4, 8, 8]

Therefore, the output should be:

[3, 8, 7, 8],
[3, 7, 1, 9],

Observations:
1. Each row in the output grid consists of blocks of the same numbers or zeros.
2. The numbers 5 seem to act as separators, meaning that no other number appears on the opposite side of a 5 in the output.
3. For rows that don't contain 5s, all non-zero numbers are replaced with the same value.
4. Rows containing only zeros remain unchanged or are filled with zeros.

Let's apply these rules to the test case:

1. For each row, identify the numbers that are not 5.
2. Replace all non-zero numbers in a row with the first non-zero number encountered in that row or leave zeros if there are no non-zero numbers.

- The surrounding area of the grid is filled with the outermost non-zero color values from the original grid, creating a border. The border follows the color pattern of the outermost row and column of the original grid, expanded symmetrically.

Let's analyze the Test Case:

Input:
```
[
[7, 7, 3, 2, 2],
[7, 7, 3, 2, 2],
[3, 3, 3, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]
```

The outermost non-zero colors are:
- Top Row: [7, 7, 3, 2, 2]
- Right Column: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] (all 2s)
- Bottom Row: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] (all 2s)
- Left Column: [7, 7, 3, 2, 2]

The output should follow this pattern with the original grid in the center and the surrounding areas filled with 2s and other outermost values appropriately.

Output:
```

810b9b61,"To approach the problem, let's first observe the patterns in the transformations from the input to the output grids across the examples provided:

1. In all examples, certain groups of `1`s are replaced with `3`s.
2. The groups of `1`s that are replaced with `3`s seem to be surrounded by `0`s on all sides or by the edges of the grid. This implies that these groups of `1`s are isolated.
3. Not all `1`s are replaced with `3`s; only those that are part of the isolated groups.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to be: Replace all `1` cells that are part of an isolated group (i.e., surrounded by `0`s) with `3`s.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- The middle left cluster (2x2)

7b7f7511,"To derive the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's analyze the changes from inputs to outputs in each:

1. **Size Reduction**: In all given examples, the size of the output grid is reduced in comparison to the input grid. This reduction can be seen more clearly by looking at the dimensions of the matrices.

   - Example 1: Input has 8 columns, while the output has 4 columns.
   - Example 2: Input has 6 columns, while the output has 3 columns.
   - Example 3: Input has 2 columns and 6 rows, whereas the output has 2 columns and 3 rows.

2. **Column/Row Grouping and Removal**: It looks like columns (or rows) are being grouped together and then reduced. More specifically, every two columns (or rows) in the input are combined into one column (or row) in the output.

   - Example 1: First two columns from the input become the first column in the output and so on.
   - Example 2: Every two columns from the input are combined into one.
   - Example 3: First two rows from the input become the first row in the output and so on.

Based on this observation, the transformation appears to be a process where the input matrix is halved by combining pairs of adjacent columns or rows.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input:
```plaintext
[
[5, 4, 5],
[4, 5, 4],
[6, 6, 4],
[2, 6, 2],
[5, 4, 5],
[4, 5, 4],
[6, 6, 4],
[2, 6, 2]]
```

Since it doesn't have an even number of columns but has an even number of rows, we can assume the reduction happens vertically (rows). We combine pairs of adjacent rows:

- Row 1 + Row 2 = Row 1 of the output
- Row 3 + Row 4 = Row 2 of the output
- Row 5 + Row 6 = Row 3 of the output
- Row 7 + Row 8 = Row 4 of the output

The combination could involve any method, but in this case, just keeping the first row of each pair seems consistent with the pattern shown in the examples.

Output:
```plaintext
[
[5, 4, 5],
[6, 6, 4],
[5, 4, 5],
[6, 6, 4]

d9fac9be,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids, let's analyze the provided training examples. The transformation seems to involve identifying a dominant color that appears consistently in certain patterns or areas within the grid. The output in all cases has been a single value surrounded by zeros.

1. In Example 1, the dominant color is `2` which consistently appears in the first and third columns of the first row. The other numbers `4` appear in the middle sections, but they are not isolated in any clear pattern.
2. In Example 2, the dominant color is `8`. This number appears in the corners of the grid and along one column, making it a likely candidate for the transformation output.
3. In Example 3, the dominant color `1` is spread across the grid, especially in the middle rows and columns, indicating its dominance over the less frequent `2`s.
4. In Example 4, the number `8` is the most consistent in both frequency and pattern, appearing in the center and corners of the grid.

The common rule that can be derived here is to identify the most frequently recurring number in the grid, excluding `0`, which seems to act as a background or filler. For the test case:

- The grid contains numbers `0`, `1`, `4`.
- The number `1` appears more frequently than `4` and is also spread across the grid in a more consistent manner.

Therefore, the most dominant color in the test case is `1`.

d90796e8,"To determine the transformation rule applied in the examples, let's carefully examine the changes made from the inputs to the respective outputs.

Observing Example 1:
The input has a `3` at index [0][0] while the output has an `8` at that position. This suggests a possible transformation rule where a specific color value is changed to another value. However, other values in the grid remain unchanged. 

Examining Example 2:
Here, the transformation occurs only on the third row (index 1) and the fourth column (index 3). The color `3` at index [1][2] becomes an `8`, and similarly, the `3` at index [3][1] also becomes an `8`. It does not seem to be a simple replacement rule based solely on the value itself, since the `2` at index [3][5] remains unaltered though it's in the same column as the one changed from `3` to `8`.

Considering Example 3:
This exhibits a similar behavior as Example 2, with specific instances of `3` turning into `8`, but no other changes occur for repeated occurrences of `2` or `5`. Notably, `3` is consistently replaced by `8`, but the transformation seems to depend on its surroundings or position rather than just the color value alone.

From these observations, we infer that the transformation involves changing the number `3` to `8` under certain conditions, possibly related to their positions within the grid. However, the exact condition is not clear based on just the given examples, but it appears consistent with the pattern identified.

Applying this inferred rule to the test case:

The test case has a few `3`s:
- At index [1][1]
- At index [2][1]
- At index [6][1]
- At index [6][2]

Following the transformation rule inferred (replacing `3` with `8`), let's modify just those positions.

### Observations from Training Examples:

1. **Pattern Identification:** In all three examples, there are vertical stripes of `5` and blocks of other numbers that are surrounded by zeros. It appears that some zeros are changing into other digits (`1`, `2`, or `3`) but only within certain conditions.
   
2. **Transformation of Zeros:** 
   - Zeros near the edges or corners are often replaced with `1`.
   - Zeros adjacent to the central blocks of `5` are changed to `2`.
   - Zeros at the bottom right corner or near the vertical block of `5` on the right are replaced with `3`.

3. **Consistency Check:**
   - The `5`s remain unchanged.
   - All transformations seem to follow a similar pattern of filling the empty spaces with new numbers based on their position relative to `5`-blocks and the edges of the grid.

### Applying the Pattern to the Test Case:

Let's apply these observations to the test case provided:

Given Test Input:
```python
[
[0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0],

[0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0]]
```

Based on the observations, the expected changes are:
- Zeros at the top left of the first row and bottom right of the last row will become `1`.
- Zeros between the `5` blocks in the middle rows will become `2`.
- Zeros in the bottom right of the last few rows will become `3`.

Let’s make these changes:

```python
[
[1, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0],  # Leading zero becomes 1

[0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 2, 5, 0, 5, 0],  # Middle zeros become 2

[0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 3]]  # Trailing zeros become 3

a79310a0,"To derive the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples.

In all the examples, we see that any `8` in the input grid becomes a `2` in the output grid. However, these `2`s appear one row lower than their corresponding `8`s in the input. Any cell that was not an `8` remains a `0`. This indicates a simple vertical shift of the cells with value `8` down by one row, and then replacing `8` with `2`.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Given Test Case Input:
``` [
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

We'll move each `8` down by one row and change it to `2`.

- The `8` at `[0][2]` moves to `[1][2]`.
- The first `8` at `[1][1]` moves to `[2][1]`. 
- The second `8` at `[1][2]` moves to `[2][2]`.
- The `8` at `[2][2]` moves to `[3][2]`.

ce9e57f2,"To find the transformation rule from the input to the output grids, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. Observe that the color `2` is present in every input and output grid.
2. The transformation involves changing certain `2`s to `8` based on specific conditions.
3. In all examples, the transformation seems to occur after some specific row and column pattern of `2`s appears.

Based on the patterns observed:
- The transformation begins at rows with multiple `2` appearances, particularly when there is a vertical pattern of `2`s in certain columns.
- Once a vertical pattern of `2`s is established, subsequent appearances of `2` in those columns transform to `8` when they appear in new rows.

Let's apply this logic to the test case input:
1. Identify the initial vertical patterns of `2`.
2. Transform subsequent `2`s into `8` in those columns.

Here's the step-by-step application of the rule to the test case:
1. Notice the vertical patterns of `2` starting from the second row.
2. Apply the rule where `2` changes to `8` in later rows as per the pattern.

eb281b96,"To identify the transformation applied, let's analyze what changes from the input to the output in the provided examples:

1. **Pattern Repetition**: In both examples, the output includes repetition of the rows found in the input. It seems that the pattern present in the input is repeated in the output but with more rows.

2. **Row Sequencing**: The row sequencing is consistent with what we see in the input, but extended. The first few rows are identical to the input, followed by repetitions of these rows in the same order.

In Example 1:
- The input has 3 rows.
- The output repeats these rows to a total of 9 rows, preserving the initial pattern.

In Example 2:
- The input has 4 rows.
- The output repeats these rows to a total of 13 rows, again maintaining the initial pattern.

Thus, the transformation rule seems to be to extend the pattern by repeating the sequence of rows several times.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The test input has 5 rows.
- Following the pattern observed, we should repeat these rows to create a larger grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

```python
[
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],

d6ad076f,"Let's analyze the pattern transformation from the training examples:

**Observation 1:** 
In all examples, if a section of the grid has at least four consecutive cells with the same color in both rows and columns (like a block or a square), a new color appears in the center of that block.

**Observation 2:** 
The new color introduced is `8`, and it's placed inside the central area of the block. It does not overlap with the original color's outer boundary.

- **Example 1:** A block of `2`s forms a rectangle in the top middle section of the grid. In the center of the block, a block of `8`s appears.

- **Example 2:** A similar situation occurs where a `4` block touches a `6` block. Between these two blocks, a vertical column of `8`s appears in the overlapping middle section.

- **Example 3:** A horizontal block of `3`s sits on the top and a rectangular block of `9`s at the bottom. In the middle of the grid, a block of `8`s appears.

Given that we understand the transformation rule:

- The `8` color appears as a block in the center of any existing block which extends at least four cells in both directions (horizontally and vertically).

Let's apply this rule to the test case provided:

The test case has a large block of `1`s at the left side and a smaller block of `2`s at the right side, both extending across multiple rows. Based on the observed transformation rules, we should place an `8` block in the center of the `1`s block.

This results in:

    - The sequence begins with `[0,1]`.

2. **Example 2**: 
    - Input has one `1` in the second position of the last row.
    - Output alternates between `[0,1,0]`, `[1,0,0]`, and `[0,0,1]`.

    - The sequence starts with `[0,0,0,1]`.

From these examples, we can see a pattern where the digit `1` is rotated among all positions in the last row and this rotation pattern is then repeated in reverse order throughout the entire grid.

For the test case:
- The input has one `1` in the fourth position of the last row.

Observation 3: The central area where `8`s are found in the input grids seems to be what forms the pattern in the 3x3 output grid. However, when `8`s are surrounded by `5`s, they form the non-zero elements in the output.

For each input grid, we can see the central block of `8`s being ""extracted"" and placed into the output grid while maintaining relative positions in the 3x3 format.

From the examples:

1. The output grid size is always double that of the input grid (both in height and width).
2. Each value in the input grid appears twice horizontally and twice vertically in the output grid.
3. The pattern of the input grid is preserved but repeated, doubling the size of each individual cell in both dimensions.

Let's apply these rules to the given test case.

a2fd1cf0,"To solve the test case, let's first identify the pattern or rule used in transforming inputs to outputs based on the training examples.

Observations:
1. In all examples, there are certain numbers that are not part of the transformation (e.g., '2' and '3' remain unchanged).
2. The number '8' appears as an expansion around the numbers '2' and '3'.
3. It seems that the '8' fills the space between the numbers '2' and '3', creating a sort of boundary or flood fill effect.
4. The '8' does not expand over the entire grid but only fills up areas between the numbers (like a flood fill).

Based on these observations, we conclude that the transformation rule involves filling with '8's the spaces between the numbers '2' and '3', and the '8's do not spill beyond these bounds.

Applying this logic to the Test Case:
- We have a '2' at position (2, 1) and a '3' at position (10, 9).
- An '8' should fill the area between these two numbers.

4c4377d9,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids, let's analyze the pattern in the provided examples:

1. Each output grid has double the number of rows compared to its corresponding input grid.
2. The output grid repeats the entire pattern found in the input grid, but with an additional row inserted after the middle row of the input grid which mirrors the top half of the input grid.

For instance, in Example 1, the input grid has 3 rows, and the output grid has 6 rows. The first three rows of the output grid are the direct copy of the input grid. The last three rows of the output grid are also a copy of the input grid, but in reverse order.

Let's apply this understanding to the test case:

Input
``` 
[
[4, 4, 9, 9],
[4, 4, 4, 4],
[4, 4, 9, 9]]
```

1. Copy the first half of the input grid (which consists of the top two rows).
2. Insert a mirrored version of the top half after the second row.
3. Copy the whole input grid again after the mirrored part.

Thus, the output should look as follows:

Output
```
[
[4, 4, 9, 9],
[4, 4, 4, 4],
[4, 4, 9, 9],  # Mirrored version of the first row
[4, 4, 4, 4],  # Mirrored version of the second row
[4, 4, 9, 9],
[4, 4, 4, 4],
[4, 4, 9, 9]]
```

However, since the pattern involves mirroring only the top half to fill the gaps before repeating the input grid, the correct mirrored rows are only those from the top half of the input grid. Thus, the proper mirrored portion should be only the first two rows.

So, the correct transformation would give us:

Answer: ```

For Example 1, we see that:
- The region of color 2 at the bottom middle spreads horizontally to the left and right.
- Below it, new areas of color 1 appear within the bounds of the expanded region of color 2.

Similarly, in Example 2:
- The lone color 2s and 1s seem to be connected by forming bridges of color 1 across the gaps.

In Example 3:
- The topmost region of color 1 grows downward, filling the space under the region of color 2 below it.

From these, it appears that the rule involves expanding regions of color such that:
1. Color regions can extend into adjacent empty spaces (color 0).
2. When two regions of the same color are separated by empty space, the space may fill up with that color.
3. If there are two different colors next to each other, a new area of another color (not present but common in the examples, often color 1) may bridge them.

Applying this pattern to the Test case:
- There's a region of color 1 on the left and a region of color 2 on the right in the middle rows. The color 1 should expand towards the color 2.
- At the bottom, the region of color 2 should be connected to those above it.

The solution could look something like this:

a699fb00,"To solve the transformation rule based on the given examples, I observe that in every input-output pair, there's an additional color pattern introduced into the grid where '2' values appear next to '1' values. This pattern seems to follow these observations:

1. For every '1' in the input grid, if it is not at the edge of the grid, the adjacent cells (to the left, right, above, and below) are filled with '2' in the output grid.
2. If a '1' is located at the edge or corner of the grid, only the adjacent cells within the grid boundary are filled with '2'.
3. '0' values remain unchanged.

Applying these rules to the test case:

The initial grid:
``` [
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

0ca9ddb6,"To determine the transformation rule, we need to analyze the changes from the input to the output in each training example.

Observing the changes:

1. In Example 1, the value `4` appears symmetrically around the non-zero values `2` and `1`, and another new value `7` is introduced.
2. In Example 2, similar patterns of symmetry and introduction of new values can be seen. Values such as `4` and `7` are introduced around existing non-zero values.
3. In Example 3, again we see symmetric patterns with `4`, `7` around the original non-zero values while also introducing `6`.

Based on these observations, the rules seem to be:
- Non-zero numbers are surrounded by symmetrical patterns of other numbers that weren't present before.
- New numbers appear at specific locations that seem to relate to the position of the initial non-zero numbers.

For the test case:
```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],

[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Following the observed pattern, the surrounding numbers should appear symmetrically around `1`, `2`, `8`, and `6`, `2`. We apply the transformation accordingly:

```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

7447852a,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples:

- In all cases, the first column remains unchanged.
- The last column of the second row gets a 4 when there was a 0 in the input.
- For the third row, zeros in positions that are multiples of 4 (considering 1st position as 0) turn into 4s in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:
1. Leave the first column the same.
2. Add a 4 at the end of the second row if its last element was a 0.
3. Change any zero in the third row to a 4 if it's located in a position that is a multiple of 4 (starting count from 0).

Applying this rule to the test case:

Starting with the first row, only the first column remains unchanged:
``` 
[2, ..., ...]
```
For the second row, the last number changes from 0 to 4:
```
[4, ..., ..., 4]
```
In the third row, every fourth position from the start (which includes the first position, considered 0), changes from 0 to 4:
```
[4, ..., ..., 4, ..., ..., 4, ..., ..., 4, ..., ..., 4]

28e73c20,"The transformation rule appears to fill the outermost layer of the grid with 3s. In the second layer, all corners are also filled with 3s while the rest remains 0s. This pattern continues inwards, alternating layers of entirely 3s and partially filled layers with 3s only at the edges and corners, until the innermost layer or region.

Given the test case, we can apply the same transformation rule:

1. Fill the outermost layer with 3s.
2. For the next layer inward, fill the corners and edges with 3s, leaving the interior as 0s.
3. Continue this alternating pattern until reaching the center.

For an 18x18 grid, the transformation would look like this:

3906de3d,"To deduce the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes from input to output in the provided examples:

1. In all examples, there are sections with 1s and isolated sections with 2s separated by zeros.
2. The transformation rule appears to propagate the color 2 upwards into any adjacent 1s until it is blocked by zeros.
3. This propagation seems to happen from bottom to top, filling all accessible cells containing 1s above any 2s.

Let's apply this understanding to the test case:

Input:
```python
[
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0]
]
```

Following the propagation rule, we can see:
- The 2 at position (4,8) will propagate up to fill all 1s above it in its column, except where blocked by 0s.
- Similarly, the 2s in row 7, 8, 9, and 10 will propagate to the 1s above them in their respective columns.

Propagating these changes, the output would be:

5521c0d9,"To solve the transformation rule that converts the input grids into output grids based on the given examples, let's observe and analyze the patterns in the transformations:

1. Each transformation seems to result in an output grid where shapes or color blocks from the input grid are moved upwards or sideways, but not downwards.
2. Color blocks which share a row or column with other blocks of the same color seem to move together as a unit.
3. Blocks of different colors do not overlap after the transformation, suggesting they move independently of each other.

With these observations, we can interpret the rules as follows:

- Each distinct colored block should be moved up as far as possible without overlapping with another block. If there are multiple blocks of the same color in the same column, all such blocks need to be shifted up while maintaining their relative positions.
  
Let's apply these rules to the test case provided:

The input grid contains three types of blocks:
- A block of 2s at the top,
- A block of 4s below the 2s, 
- A block of 1s at the bottom.

According to our rules, each block moves up:
- The block of 2s will move up until reaching the top edge.
- The block of 4s will follow the block of 2s, moving up until reaching the row below the block of 2s.
- The block of 1s will follow the block of 4s, moving up until reaching the row below the block of 4s.

Applying these transformations, we get the following output grid:

c8f0f002,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids, let's examine the changes in the provided examples:

1. In Example 1, all occurrences of `7` in the input grid have been replaced with `5` in the output grid.
2. Similarly, in Example 2, all instances of `7` are replaced with `5`.
3. The same pattern holds true for Example 3 where `7`s are substituted with `5`s.

Based on these observations, it seems that the transformation rule is to replace all occurrences of `7` with `5`.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```[
[1, 7, 7, 1, 7],
[8, 1, 7, 7, 7],

508bd3b6,"Let's analyze the transformation rules from the provided examples:

1. **Identify the Pattern**: In each example, the number '8' in the input appears to serve as a starting point for a ""spread"" or ""filling"" pattern. The color '3' seems to be spread from the positions of the '8', filling in empty spaces ('0') in a diagonal manner until it hits either another color or the edge of the grid.

2. **Diagonal Spread Rule**:
    - From each '8', the color '3' spreads diagonally down towards the lower right corner.
    - This spreading stops when it reaches the edge of the grid, another non-zero value, or when it intersects with another diagonal spread path of '3'.

3. **Examples Analysis**:
    - **Example 1**: There are two '8's at the bottom. They spread diagonally upwards and to the left, placing '3's where there were zeros.
    - **Example 2**: The '8's are scattered and spread diagonally as per the rule, avoiding the already filled '2's.
    - **Example 3**: Here, the '8's are also at the bottom but in different positions, causing a different set of diagonal paths.

4. **Apply the Rule to Test Case**:
    - In the test case, there are two '8's positioned above the block of '2's.
    - Following the diagonal spread rule, we'll fill '3's in the empty cells leading down to the block of '2's.

Based on these observations, the transformation should result in the following output for the test case:

1e0a9b12,"To determine the transformation rule being applied to the grids, let's analyze the changes from input to output in the training examples.

**Observations:**

1. In all cases, the top rows that are entirely composed of 0s or mostly zeros get removed/replaced with all-0s rows.
2. Any non-zero elements appear to move downwards until they reach a row where there isn't already a non-zero element in the same column, unless it's the bottommost row.
3. Non-zero elements at the bottom are not moved.
4. If there are multiple non-zero values in one column, the ones above are moved down to fill gaps created by previously moved elements.

Using these observations, we can apply the rules to the test case grid:

Test Case Input:
``` [ [0, 2, 0, 4, 3], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [5, 2, 0, 4, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0] ] ```

Let's transform it step-by-step:
- Identify non-zero elements: `2`, `4`, `3`, `5`, `6`, `5`, `2`, `4`, `5`.
- Move `2` in row 1, column 2 to the next available spot, which is row 4, column 2.
- Move `4` in row 1, column 4 to row 4, column 4.
- Move `3` in row 1, column 5 to row 4, column 5.
- Row `[5, 0, 0, 0, 0]` moves to the third row since the first three positions are empty.
- `6` stays in place as it is the only non-zero value in its column.
- Bottom rows are adjusted accordingly.

Therefore, the output should look like:
```

54d9e175,"To find the solution to the test case, we need to figure out the pattern or rule applied in transitioning the grids from input to output.

Analyzing all training examples, we can observe the following pattern:

- The number `5` remains unchanged.
- Every sequence of zeros surrounded by numbers (on either side) is replaced with a repeating sequence of two distinct numbers.
- The pattern of replacing zeros alternates in such a way that the left zero block alternates between the next highest unused number (starting from 6) and the right zero block gets the next subsequent number.
- The numbers used to replace zeros seem to increment based on the unique non-zero numbers within the input grid, starting from 6.

From the patterns observed in the training examples, we can infer the transformation rule:

1. For every column of zeros on the left side (before the first `5`), use a number starting from 6 and increase it for each new unique non-zero number encountered.
2. For every column of zeros on the right side (after the last `5`), use the number immediately higher than the one used for the left side.
3. When a row全是5的，它保持不变。

f15e1fac,"To solve the test case, let's first analyze the pattern used in transforming the inputs into the outputs from the training examples.

In Example 1, we see that an 8 appears in the first row, and this pattern seems to extend downwards and to the left in subsequent rows. Specifically, whenever there's an 8 or a 2 in the initial configuration, the 8s propagate in a certain direction according to their initial position until they reach the next element in the column, which could be another 8 or 2.

In Example 2, the 8s propagate horizontally from right to left, and vertically down from the top, spreading out based on the initial pattern of these numbers.

In Example 3, the situation is a bit more complex. Here, the 8s propagate in a block-like fashion. Each initial 8 seems to trigger an 8-block of 4x4 size around its position. The 2s remain unaffected.

Given these observations, we can deduce a rule: For an 8 or 2 in the grid, the 8 propagates in a block-like pattern around it until it encounters the edge of the grid or another number.

Now, let's apply this rule to our Test Case:

The Test Case has several 8s placed at various positions, and a 2 near the bottom. We'll propagate the 8s in blocks and leave the 2 unchanged.

Applying the propagation rules:
- The 8 at position [2][16] will generate a 4x4 block.
- The 8 at position [5][16] will generate a 4x4 block.
- The 8 at position [8][16] will generate a 4x4 block.
- The 8 at position [9][16] will generate a 4x4 block.
- The 8 at position [10][16] will generate a 4x4 block.
- The 2 remains unchanged.

Therefore, the test case's output would look like this after applying the transformation:

```python

It's important to notice that each of these blocks overlaps with the previous one, creating a continuous pattern of 8s in the area where the 8s have been propagated.

3eda0437,"To determine the transformation rule, we need to compare the input and output grids in the provided examples.

First, let's observe the patterns in the examples:

1. The first example shows that color `0` is being replaced with `6` in certain regions of the grid.
2. In all examples, the replacement occurs in contiguous blocks of `0`s that form an enclosed area surrounded by non-zero numbers or grid edges.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Replace isolated regions of `0` with `6`. An isolated region of `0` is defined as a contiguous block of `0`s completely surrounded by non-zero numbers or the edge of the grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case step by step:

1. Identify the regions of `0` that are completely surrounded by non-zero numbers.
2. Replace those `0` regions with `6`.

Applying this rule to the test case:

fafffa47,"To understand the transformation, let's examine the patterns from the training examples:

1. In each transformation, the 9s and 0s are replaced with 0s and 2s, respectively. 
2. It seems the transformation focuses on a 3x3 section in the middle of the upper half of the input grid, possibly considering only the central square and its surrounding squares.
3. There seems to be an inverse relationship between the input grid values (0 and 9) and the output grid values (2 and 0). 
   - 9 becomes 0, and 0 becomes 2 in the output.

Let's apply these observations to the test case grid:

```python

- The 0s become 2s.

a65b410d,"To solve the test case, let's analyze the transformation rule used in the training examples:

1. In all examples, the row and column positions of the number `2` remain unchanged.

2. The `2`s appear to be shifted up and left by new rows filled with the number `3`, followed by decreasing numbers towards `1`. The number of new rows added above the `2`s and the number of columns padded to the left seem to be derived from the width of the block containing the `2`s in the input.

3. The width of the block with `2`s dictates the number of new rows added above:
   - If the block width is 2 (example 1), 3 new rows are added.
   - If the block width is 3 (example 2), 4 new rows are added.
   - If the block width is 4 (example 3), 5 new rows are added.
   
   Therefore, if the block width is `w`, we add `w + 1` new rows above.

4. The rightmost column(s) of these new rows contain higher numbers, which decrease from the top row down to the row just above the original `2`s. 

5. The rest of the cells in the new rows are filled with `0`.

6. The original grid below the `2`s remains mostly unchanged, except that there might be an additional layer of `1`s just below the `2`s depending on the width of the block, followed by zeros filling the remaining space.

Let's apply this to our test case where the block of `2`s has a width of `5`. Following the pattern, we should add `5 + 1 = 6` new rows above the block of `2`s, filling them according to the rules described.

Given the input:
```python

```
We'll create 6 new rows and construct the output grid as follows:

- First row: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]`
- Second row: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]`
- Third row: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Fourth row: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Fifth row: `[3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Sixth row: `[3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Then, the original `2`s remain in place, and below them follows a layer of `1`s and zeros:

- Seventh row (original third row): `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- Eighth row: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

In all the examples, the following procedure seems to apply to transform the input into the output:
1. Identify the largest block of connected cells (horizontally or vertically) with non-zero values.
2. Map this block to a 3x3 grid.

Let's analyze the training examples:
- In Example 1, the largest block of connected cells is the block of 2s and 4s which gets mapped to a 3x3 grid showing mostly 4s.
- In Example 2, the largest block of connected cells is the block of 3s which gets mapped to a 3x3 grid showing mostly 3s.
- In Example 3, the largest block of connected cells is the block of 2s on top, which gets mapped to a 3x3 grid showing mostly 2s.

Applying this understanding to the test case:
The largest block of connected cells in the input is the block of 3s in the bottom-right corner. We map this block to a 3x3 grid, focusing on the largest cluster. Therefore, the output should be a 3x3 grid representing this cluster.

So, the output would consist of 3s, arranged in a manner that represents the largest cluster of 3s in the input.

25d8a9c8,"To find out the transformation rule from the input grids to the output grids, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. In Example 1, the transformation seems to replace all `4`s with `5`s, and everything else with `0`s.
2. In Example 2, the transformation takes the `6`s and transforms them into `5`s, while the rest are changed to `0`s.
3. In Example 3, there is a transformation where `4`s become `5`s, and `9`s also become `5`s; the other cells are `0`s.
4. In Example 4, the pattern is that `1`s are turned into `5`s, and the rest of the cells are `0`s.

From these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves identifying the largest block of any single color in the input grid and replacing all those cells with `5`. All other cells are replaced with `0`.

Applying this transformation rule to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[4, 4, 4],
[3, 2, 3],
[8, 8, 8]]
```

- We identify the largest blocks which are `[4, 4, 4]` and `[8, 8, 8]`, both of which are three cells.
- We choose either one to be transformed into `5`s according to the rule. For consistency, we may choose the first one encountered from top-left to bottom-right, which would be the row of `4`s.
- Then, all the `4`s become `5`s, and all other cells become `0`s.

Therefore, the answer for the test case is:

50cb2852,"To solve the given test case, we need to identify the pattern in the transformations applied to the input grids to produce the output grids.

Analyzing all three provided examples, the transformation rule appears to be:

- Identify groups of consecutive, identical numbers that are not already surrounded by zeros or other borders.
- Replace the interior of these groups with the number 8, while keeping the border intact.

In more detail:
1. For groups of 2s, replace their interior with 8s.
2. For groups of 1s, do the same.
3. Repeat the process for any other numbered groups.

952a094c,"Upon analyzing the transformations from the inputs to the outputs in the given training examples, the following pattern emerges:

1. All non-zero numbers outside the primary shape (which is the central colored region surrounded by zeros) are moved to the top left and bottom right corners of the grid.
2. These numbers are placed in a way that preserves their relative positions with respect to the central shape’s edges.

In Example 1, the numbers `4`, `6`, `3`, and `2` are moved around the shape with `8`s, while in Example 2, the numbers `2`, `3`, `8`, and `9` are similarly manipulated.

For the Test case, the primary shape comprises `3`s and is bordered by `6`, `4`, `8`, and `2`. These numbers should be moved according to the observed pattern:

- `6` and `8` move to the top left corner.
- `4` and `2` move to the bottom right corner.

c3e719e8,"Let's analyze the examples provided to determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids.

In Example 1, the input grid is a 3x3 grid. The output grid appears to be a 9x9 grid, with the original 3x3 pattern repeated in a specific manner.
- First three rows are exactly the same as the input grid followed by six zeros.
- Next three rows are all zeros followed by the input grid.
- Last three rows are identical to the first three rows but shifted horizontally by 6 columns.

Similarly, in Example 2, the input is again a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid with patterns repeated as follows:
- The first three rows copy the input grid, then three zeroes, and finally another copy of the input grid.
- Then, three rows of all zeroes, followed by a copy of the input grid.
- Lastly, the last three rows repeat the input grid pattern, but each row is shifted horizontally by three columns.

Lastly, Example 3 follows the same pattern with variations on where the pattern is repeated:
- Initially, there are three rows with a zero padding on the left side and the input grid pattern to the right side.
- Three rows of all zeroes.
- And the final three rows repeat the input grid pattern.

It appears that the transformation rule involves replicating the 3x3 pattern in a larger 9x9 grid in a specific arrangement, combining direct replication, horizontal padding, and horizontal shifting.

Based on this understanding, let's apply the transformation rule to the test input grid:

```[
[1, 1, 7],
[7, 4, 1],
[5, 1, 7]]
```

Following the observed pattern:
- The first three rows: replicate the input grid three times with two zeroes in between each repetition.
- The next three rows: all zeroes, then the input grid pattern.
- The last three rows: replicate the input grid pattern horizontally shifted by six columns.

Thus, the output will be:

623ea044,"To analyze the transformation rule based on the provided examples, we need to observe the changes in the input grids to their respective output grids.

In Example 1, there is a single non-zero value (2) in the input. In the corresponding output, this value has been distributed along both the diagonals and anti-diagonals of the grid. The same pattern is observed with the value 7 in Example 2. The single non-zero value is placed in a pattern that reflects across both diagonals.

For Example 3, the input has one non-zero value (8), and again in the output, this value is mirrored over the diagonals and anti-diagonals of the smaller grid.

From these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule: for any non-zero value in the input grid, replicate it across all positions symmetrically along the main diagonal and antidiagonal axes.

Applying this rule to the test case, where the non-zero value is 6 at position [8][12], we get:
- Positions on the main diagonal: (x,x)
- Positions on the anti-diagonal: (x,y) where x + y = n-1 (for a grid of size n)

Thus, the output will have '6' at the following positions:
- Row 8, Column 12 (original position)
- Row 7, Column 13
- Row 6, Column 14
- Row 12, Column 7
- Row 13, Column 6
- Row 14, Column 5

2. There are certain positions where a '4' appears in the output grid that didn't exist in the input grid.

1. For any non-zero cell (color), add color code `1` to the cells immediately above and to the left of it, if those cells are currently `0`.

007bbfb7,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grids to their corresponding output grids.

Observation on the transformation:
- Each output grid appears to be a 9x9 grid.
- The transformation seems to involve replicating the original 3x3 grid into a 9x9 grid and rearranging the elements in a specific pattern.
- Each element in the original grid is not just copied but replicated in a 3x3 block in the output grid.
- The structure of the replication follows a consistent pattern across all examples.

Let's break down the replication pattern:
- For each cell [i,j] in the input grid, create a 3x3 block in the output grid at [3*i+k, 3*j+l] where k and l loop through 0 to 2.
- This means each cell's value is repeated in its own 3x3 quadrant in the 9x9 grid.
- Any 0s in the input grid remain as 0s in the output grid, preserving the structure.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to our test case:

017c7c7b,"To determine the transformation rule that applies to the test case, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the provided examples:

1. In all examples, the value 1 in the input grid is consistently replaced with the value 2 in the output grid.
2. The value 0 remains unchanged across all transformations.

Additionally, we observe that the output grid is a duplicated version of the input grid. Specifically, each row of the input grid appears twice in the output grid.

Given these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- Replace every occurrence of 1 with 2 in the original input grid.
- Duplicate each row in the transformed grid.

Applying this rule to the test case:

f25fbde4,"By looking at the examples provided, we can see that the transformation rule involves expanding regions of non-zero values. Each non-zero region is expanded in both dimensions (width and height) until it touches another non-zero region or reaches the border of the transformed grid.

In all provided examples, the resulting grid is smaller than the input grid but contains an expanded version of the original non-zero patterns. To solve the test case, we follow these principles:

1. Identify the regions of non-zero values.
2. Expand each region until they touch other regions or reach the border.

In the given test case, we have a pattern which seems to be a checkerboard of '4's surrounded by zeros. The transformation should expand the areas with '4' and remove the zeros in between until adjacent '4's meet or touch the edge.

### Observations:
1. In each example, the output grid is larger than the input grid.
2. The first column in all example outputs remains constant and is the smallest number present in the respective input grids.
3. The other columns in the output appear to be a rearranged and padded version of the numbers in the input grids.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: 
```
[
[2, 2, 1],
[2, 3, 1],
[1, 1, 1]]
```
- **Output**:
```
[

### Transformation Rule Summary:
- Identify the smallest number in the input grid and use it as the starting number in the output grid.
- Rearrange the remaining numbers such that they are ordered in some form (possibly sorted).
- Pad the grid with zeroes to form a square or rectangular shape larger than or equal to the original grid dimensions.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- **Test Case Input**:
```
[
[8, 8, 2, 2],
[1, 8, 8, 2],
[1, 3, 3, 4],
[1, 1, 1, 1]]
```
- The smallest number in the test case is `1`.
- Unique numbers after `1` are `2`, `3`, `4`, `8`.

Using these observations:
- First column should be `1`s.
- Next columns should have the other numbers in an arranged order, then padded with zeroes.

Thus, the output grid can be constructed as follows:
```
[
[1, 8, 2, 3, 4],  # First row uses the smallest number and the unique ones.
[1, 8, 2, 3, 0],
[1, 8, 2, 0, 0],
[1, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Let's analyze each example:

**Example 1:**
- The color 3 appears on the top left.
- The color 9 appears on the right side.
- The output adds two 3s on the bottom row, one at column 4 and one at column 5.

**Example 2:**
- The color 8 appears on the left and right sides.
- The color 6 appears on the middle row.
- The output adds two 6s, one on the fifth row, second column and one on the sixth row, eighth column.

**Example 3:**
- The color 4 appears on the bottom left, with a 2 inside a square shape.
- The output adds two 2s, one on the fourth row, ninth column and one on the fifth row, first column.

**Example 4:**
- The color 5 appears on the top left and is surrounded by 4s.
- The output adds four 4s, one on the first row, eleventh column; one on the second row, tenth column; one on the third row, ninth column; and one on the fourth row, eighth column.

From these observations, the transformation rule seems to involve:
- Identifying a prominent color or shape.
- Adding copies of that shape or color at specific positions on the grid, often along the borders or in symmetrical positions.

For the **Test Case:**
- Color 3 forms a shape in the middle of the grid.
- Color 4 forms a smaller square within the 3s shape.

- We add 3s on the bottom row, creating symmetry around the existing 3s.

9172f3a0,"To solve the puzzle, let's first analyze the transformation that occurred in the training examples.

In both cases, the transformation can be understood as follows:

1. Each unique non-zero value in the input grid expands to fill a 3x3 square in the output grid.
   - The position of the expanded 3x3 square corresponds to where its original value was located, but spread across a larger area.
   
2. Each zero in the input grid remains zero in the output grid, and fills up 3x3 squares with zeros as well.
 
3. The overall size of the output grid is 3 times the size of the input grid in both dimensions since each cell's value in the input influences a 3x3 square in the output.

Let's apply this transformation rule to the test case.

Given Test Case:
```python
[
[0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 6],
[6, 1, 0]]
```

Following the transformation rules:
- The `1` at (0,1) will expand into a 3x3 square of `1`s at (0-2, 3-5).
- The `6` at (1,2) will expand into a 3x3 square of `6`s at (3-5, 6-8).
- The `6` at (2,0) will expand into a 3x3 square of `6`s at (6-8, 0-2).
- All positions which were `0` in the input will remain `0`.

So, applying these transformations:

```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],  # First row expanded
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],  # Second row expanded
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],  # Third row expanded
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6],  # Fourth row expanded
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6],  # Fifth row expanded
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6],  # Sixth row expanded
[6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],  # Seventh row expanded
[6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],  # Eighth row expanded
[6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]  # Ninth row expanded

6c434453,"To solve the transformation, let's analyze the provided examples and identify any patterns or rules that could be applied.

First, we can observe the following:

1. The transformation appears to involve changing the numbers from `1` to either `0`, `2`, or leaving them as `1`.
2. There seems to be a specific pattern in which cells are changed from `1` to `2`. It looks like `1`s surrounded by other `1`s are kept as `1`s while others are changed to `2`.

Based on these observations, I'll hypothesize the following rules:
1. If a `1` is completely surrounded by other `1`s (i.e., all its direct neighbors are `1`s), it remains `1`.
2. Otherwise, `1`s become `2`.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case

Let's consider the cells with value `1` and check if they are surrounded only by `1`s or not.

    output = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == 1:
                # Check all surrounding cells
                neighbors = [(dr, dc) for dr in (-1, 0, 1) for dc in (-1, 0, 1) if (dr != 0 or dc != 0)]
                if all(0 <= r+dr < rows and 0 <= c+dc < cols and grid[r+dr][c+dc] == 1 for dr, dc in neighbors):
                    output[r][c] = 1
                else:
                    output[r][c] = 2
            else:
                output[r][c] = grid[r][c]

    return output

# Apply the transformation to the test case
output_test = transform(input_test)

Running this code gives us the transformed grid for the test case:

d22278a0,"Based on the provided examples, the transformation rule appears to be as follows:

- For each non-zero number in the input, create a pattern where that number appears repeatedly, alternating with zeros, spreading out from its original position.
- This pattern fills adjacent cells in rows and columns with the same number and zeros, forming a cross pattern around the initial values.
- If there are more than one initial number, they start expanding their patterns separately and might overlap or interleave.

Following these rules, let's apply them to the given test case:

1f642eb9,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the change from the input to output in each example:

In Example 1:
- The value `8` at position `[3, 4]` becomes `9`.
- The value `8` at position `[6, 4]` seems to have changed due to adjacent non-zero numbers.

In Example 2:
- The value `8` at position `[3, 3]` turns into `6`.
- The `8` at position `[3, 5]` turns into `7`.

In Example 3:
- Similarly, the value `8` at position `[3, 3]` changes to `4`.
- The value `8` at position `[7, 4]` changes to `7`.

Observing these patterns, the transformation appears to be based on:
1. The adjacent non-zero numbers to the left or above.
2. If there is a non-zero number adjacent, the cell at the intersection of this number and the column with `8`s gets transformed.

Let's apply this logic to the test case:

Test Case:
- The `9` at `[3, 0]` and `3` at `[5, 0]` and `4` at `[6, 0]` are non-zeros to the left of columns with `8`s.
- For `[3, 3]`, since `9` is above, it should become `9`.
- For `[5, 3]`, `3` is above, so it becomes `3`.
- For `[6, 3]`, `4` is above, so it becomes `4`.
- The `6` at `[0, 3]` would affect `[3, 3]` and `[7, 3]`, but since `[3, 3]` already has a change due to `9`, `[7, 3]` remains unchanged.
- The `2` at `[0, 5]` affects `[3, 5]`, `[5, 5]`, and `[6, 5]`, changing them to `2`.

Thus, our transformed grid looks like this:

ae4f1146,"To identify the transformation rule, let's look at what happens in the transitions from input to output in all the provided training examples:

1. In all cases, the output grid is smaller, specifically 3x3.
2. The output grid appears to be derived from the core of the input grid, with a focus on colors 8 and 1 that seem to form a pattern.

By observing the patterns in each example:

- Example 1's output is the middle 3x3 block of significant colors from its input grid.
- Example 2 and Example 3 follow a similar pattern, capturing the core block where 8s and 1s are concentrated.
- Example 4 also adheres to this pattern, highlighting a condensed view of significant color blocks.

From these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as extracting a significant 3x3 core part of the input grid where colors 8 and 1 predominantly appear.

Applying this rule to the test case, we can derive the 3x3 grid from its center focusing on the prominent colors 8 and 1:

Given the test case input, the most significant part seems to start roughly from row 3 column 3 to row 5 column 5. Extracting those values gives us our output:

a68b268e,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the inputs to produce the outputs, let's analyze the provided examples.

Firstly, observe that all outputs have a dimension of 4x4, which suggests that the transformation involves reducing the size of the input grid to a 4x4 grid. Moreover, the pattern of colors in the output seems to be derived from specific cells in the input grid.

Upon closer inspection, we find that the outputs appear to be composed of colors extracted from four corners or edges of the input grid:
- The first row appears to reflect the colors at the start and end columns of the top row of the input.
- The second row comes from the middle rows of the input.
- The third row also comes from the middle rows.
- The fourth row reflects the colors at the start and end columns of the bottom row of the input.

Let's examine these points in detail:

1. The first column of the output represents the colors from the first column of the input grid.
2. The second column of the output is derived from the middle columns of the input grid.
3. The third column of the output is derived similarly to the second one but may depend on different columns.
4. The fourth column of the output is derived from the last column of the input grid.

Applying these rules to the test case:

The first row of the output should come from the top row of the input:
- First color: `7`
- Second and third colors: `0` (middle columns)
- Last color: `4`

The second row of the output comes from middle rows:
- First color: `7`
- Second and third colors: `4` (middle columns from the middle rows)
- Last color: `0`

The third row of the output is similarly derived:
- First color: `0`
- Second and third colors: `0` (middle columns from the middle rows)
- Last color: `6`

The fourth row of the output comes from the bottom row of the input:
- First color: `0`
- Second and third colors: `6` (middle columns)
- Last color: `0`

Therefore, the output can be constructed as follows:

85c4e7cd,"To determine the transformation applied to the input grids to generate the output grids, let's analyze the transformations in the given examples:

1. **Edge Transformation**:
   - All outer edges (the first and last row and column) change to a unique color that represents the highest color value available (from 1 to 9) in the inner part of the grid (excluding the borders).

2. **Inner Transformation**:
   - Each color inside the grid is replaced by the next highest color in the sequence. If a color reaches 9, it wraps around back to 1.

Let's apply these rules to the test case:

1. **Edge Transformation**:
   - We identify the highest color value within the inner grid (excluding the border). In this case, the highest color is 7.
   - Thus, all border cells should be set to 7.

2. **Inner Transformation**:
   - For each cell that is not on the border:
     - If the cell is 2, it changes to 3.
     - If the cell is 3, it changes to 4.
     - If the cell is 4, it changes to 5.
     - If the cell is 5, it changes to 6.
     - If the cell is 6, it changes to 7.
     - If the cell is 7, it changes to 1.

d06dbe63,"To solve this problem, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids. 

In both training examples, we see a pattern where the color 8 (the only non-zero value in the input grid) remains as is, but additional cells with the color 5 are introduced around it. These cells seem to form a pattern that is symmetrical around the cell with color 8. Let's break down how these patterns are formed.

Example 1 has an 8 at row 3, column 4. In the output, color 5 appears in a specific arrangement surrounding this 8. This suggests that color 8 acts as a 'center' or origin point, and color 5 forms a symmetric pattern around that center.

Example 2 has an 8 at row 7, column 6. The placement of color 5 in the output is similar, forming another symmetric pattern around the 8.

For the test case, the 8 is located at row 5, column 5. Given what we've observed from the previous examples, we can predict the placement of 5s will follow a similar symmetric pattern centered around this 8.

Applying the same logic used in the examples, we can determine the output for the test case.

- In Example 3, the pattern expands. The central cell is 0, and a cross pattern is formed around it. This cross includes cells directly adjacent to the central 0 and extends outward, leaving gaps where cells alternate to 0.

From these observations, we can deduce the rule:
- The central value stays the same.
- We create a cross pattern around the center where every alternate row and column becomes filled with zeros, starting from the immediate surroundings of the central point.

Applying this rule to the test case, which has a central 0 located at the middle of an 11x11 grid:

a78176bb,"To determine the transformation rule applied in the given examples, we need to closely examine the changes made from the input grids to the output grids.

Observations:
1. In Example 1, the first column and row with a 7 are kept intact, but the remaining 7s are moved diagonally down and to the right.
2. In Example 2, the 9 and 5 values are rearranged in a similar diagonal pattern.
3. In Example 3, the pattern of 2s is moved diagonally, while keeping the diagonal sequence maintained.

From these examples, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves moving non-zero elements diagonally down and to the right, with the first column and row generally preserved if they contain the element.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Input:

Following the transformation rule, we move the 1s and 5s diagonally down and to the right, keeping the first appearance of each in place.

Output:

ed36ccf7,"To understand the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes made in the training examples:

1. In Example 1, the number 9 at the top left was changed to 0. The pattern suggests that if there's a single instance of a color surrounded by a different color, that central color changes or remains unchanged based on neighboring elements. However, the rule isn't straightforwardly about single instances but seems to involve larger patterns.

2. In Example 2, the zeros appear to have ""pushed"" the sixes to shift one position to their right. Here, the zeros seem to play a role in shifting the numbers adjacent to them.

3. For Example 3, the central 9s and 0s seem to have switched places. This shows that in some cases, the positions of zeros and other numbers are inverted.

4. In Example 4, zeros again seem to influence the surrounding numbers, pushing them to the right and down, but not strictly in a linear pattern. There appears to be a kind of symmetry or mirror effect around the zeros.

Putting together these observations, especially focusing on the movement and positioning of zeros relative to other numbers, it seems like the zeros act as a kind of 'mirror' or 'pivot', affecting the arrangement of numbers around them. They don't just push but also rearrange the numbers in a symmetrical fashion, potentially flipping or rotating the pattern.

Given this understanding, here’s how we can apply the transformation rule to the test case:

``` 
Test Input:
[
[0, 0, 0],
[5, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 5]]
```

Following the pattern observed:
- The top row and first column of zeros suggest that the numbers should reflect symmetrically across these zero areas.
- The 5s should be mirrored such that they appear more towards the bottom right, considering the zero acts as a pivot point for reflection.

Therefore, the expected output should be:

``` 
Test Output:
[
[5, 5, 5],
[5, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0]]
```

This maintains the symmetry with zeros acting as pivots and reflects the numbers across these points in a manner similar to the previous examples.

72ca375d,"To find the pattern in the transformations, let's observe the patterns in the provided training examples:

1. The output grids are smaller than the input grids.
2. The output grids contain only the largest contiguous block of non-zero numbers, without any zeros inside them (but zeros can surround them).
3. The position of the largest block relative to the edge is not considered; only the shape and color of the largest block matter.

Let's apply these observations to each example:

**Example 1**
In the input, the largest contiguous block of non-zero numbers is the 7s. However, the 7s are also surrounded by 0s and not completely enclosed. In the output, the largest block of non-zero is actually the 6s which form a 4x2 block.

**Example 2**
In the input, there are two blocks of non-zero numbers: 4s and 8s. The 8s form a larger contiguous block but the output contains the 4s which form a 2x2 block. This indicates that the output might choose the block based on the first occurrence or some other criteria.

**Example 3**
The largest contiguous block of non-zero numbers in the input is the 5s that form a 4x4 block.

For the test case:
- The input has several blocks of non-zero numbers: a 3s block, a 9s block, and a 4s block.
- The 9s block forms a 5x4 block, the 3s block forms a 4x3 block, and the 4s block forms a 5x3 block. 

Among these, we consider the largest contiguous block of non-zero numbers excluding zeros inside them. Hence, the 9s block is the largest one.

Applying the transformation rule observed in the training examples, we extract the largest continuous block:

b230c067,"To solve the puzzle, let's analyze the pattern from the training examples:

1. Each instance where an `8` appears in the input gets transformed into either a `1` or a `2` in the output.
2. Clusters of `8`s seem to be replaced with the same number (`1` or `2`) within each group. In other words, if `8`s form a connected region (with adjacency defined by side or corner), they all get the same number.
3. Different clusters of `8`s are assigned different numbers. There seems to be a pattern in which the first cluster found (from left to right or top to bottom) is assigned `1`, and subsequent clusters are assigned `2`.

Using this rule, let's transform the test case input.

Input:

```

Following the observed rules:
- The first connected group of `8`s (top-left) will be replaced by `1`.
- The second connected group of `8`s (middle-right) will be replaced by `2`.
- The third group (bottom-left) will also be `2` since it is another separate group.

e76a88a6,"From the provided examples, it is evident that the transformation rule is related to swapping the color blocks located on opposite sides of the grid while maintaining their shapes and relative positions.

In Example 1, the block with color `5` in the middle-right area of the grid is swapped with a new `2, 4, 4` block structure on the left side of the grid, which originally had colors `2` and `4` but in a different configuration.

Similarly, in Example 2, the right-side block with color `5` is swapped with the left-side block with colors `6`, `8`. The shapes and internal structures of the blocks are preserved, but they switch places within the grid.

Applying this transformation rule to the test case:

- The left `1`s and `4`s block will move to where the right `5`s block is.
- The right `5`s block will move to where the left `1`s and `4`s block is.

In both examples, there's a transformation applied to the grid that seems to add a pattern of number 7s around certain areas where the number 4 already exists. Specifically, 7s appear in locations adjacent to 4s but not directly touching another 4.

Let's look at Example 1:
- In row 2, column 3, a 7 appears because it's surrounded on two sides by 4s.
- In row 3, columns 1 and 3, 7s appear similarly.
- In row 4, column 1, a 7 appears because it's adjacent to a 4 horizontally.
- In row 5, column 8, and in rows 6 and 7, columns 6 and 8, 7s appear in spaces adjacent to 4s but not directly touching another 4.

The same principle is observed in Example 2:
- In row 3, column 1, a 7 appears due to its adjacency to more than one 4.
- In row 6, columns 6 and 8, and in row 7, column 8, 7s appear similarly.

Given these observations, we can conclude that 7s are placed in areas that are directly adjacent to existing 4s, but only if they're not directly touching another 4.

Now, let's apply these rules to the test case:

```python

Applying the transformation:
- Row 2, column 5 should have a 7.
- Row 3, columns 2 and 4 should have 7s.
- Row 4, column 2 should have a 7.
- Row 7, column 6 should have a 7.

67e8384a,"To understand the transformation rule applied in the examples, let's break down the differences between the input and output grids:

1. **Size Increase:** In each example, the output grid is larger than the input grid. Specifically, the dimensions of the output grid are doubled in both directions. For example, if the input grid is 3x3, the output grid becomes 6x6.

2. **Symmetry Across Central Axis:** The output grid exhibits symmetry around its central axis, both horizontally and vertically.
    - The left side of the output grid mirrors the right side.
    - The top half of the output grid mirrors the bottom half.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- Double the size of the input grid by repeating each row and column.
- Ensure the resulting grid is symmetric around both horizontal and vertical midlines.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```python
[
[1, 6, 6],
[5, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2]]
```

**Step-by-step Transformation:**
- Start with the input grid.
- Duplicate rows and columns to form a 6x6 grid.
- Ensure symmetry along both axes.

Following the rule, we first duplicate the rows:

```python
[
[1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6],
[5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
]
```

Next, mirror the above grid along the vertical axis to achieve symmetry:

```python
[
[1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6],
[5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
[5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2],
[1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6]
]
```

This grid already satisfies both the horizontal and vertical symmetry.

The final transformed grid is:

Answer: ```[[1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6], [5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2], [1, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6]]```","[[1 6 6 1 6 6]

e8dc4411,"To solve this puzzle, we need to observe the transformation applied in each of the training examples. In all three examples, the transformation rule involves spreading a specific color value (e.g., 2, 3, or 8) from an initial position where it was present in the input grid to other positions in a patterned manner.

From the examples:
- **Example 1**: Color `2` spreads out from the position (5,6) in a cross-like pattern.
- **Example 2**: Color `3` spreads out from the positions (7,4) and (7,6) in a similar cross-like pattern.
- **Example 3**: Color `8` spreads out from the position (4,11) in a cross-like pattern.

The patterns involve coloring cells horizontally and vertically from the initial points, creating a cross shape across the grid. Let's apply this understanding to the test case:

In the test case, the color `0` appears at several points: (6,4), (6,6), (8,4), and (8,6). These zeros should serve as starting points for a similar cross-like spread.

Here's my step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the positions of `0` in the test case.
2. Spread horizontally and vertically from these positions.
3. Maintain the original color (`3`) where there are no initial `0` positions.

Following this logic, here is the solution:

3428a4f5,"To understand the transformation rule, let's compare the input and output grids in the training examples.

1. The central row with all 4s is removed in all examples.
2. For the remaining rows, a color transformation seems to occur where certain patterns of 2s and 0s are changed into a pattern using 3s and 0s.
3. Specifically, the transformation appears to replace all 2s with 3s except when they form a block of 2s that spans the entire row or column. In such cases, those 2s remain 2s after the transformation.

Let's apply these rules to the test case:

- Remove the central row of all 4s.
- Replace every 2 with a 3 except for blocks spanning an entire row or column.

ef135b50,"First, let's analyze the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids. Observations from the provided examples:

1. The transformation seems to focus on areas that are enclosed by the color `2`. 
2. These enclosed areas get filled with the number `9`.
3. Areas not completely enclosed by `2` or connected to the boundary of the grid remain unchanged.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- In Example 1, the areas in columns 3 to 6 rows 3 to 5 and column 6 rows 6 to 7 are surrounded by the color `2`, so they are replaced by `9`.
- In Example 2, the area in columns 2 to 7 row 2, and column 5 rows 5 to 7 is also surrounded by `2`, therefore filled with `9`.
- In Example 3, the area in column 4 row 2 and column 9 rows 6 to 8 are similarly treated.

Applying the same logic to the Test case:
- We need to identify all regions where the color `2` surrounds the area without leaving any gaps or touching the edge.
- From our test case, the region in column 3 to 5 rows 1 to 4 and column 5 rows 5 and 6 fits this description.

99b1bc43,"To determine the transformation rule from the given examples, let's analyze the differences between the inputs and outputs:

1. The output grids are smaller in size compared to the input grids.
2. The input grids have a middle row of all `4`s which seems to separate the upper and lower parts. This middle row does not appear in the output.
3. In the outputs, the value `3` replaces some values from the original grids, while `0` is used where there was no change or where there was originally `0`.
4. Observing the pattern, it looks like the output is derived only from the top left portion of the input (above the row of `4`s) and sometimes the bottom part affects the top part in the output.

Let's break it down further with the examples provided:

- The top-left quadrant (up to the middle `4`s row) of the input grid is considered.
- Certain patterns (like `1` and `0`) in the input grid are replaced by `3` in the output grid.
- The bottom part (below the `4`s) seems to reflect back onto the top part in a mirrored fashion, and possibly influences the placement of `3` in the top part.

Given these observations, we can deduce that:
- The output grid size is half the height of the input grid minus one (due to the middle `4`s row).
- The transformation involves replacing certain patterns (e.g., `1` and `0`) above the middle `4`s row with `3` in the output, and the bottom part influences this transformation.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:

Input:
```
[
[1, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 1, 1],
[0, 0, 1, 0],
[1, 0, 1, 1],
[4, 4, 4, 4],
[2, 2, 0, 2],
[0, 0, 2, 0],
[2, 0, 0, 2],
[0, 2, 0, 2]]
```

The top left quadrant up to the 4s row is:
```
[
[1, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 1, 1],
[0, 0, 1, 0],
[1, 0, 1, 1]
]
```

And the bottom part is:
```
[
[2, 2, 0, 2],
[0, 0, 2, 0],
[2, 0, 0, 2],
[0, 2, 0, 2]

```

Combining the patterns as per the observed transformation rules, the output should be:
```
[
[3, 0, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 3, 3, 0]
]
```

So the answer to the test case is:

bc1d5164,"Analyzing the transformation patterns:

1. The first thing to notice is that the output grid sizes are much smaller than the input grid sizes, indicating some form of compression or reduction.

2. Upon close inspection, it's evident the output grids retain only certain columns and rows from the input, with the middle part being retained and the outer edges being discarded.

3. Observing Example 1's input and output:
   - Original:  
     ```
     [
       [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
       [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Output: 
     ```
     [
       [0, 8, 0],
       [8, 8, 8],
       [0, 8, 0]
     ]
     ```
   Notice the pattern in the input where the outermost columns and rows are trimmed off, leaving the center with the significant color patterns still intact.

4. For Example 2, the same pattern applies:
   - Original:
     ```
     [
       [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
       [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
       [2, 2, 2],
       [0, 2, 2],
       [2, 0, 2]
     ]
     ```

We can follow this logic for all the other examples and see that the core pattern remains consistent.

Given this understanding, I will apply the same transformation to the test case:

Test input:
```
[

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

1. **Pattern Identification**:
   - In the outputs, where there was originally a `1` in the input grid, a new sequence `[7, 1, 6]` or `[2, 8]` appears around that position.
   - The sequence seems to be applied in a circular manner around the original `1`.

2. **Sequence Analysis**:
   - The sequence `[7, 1, 6]` or `[2, 8]` is used to fill cells adjacent to the cell with the original `1`.
   - Adjacent cells refer to cells directly above, below, left, right, and diagonally.

3. **Rule Deduction**:
   - For each `1` present in the input, generate a circular pattern around it using the sequences `[7, 1, 6]` and `[2, 8]`.
   - Each sequence seems to propagate outward in a spiral fashion.

2. Example 2 follows the same rules where 3, 1, and 2 are used. Here, the color 3 appears twice, one instance filling its row and the other filling its column, and the other colors follow similar propagation patterns.

3. For example 3, color 1 in the second row propagates across the entire row, similarly, colors 2 and 3 fill their respective columns and rows as necessary.

Based on the analysis, the transformation rule appears to be that each non-zero color found in the grid should propagate to fill its row if the color is found in any cell of that row, or fill its column if the color is found in any cell of that column.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- The number 3 in the first row and fourth column should fill the first row and fourth column.
- The number 2 in the ninth column and second row should fill the ninth column and second row.
- The number 3 in the fifth row and sixth column should fill the fifth row and sixth column.
- The number 2 in the sixth row and fifth column should fill the sixth row and fifth column.
- The number 1 in the eighth row should fill the entire eighth row.
- The number 1 in the tenth row and ninth column should fill the tenth row and ninth column.

Putting all these transformations together, the resulting transformed grid will look like:

```python
[
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2],
[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2],

6855a6e4,"Upon analyzing the transformations in the training examples, there seems to be a pattern: The color represented as '5' seems to move vertically downward while preserving its horizontal alignment and shape. It also appears that color '5' is removed if it overlaps with color '2'.

Let's break down the transformation:

1. For any row containing '5', shift all '5's one row down.
2. If shifting '5' would cause overlap with '2', remove the '5'.
3. Repeat the above steps until no more shifts or removals can be done.

Observations from Training Examples:

- The overall dimensions of the input and output grids match.
- There appears to be a rotation or rearrangement of elements.
- In Example 1, the first column and last column seem swapped.
- In Example 2, the first and last columns also appear swapped.
- In Example 3, similar swapping of the first and last columns can be observed.

Hypothesis:
The transformation rule seems to be that we swap the first and last columns of the grid. Let us test this hypothesis on the given test case.

Test Case:
Input Grid:
```[
[7, 6, 1],
[6, 7, 6],
[6, 2, 2]]
```

Applying the hypothesis (swap the first and last columns):
```[
[1, 6, 7],
[6, 7, 6],
[2, 2, 6]]

445eab21,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the pattern in the provided examples.

In all examples, we observe that the output is a 2x2 grid composed of the color at the center of the largest block of non-zero contiguous cells in the input grid. This central block is the one that is not surrounded by smaller or equal-sized blocks with different colors.

- Example 1: The largest contiguous block is the one with color `7` in the top left corner, and the next one with color `8` below it. The central part of the block with `8` forms the output.
- Example 2: The largest contiguous block is the one with color `7` in the bottom center. Its central part forms the output.
- Example 3: The largest contiguous block is the one with color `4` in the top center. Its central part forms the output.

So the rule appears to be selecting the central 2x2 part of the largest central contiguous block of non-zero cells from the input grid.

For the test case:

The largest contiguous block of non-zero cells consists of `9`s at the right side of the grid. We can derive the 2x2 central part of these `9`s.

6d0160f0,"Upon carefully analyzing the given examples, we can deduce that the transformation rule applied to each input grid to obtain the output grid is as follows:

1. **Pattern Identification**: Each grid has rows with the number `5` running through them, which seems to act as a boundary or separator. The pattern involves modifying numbers around these `5`s.

2. **Transformation Rule**: It appears that all digits except `5` are replaced with `0`, except for those which are directly adjacent to a `5`. Any digit adjacent to `5` is retained, but only if the adjacent position is not also `5`.

Let's apply this rule to the Test input grid:

- Scan the entire grid.
- For every cell, if the value is not `5`, check its vertical and horizontal neighbors.
- If any neighbor is `5` and the current cell is not `5`, retain the value; otherwise, set it to `0`.

d43fd935,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes from the input to output in the training examples:

1. **Color Expansion:** In all three examples, there seems to be an expansion or filling in of certain colors based on their adjacency. For example, in Example 1, some `1` and `6` values spread across rows and columns that contain them, but not outside the clusters or regions where they appear.

2. **Cluster Filling:** In Example 2, we can see that the `7` and `8` values expand to fill spaces within their own clusters but don't spill over into other clusters.

3. **Preservation of Isolated Values:** In Example 3, the `1` value expands vertically downward until it hits another color.

Given these observations, let's apply the transformation rule to the test case.

### Test Case Analysis:
- The `2` values should expand horizontally and vertically within their own clusters.
- The `6` values should also expand similarly.
- The `3` values stay confined within their own cluster.

Applying these rules to the test input:

```python
[
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],         # 2 spreads
    [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],         # 2 spreads
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],         # 2 spreads
    [6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],         # 6 spreads
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],         # 6 spreads
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],         # 2 spreads
    [6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],         # 3 stays
    [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],         # 3 stays

228f6490,"To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes that happen in each training example from input to output.

First observation: certain areas of color are replaced with another color or removed entirely. We can see that blocks of the same color are not necessarily contiguous, but they seem to be part of a single region if connected by the same color.

Second observation: The transformation seems to selectively remove or replace color regions based on their adjacency to other colors. For instance, in Example 1, the block of '6's is removed and replaced with '0's, while in Example 2, a block of '3's replaces a block of '0's.

With these observations, we apply these principles to the test case:

The pattern suggests that any non-zero color region that isn't surrounded or backed by another non-zero color on all sides will be replaced with '0's. In other words, only regions that are completely enclosed by other non-zero colors remain unchanged.

Using this rule, we can deduce the output for the test case.

Test Case Analysis:
- The '2' in the middle of the top row has no non-zero neighbors and should be changed to '0'.
- The '5's form a large central area that is somewhat enclosed by '2', '4', and '7's; however, some parts are exposed and should be turned into '0's.
- The '4's at the top right are only touching one side with '5's and should be turned into '0's.
- The '7's on the left side are partially exposed and some parts should be turned into '0's.
- The '5's at the bottom are completely enclosed by '2's and '5's, so they should stay as '5's.

Based on these rules, here is the output for the test case:

22eb0ac0,"To solve this puzzle, let's try to understand the transformation rules based on the provided training examples.

**Observations:**
- In the first example, the row with the value `4` at both ends was filled with `4`.
- In the second example, the rows with identical values at both ends (`8` and `1`) were filled with that value across the entire row.
- In the third example, there were no rows that had identical values at both ends except for the top and bottom edges which have only zeros, so no changes occurred.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

- If a row has the same non-zero value at both its first and last positions, fill the entire row with that value.
- Otherwise, do not change the row.

Applying this logic to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```

[9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]
```

The rows that match the condition are the 4th row (values `3` at both ends) and the 8th row (values `6` at both ends). So, we would fill these rows with their respective values, leaving all other rows unchanged.

Therefore, the answer should be:

5168d44c,"To derive the transformation rule applied to the input grids to generate the output grids, let's analyze how the first few elements in the input grids are altered.

Upon comparing the input and output grids provided in the examples, we can infer that the transformation rule involves rotating blocks composed of non-zero elements around their center points to a new position. Specifically, the pattern seems to involve shifting the blocks one position up while wrapping the top row to the bottom if necessary.

For instance, in Example 1, the block with colors 2 and 3 was moved up one row, leaving empty space at the bottom. Similarly, in Example 2, the middle section containing the 2's and 3's was shifted upwards, pushing non-zero elements that were already at the top to the bottom.

Applying this rule to the Test case:

The test case has a similar structure, with a pattern of 2's and 3's in the middle rows. Following the pattern of shifting everything up by one row and wrapping the top elements to the bottom, we get:

```python

dbc1a6ce,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in each example.

1. **Identifying the pattern**:
    - In all examples, the number `8` appears where there are spaces between the `1`s that need to be connected or filled to create a continuous path of `1`s (or isolated groups of `1`s).
    - This suggests a filling operation where `8` serves as a placeholder to connect or surround existing `1`s, forming a sort of boundary or path.

2. **Application of the rule**:
    - The `8`s fill areas that are directly adjacent to the `1`s and separate them into distinct clusters. The filling stops at the boundaries of these clusters.
    - If a `1` is isolated, no change occurs. However, if `1`s are in close proximity but separated by zeros, the zeros between them get replaced by `8`s.

Based on this analysis, we can apply the same logic to the test case:

- Identify clusters of `1`.
- Fill with `8` directly adjacent to `1`s to form continuous paths or boundaries around these clusters.

22233c11,"To identify the transformation rules applied to the input grids to produce the output grids, let's analyze the provided examples.

The transformation seems to occur in two primary ways:

1. **Color 8 Insertion**: Color 8 appears in positions that seem to be at the boundary or just outside the cluster of color 3. These spots are typically where a new ""color 8"" can be placed without overlapping with existing color 3s or other color 8s.
2. **Pattern**: The placement of color 8 around the clusters of color 3 follows a pattern. It appears at the extreme left, right, top, and bottom edges just outside the cluster of color 3s, but only if there isn't another color 8 there already.

Let's apply these insights to the test case:

In the test case, we have a larger and differently arranged cluster of color 3s. We need to place color 8 around this cluster according to the observed pattern.

- The cluster of color 3s is in the center of the grid.
- We need to place color 8 around this cluster on the boundaries that don't overlap with the color 3s or other color 8s.

41e4d17e,"To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output of the examples provided.

Observations from Example 1:
- The color `8` forms a boundary around blocks of other colors.
- The color `1` represents the original shape.
- The new color `6` is added in certain areas that seem to fill up gaps or extend from the `1` blocks but not entirely replacing `1`.

Observations from Example 2:
- The pattern is repeated. Gaps appear filled with `6` within the `1` blocks while maintaining the integrity of the outer `8` boundary.

In both examples, the color `6` appears in rows and columns where there was previously only `8`, suggesting it fills gaps and extends from existing figures formed by `1`s, without changing the `1` itself.

For the test case, I'll apply the same logic:
- Identify the `1` blocks and their patterns.
- Determine where `6` should be placed based on extending these patterns without disrupting the `1` blocks.

Applying the rule to the test case:

48d8fb45,"To derive the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Observation:** In all examples, the output grids are smaller than the input grids.
2. **Pattern:** Let's consider how the output grids are formed. Each value in the output seems to be the maximum value found in a particular 3x3 block of the input grid (if that block contains non-zero values). If all the values in a certain 3x3 block are zero, the corresponding output cell is also zero.

**Examples analysis:**
- Example 1: The output `[ [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1] ]` suggests that the first row of the output is derived from the top-left 3x3 blocks of the input grid, where the largest non-zero value is taken.
- Example 2: `[ [4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 4], [0, 4, 0] ]`, here the values correspond to the maximum non-zero value found in each 3x3 block of the input.
- Example 3: `[ [0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0] ]`, again, the maximum non-zero values from the corresponding 3x3 blocks of the input grid.

Using these observations, we process the test case similarly by breaking down the test case into 3x3 blocks and finding the maximum non-zero value within each block.

**Test Case Breakdown:**
- Top-left 3x3 block: All zeros -> Output cell: `0`
- Middle-left 3x3 block: Max value `3` -> Output cell: `3`
- Bottom-left 3x3 block: Max value `3` -> Output cell: `3`
- Top-middle 3x3 block: Max value `3` -> Output cell: `3`
- Middle-middle 3x3 block: Max value `3` -> Output cell: `3`
- Bottom-middle 3x3 block: Max value `3` -> Output cell: `3`
- Top-right 3x3 block: Max value `5` -> Output cell: `5`
- Middle-right 3x3 block: Max value `3` -> Output cell: `3`
- Bottom-right 3x3 block: All zeros -> Output cell: `0`

Putting it together, the output grid would be:
```python
[
[0, 3, 5],
[3, 3, 3],
[3, 3, 0]

7ddcd7ec,"Based on the given examples, we can infer the transformation rule that is applied to the input grids to generate the output grids. The rule appears to be as follows:

1. Identify the largest cluster of colored cells (non-zero cells) in the grid.
2. For every non-zero cell outside the largest cluster, move it diagonally towards the bottom-right corner until its movement would cause it to leave the grid or encounter an existing non-zero cell. Once a cell reaches its new position, it remains there, and no further diagonal moves are performed.

With these rules in mind, let's apply them to the test case provided:

Test Case Input:
```python
[
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

The largest cluster of colored cells is located around the position (5, 4) to (5, 6) (0-indexed), which includes the cells (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), and (6, 2).

The isolated '8' at position (3, 5) will move diagonally towards the bottom-right corner until it stops at the edge of the grid or encounters another cell. This cell will move to position (9, 9) since there are no obstacles.

Thus, the Test Output should look like this:

760b3cac,"To solve this problem, first let's analyze the changes from input to output in the provided examples.

The examples show that the transformation involves the color `8`. For every occurrence of `8` in an input grid, the positions adjacent to it (horizontally and vertically) are filled with `8` if they were previously `0`, unless filling them would lead to a larger contiguous block (which appears to be avoided).

In Example 1:
- In the top row, there are `8`s at the fourth and sixth columns. The zeros around the `8`s are replaced with `8`s.
- In the second row, the `8`s at the fifth and sixth columns cause the surrounding zeros to become `8`.

In Example 2:
- Similarly, the `8`s fill in surrounding zeros, but it avoids creating a large solid block. Note how the `8`s only extend to the edges where necessary, not filling up all surrounding spaces.

In Example 3:
- Again, the `8`s fill in surrounding zeros in a way that does not create large contiguous blocks. It fills in just enough to make a pattern without making the `8` section too broad.

Applying these observations to the test case:

1. The `8` in the first row at the fourth column should cause the surrounding zeros to be filled with `8`.
2. The `8` in the same row at the sixth column should also fill the surrounding zeros.
3. This process repeats for the second row at the fifth and sixth columns.
4. The `8` in the third row at the fourth column should also fill in the surrounding zeros.

Based on this analysis, here is the transformed test case grid:

```python
Answer: [[0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
         [8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],

         [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

36d67576,"To derive the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes observed in the provided examples:

In all three training examples, the patterns of changes are as follows:
1. Numbers (colors) seem to move or replicate into neighboring cells, especially towards the right.
2. Some numbers appear to 'spread' or 'fill' adjacent empty cells (cells with value `0`).
3. Certain numbers also appear to 'shift' or 'migrate' towards specific directions while maintaining their pattern.

Based on these observations, we can infer the rules as:
- If a cell contains a number that isn't `0`, it tries to spread to an adjacent cell to its right if it's empty (`0`). This spreading behavior seems to prefer staying within the same row but can cross rows under certain conditions.
- The spreading also involves a shift or migration of numbers within a defined 'pattern', which could include replication across rows when specific conditions are met.

Let's apply this inferred transformation rule to the test case:

68b16354,"To transform the input into the output, let's observe the patterns in the training examples:

1. Comparing Example 1:
- The output grid is a reversed version of the input grid, flipping all rows.

2. Comparing Example 2:
- The output grid is also a reversed version of the input grid, flipping all rows.

3. Comparing Example 3:
- Again, the output grid is a reversed version of the input grid, with the rows flipped up to down.

Hence, we can infer that the transformation rule applied here is to reverse the order of the rows in the grid.

- For any square enclosed by a solid border of the number `5`, except for the squares that touch the border of the grid or the squares directly outside another solid border of `5`s, those enclosed squares turn into `2`s.

Let's analyze the test case based on this rule:

Original Test Case:
```[

[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]
```

The top-left block of `5`s touches the border of the grid, so no change there. The bottom-right block of `5`s also touches the grid border, hence it remains unchanged too.

So, the transformed Test Case should remain the same since there are no enclosed regions of zeros surrounded by `5`s that aren't touching the edge of the grid.

In Example 1:
Input:

]
```
Output:
```

In Example 2:

Output:

From these examples, we observe that the output is a reflection of the input grid along its main diagonal (from the top-left to bottom-right corner). This is known as the transpose operation.

Let's apply the transpose operation to the test case input grid:

Test Input:
```

When transposing this grid, we get:

d037b0a7,"To find the solution to the test case, I'll examine the patterns in the three training examples.

In Example 1, the first column contains `0, 0, 3`, the second column has `0, 4, 0`, and the third column has `6, 0, 0`. The output fills the empty cells with the value of the non-zero cell in the row or above it. That is, the `0` in the third column's second row becomes `6` (same column's upper non-zero value). Similarly, the third row gets `3` in the second column and `6` in the third column.

In Example 2, the column patterns are: `0, 7, 0`, `2, 0, 0`, and `0, 8, 0`. The output fills the bottom two rows with `7` and `2` since that's the first non-zero value found going up in their respective columns. The third column retains `8`.

In Example 3, the columns are `4, 0, 0`, `0, 2, 0`, and `0, 0, 0`. The output applies similar logic, filling the second row with `4` in the first column and `2` in the second column. The third row gets `4` in the first column and `2` in the second column. The third column remains all zeros.

Based on these observations, the pattern applied appears to fill any `0` with the nearest non-zero value above it in the same column if there is one. If not, the `0` stays `0`.

For the test case:
Input:
```[
[4, 0, 8],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 7, 0]]
```

Following the observed pattern:
- First column: `0`s in rows 2 and 3 get filled with `4`.
- Second column: `0`s in rows 1 and 2 get filled with `7`.
- Third column: `0`s in rows 2 and 3 retain their values as they have no non-zero value above them.

Thus, the output should be:

e179c5f4,"To solve the test case, let's analyze the transformation rules based on the provided examples:

1. The grids have an initial pattern where most cells contain `0`s and a single cell towards the bottom contains `1` along with `0`s.
2. In the transformation to the output grid, a specific pattern emerges with alternating `8`s and `1`s in the first column, starting with `8`.
3. As the columns increase, the pattern of alternating `8`s and `1`s spreads across the other columns, with `8`s filling the spaces not occupied by `1` in such a way that only one `1` per row is present.
4. From the examples, it is clear that the `1` moves one column to the right with each additional column in the grid, while the `8` fills up the remaining spots.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following steps for transforming any given input grid:
- Start at the leftmost column and fill the space with a pattern of alternating `8`s and `1`s, starting with `8` in the first row.
- For each additional column, shift the position of `1` to the right by one column.
- Fill the rest of the row with `8`s.

Applying these rules to our test case, we get the following output grid:

In both examples, there's one non-zero value in the input grid that gets used to fill a certain pattern in the output grid.

1. The first non-zero number encountered (from top to bottom, left to right) is used to fill the corners of the grid with its value.
2. Then, the second non-zero number encountered is used to fill the remaining corners and edges with its value.
3. Finally, all other parts of the grid are filled with zeros except for the edges and corners which have been colored with the above-mentioned numbers.

For the test case:
```

- The remaining cells at the center will be filled with 8.

For Example 1, the clusters are:

- `2`s form another cluster:

- `3`s form the last cluster:

ac0a08a4,"To identify the transformation rule, let's examine the changes from the inputs to the outputs in the training examples provided.

### Observations:

1. **Expansion**: Each color cell in the input grid expands horizontally and vertically into a block of cells with the same color. This expansion seems to fill out the entire new grid.
   
2. **Pattern**: In each case, the new grid is larger than the original grid. The number of rows and columns in the resulting grid appears to be equal to the sum of the row and column indices where the non-zero numbers appear.

3. **Placement of Colors**: 
    - For the first non-zero value in the top row or left column, a block is created extending to the right and down until the next non-zero value's starting point.
    - For the subsequent non-zero values, their blocks extend similarly but start from their original position in the input grid.

### Rules Identified:
- The size of the output grid is determined by the total number of rows and columns needed to place all color blocks fully.
- Each non-zero value in the input grid transforms into a block expanding equally in both horizontal and vertical directions.
- The placement of these blocks is based on the original position of non-zero values in the input grid.
  
### Applying the Rule to Test Case:

Let's apply this to the test case:
Input:
```[
[1, 0, 0],
[0, 9, 6],
[8, 0, 0]]
```

1. The value `1` at index `[0][0]` should expand to fill a 3x3 block.
2. The value `9` at index `[1][1]` should expand to fill a 3x3 block starting at its original position.
3. The value `6` at index `[1][2]` should expand to fill a 3x3 block starting at its original position.
4. The value `8` at index `[2][0]` should expand to fill a 3x3 block starting at its original position.

The size of the output grid will be 5x5 because we need to fit all blocks without overlap.

Following the above logic, constructing the expanded grid would yield:
```[
[1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
[0, 9, 9, 6, 6],
[0, 9, 9, 6, 6]
]```
This configuration ensures that each non-zero value fills its respective block without overlapping with others.

- This filling process appears to involve creating a vertical column of `3`s directly under any `1`, extending upwards until hitting a boundary or an already filled-in `3`.

**Example Analysis:**

- In Example 1, we have two `1`s. The one in the middle row has three `3`s above it, which indicates that the transformation rule is to fill upwards until the top edge.
- Similarly, in Example 2, the `1` in the first row leads to three `3`s below it filling downwards, creating a vertical column of `3`s.

Based on the pattern observed, the transformation seems to be:
1. Identify any `1` in the grid.
2. For each `1`, replace the cells directly above or below it with `3`, forming a vertical line of `3`s until the grid boundary is reached.

**Applying the Rule to the Test Case:**
- The test case has two `1`s located in the fourth row, at the second column and the twelfth column.

Following the identified transformation rule:
- The `1` at position (4, 1) should result in a column of `3`s extending upwards from row 4 to the top of the grid (rows 1 to 4).
- Similarly, the `1` at position (4, 11) should also result in a column of `3`s extending upwards from row 4 to the top of the grid (rows 1 to 4).

The resulting output after applying the transformation would look as follows:

```python
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],

d687bc17,"Upon analyzing the transformations from the input to output grids in the training examples, one can identify a pattern involving the propagation of certain color values from the edges towards the center of the grid.

Here's the detailed transformation process observed:

1. **Edge Color Propagation:** Colors on the edges seem to spread inward. Specifically, the colors that appear at the extreme ends of rows or columns propagate into the blank spaces (values of zero) around them.
   
2. **Color Overlap Resolution:** When two different colors meet (from opposite directions), the value seems to favor the first-encountered edge color when scanning the grid from the outside-in.

Applying these rules to the given Test case, we start by examining the extreme ends of rows and columns and then propagate their colors inward.

b94a9452,"To solve the test case, we need to understand the pattern in the transformations of the previous examples:

1. **Identify the Core Pattern**:
    - The output grids consist of the inner core of the non-zero patterns in the input grids.
    - The center of the pattern in the input is expanded into a square or rectangle that fully encompasses the non-zero elements, with the highest value filling the outer boundaries.

2. **Detailed Process**:
    - In each training example, identify the smallest rectangle enclosing all non-zero elements.
    - Replace all the border elements of this rectangle with the largest non-zero element present in the enclosed area.
    - The inner part of this rectangle remains unchanged, but cropped down to the smallest size necessary to contain the original pattern.

3. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**:
    - Locate the smallest rectangle covering all non-zero elements in the test case.
    - The rectangle identified contains the numbers 3 and 8. The largest number within this rectangle is 8.
    - Expand the borders of this rectangle with 8s, keeping the inner pattern as it is but cropped to the tightest fit.

Given these steps, the test case's inner pattern is identified as:
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3 3
3 3 8 8 3 3
3 3 8 8 3 3
3 3 3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3 3
```

The transformation according to the observed rules would make the outer borders 8s and crop the inner pattern to a compact form. Hence, the final output should be:

```python
[[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
 [8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8],

6430c8c4,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids, I will analyze the provided training examples:

1. **Observation**: Each output grid has a size of 4x4.
2. **Pattern**: The color `7` in the input seems to correspond to `3` in the output, and almost all other elements are `0` except for those specific patterns formed by `7`.
3. **Rule Identification**: It appears that the output grid is constructed based on the presence or absence of `7`s in certain positions of the input grid. Specifically, if a `7` is present in particular locations in the input, those locations are marked with a `3` in the output.

Analyzing the examples:

- In Example 1, a `7` at position `[0][0]` results in a `3` at `[0][0]`, and a `7` at `[1][1]` results in a `3` at `[1][0]`.
- In Example 2, the pattern of `7`s leads to specific `3`s placed accordingly in the output.

From these observations, we can deduce that only those cells containing `7` in the input grid will be mapped to `3` in the output grid, and all others will be `0`.

Applying this rule to the test case:
```python
[
[7, 7, 7, 7], # All 7s here will become 3s
[0, 7, 7, 7], # Only the 7s will become 3s
[7, 0, 0, 0],
[7, 0, 7, 0],
[4, 4, 4, 4], # No 7s here, so no change
[0, 2, 2, 2], # No 7s here, so no change
[0, 0, 0, 0], # No 7s here, so no change
[2, 0, 2, 2], # No 7s here, so no change
[0, 2, 0, 0]  # No 7s here, so no change
]

Output Transformation:
- First row: `[7, 7, 7, 7]` -> `[3, 3, 3, 3]`

   This example shows a similar pattern; however, the symmetry is more complex. The pattern is mirrored both horizontally and vertically but with adjustments that ensure the symmetry is maintained while extending the grid.

### Testing Transformation Rule on Test Case

Based on the observed pattern, the transformation involves mirroring the grid in both horizontal and vertical directions with modifications to maintain symmetry.

  1. Double the grid size.
  2. Mirror horizontally and vertically while ensuring symmetrical pattern across the center.

444801d8,"To solve the test case, we need to infer the transformation rule based on the provided examples. Observing the transformations, it seems that each unique color (non-zero value) in the input grid is surrounded by another color in the output grid. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. In Example 1, the color `2` is surrounded by color `2`.
2. The color `1` remains unchanged within its area but the surrounding zero (background) is replaced by color `2` where applicable.
3. In Example 2, color `2` is surrounded by color `2`, and color `3` is similarly surrounded.
4. In Example 3, color `6` replaces zeros surrounding the `1`s which contain `6` inside, and color `8` surrounds the inner `1` area containing `8`.

From these observations, we can deduce that any non-zero color (like 2, 6, or 8) found within an enclosed group of similar numbers will cause the surrounding zeros to change into the color of the enclosed number.

Applying this rule to our Test case:

- The number `4` is surrounded by `1`s, so all surrounding `0`s around `4` should turn into `4`.
- The number `7` is surrounded by `1`s at the bottom, so all surrounding `0`s around `7` should turn into `7`.

Following this logic,

```python
[
[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],

f8c80d96,"To transform the test case, let's analyze the pattern from the training examples:

In all the provided transformations, the following rules seem to apply:

1. All zeros are replaced with alternating 5s and original color values in a checkerboard pattern. That is, if a zero is surrounded by one or more non-zero elements, it gets replaced with 5 if the adjacent non-zero value is in an even row/column position or keeps the original adjacent color pattern if in an odd row/column position.

2. All non-zero cells remain the same as their original values unless they need to follow the checkerboard pattern to maintain consistency.

3. The checkerboard pattern starts from the top left corner where a zero would get a 5, and then alternates every cell across rows and columns.

Let's apply this transformation to the test case:

Test Case Input:

fcc82909,"To identify the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output in the provided examples.

From Example 1:
- New color 3 appears in rows 5 and 8-10.
- The pattern of new colors seems to fill in regions surrounded by other colored shapes without touching the borders of the grid or existing colors.

From Example 2:
- Color 3 is introduced in row 4 and expands to fill the space between other colors (4, 8) and the border of the grid.

From Example 3:
- Color 3 fills in the spaces between numbers 2, 4, and 9 on the top part, and also forms a block below numbers 7 and 6.

It appears that the color 3 is used to fill gaps around existing colors, creating solid blocks where there are blank (zero) spaces not adjacent to any other non-zero values.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- We need to locate regions that are zero but surrounded by other colors or the grid border.
- In the test case, we can see zero-valued cells surrounded by other colors (e.g., between 1, 2, 9, and the border).

So, let's fill these areas with 3s:

44f52bb0,"To identify the transformation rule applied to the input grids to generate the output grids, let's examine the patterns in the examples given.

In all the provided examples, the transformation results in a single number in a single-element grid. This suggests that a specific characteristic of the input grid determines which number appears in the output grid.

Looking at Example 1 and Example 3, we see that both have the same output `[1]`. The input grids for these examples have a central symmetry around the middle row and column with non-zero values forming a cross pattern.

Example 2 and Example 5 have the same output `[7]`, but their pattern differs from those resulting in `[1]`. They have non-zero values in a more diagonal or ""L"" shape.

Based on this observation, we can infer that the presence of a cross pattern of non-zero values (with zeros filling the rest) results in the output `[1]`, while other patterns result in `[7]`.

Applying this rule to the Test Case:

```
[
[2, 0, 2],
[2, 2, 2],
[2, 0, 2]

This grid has a cross pattern, with non-zero values forming the cross and zeros elsewhere. Following the identified rule, this should result in the output `[1]`.

ded97339,"To solve the transformation rule from the examples provided, let's observe the changes applied in each case.

The key observation is that in all the examples, any '8' that appears in an otherwise '0' filled row or column will propagate its value ('8') horizontally and vertically to fill all the zeros in that row or column up to but not crossing any other non-zero value (except at the origin).

Let's break down the observed behavior further:

- If there's an '8' present in a row or column surrounded by '0's, the '8' is expanded to fill the entire row or column with '8's until it meets another '8' or the edge of the grid.
- This expansion only happens in a straight line horizontally and vertically, not diagonally.

Let's apply this understanding to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Following the identified rule:

- In row 1, the '8' at position (1,1) expands horizontally filling the row: `[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`.
- In row 3, the '8' at position (3,4) expands horizontally filling the row: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`.
- In row 4, the '8' at position (4,8) expands horizontally filling the row: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]`.
- In row 6, the '8' at position (6,1) expands horizontally filling the row: `[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`.
- In column 5 and column 8, the two '8's at positions (9,5) and (9,8) expand vertically filling their respective columns with '8's up to the row where they meet the original '8': `[0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]`.

Thus, considering these expansions:

ff28f65a,"To figure out the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the input and output grids provided.

First observation: The outputs are smaller than the inputs, indicating some form of compression or aggregation might be happening.

Second observation: The presence of '2' in the input grid seems to be marked with a '1' in the output, and these are usually the only non-zero values in the output grids.

Examining the position of the '1's in the outputs, they seem to correspond to the presence of '2's in the central regions of the input grids.

Let's establish a hypothesis: the output grid represents whether there is at least one '2' in the corresponding larger ""region"" of the input grid. In other words, every '1' in the output corresponds to a region in the input that contains at least one '2', and a '0' means no '2's in that region.

For example, in Example 1, the '1' in the top left corner of the output grid corresponds to the top left quadrant of the input grid which contains '2's. Similarly, in Example 4, the '1' in the top center of the output corresponds to the central region of the input where '2's are present.

We can now apply this transformation rule to the test case:

The test case input:
``` 
[
[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0],
[2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0],
[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Dividing this into regions (assuming a 3x3 arrangement of regions for the output), we find:
- Top-left: Contains '2'.
- Top-center: Contains '2'.
- Top-right: Contains '2'.
- Middle-left: Contains '2'.
- Middle-center: No '2'.
- Middle-right: Contains '2'.
- Bottom-left: Contains '2'.
- Bottom-center: Contains '2'.
- Bottom-right: No '2'.

Thus the output should be a 3x3 grid where '1' indicates the presence of '2' in that region and '0' otherwise.

Hence the output will be:

- The color `0` remains unchanged.
- The color `5` can be replaced with either `6`, `7`, or `8`. 
- It appears that the colors `6`, `7`, and `8` are used to fill enclosed spaces surrounded by `5`s, which could be interpreted as filling regions defined by the `5` borders.

From the examples, let's see if we can summarize these observations into a rule:

1. Replace zeros (`0`) within an enclosure made of `5`s with one of the interior colors (`6`, `7`, or `8`).
2. The color choice (`6`, `7`, or `8`) seems somewhat arbitrary or pattern-based but consistently applied within an individual region.

a1570a43,"To deduce the transformation rule that leads from the input to the output grids, let's review and compare the changes made in different examples.

Observations:
1. The color `3` remains fixed at its positions.
2. For color `2`, there is an apparent rotation or rearrangement within the grid, while keeping the `3`s stationary.
3. The `2`s seem to move as if the non-zero section of the grid is rotated counter-clockwise about the center.

Let's break down how this transformation can be achieved:
- Consider the core area with `2`s and identify the boundaries.
- Rotate this core section counter-clockwise by 90 degrees.

For example:
In Example 1, the `2`s form a sort of L-shape that gets repositioned after the rotation.
In Example 2, the `2`s form a more complex shape but still follow the pattern of rotating around the `3`s.
In Example 3, the `2`s also rotate inside the boundaries, moving around while maintaining the shape.

Applying these observations to the Test case:

f8ff0b80,"To identify the transformation rule, let's examine the patterns in the provided examples:

In all training examples, the output grids are significantly smaller than the corresponding input grids, and they contain only one number per row.

Let's look at the first example:
- **Input**: We can see several ""blobs"" of colors: 3s, 2s, and 8s.
- **Output**: The output consists of a single column containing each color that forms the largest contiguous blob in the input image.

The process seems to be:
1. Identify the regions (contiguous groups) of the same color in the input grid.
2. Sort these regions based on their size.
3. Output the largest region's color in each row of the output grid from top to bottom.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- From this, we can identify three blobs:

  - 1s (center-left)
  - 6s (lower right)

- These regions' sizes are: 
  - 3s: Area = 2

- Sorted by size (largest first): 6, 1, 3.

0962bcdd,"To determine the transformation rule, we need to observe the changes from the input grids to the output grids in the training examples.

From the examples, we can see that any group of cells containing `7`s and `2`s or `8`s and `6`s get surrounded by additional cells filled with `2`s or `6`s respectively. The surrounding cells form a border around the original shapes.

Let's examine the transformation rule in detail:

1. **Shape of Original Patterns**: 
   - In Example 1, the pattern consists of `7`'s and a single `2` in its center.
   - In Example 2, the pattern consists of `8`'s and a single `6` in its center.

2. **Transformation Rule**:
   - Any cell with value `7` or `8` gets a surrounding border of `2` or `6`, respectively, around the entire shape.
   - The center of these shapes remains unchanged.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- We have `3`'s and `4`'s in our pattern which suggests a new transformation for those numbers.
- Following the same structure, we assume that `3`'s will be surrounded by `2`'s (if no alternative rule is provided) and `4`'s remain as they are.

Now, let's apply the transformation to the test case using these observations:

1. Example 1: The output grid keeps only the first three columns from the input grid.

2. Example 2: Similarly, the output grid retains only the first four columns from the input grid.

   - Output has 4 columns.

3. Example 3: Once again, the output grid consists of just the first two columns from the input grid.
   - Input has 6 columns.
   - Output has 2 columns.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves retaining only the first few columns of the input grid. Specifically, the number of columns retained in the output grid seems to be one-third of the total number of columns in the input grid (rounded down).

To apply this rule to the test case:
- The test case input has 15 columns.
- One-third of 15 columns equals 5 columns.

Therefore, the output grid should consist of the first 5 columns of the test case input.

Applying this rule, the solution would be:

a85d4709,"To understand the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids, let's examine the provided examples closely.

Firstly, we can notice that the pattern of zeros in the input grid seems to dictate the numbers in the output grid. However, there's no apparent direct mapping between the number 5 and a specific digit in the output. Instead, the outputs appear to have three distinct digits (2, 3, and 4) which seem to fill in based on some rule related to the position or pattern of 5s in the input grid.

Let's analyze each example:

Example 1:
- Input has one 5 in each row and column.
- Output has all 3s in the first row, all 4s in the second, and all 2s in the third.

Example 2:
- All 5s in the same column.
- Output is all 3s everywhere.

Example 3:
- 5s diagonally.
- Output is 2s in the rows where 5s are not, and 4s elsewhere.

Example 4:
- 5s in a vertical and horizontal cross.
- Output is alternating rows of 4s and 3s.

From these examples, it looks like the pattern of 2s, 3s, and 4s may correspond to the pattern and relative positions of the 5s in the input grid. We can infer that each unique pattern of zeros and 5s results in a corresponding pattern in the output with the digits 2, 3, and 4.

For the test input:
```
[0, 0, 5],
[5, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 0]

We see a diagonal cross pattern similar to Example 3 but rotated. Given the observed pattern, this should result in a similarly rotated version of Example 3's output.

Thus, the output would be:

1b60fb0c,"From the provided training examples, we can observe that the transformation rule involves adding a '2' in certain locations within the grid.

1. The '2's seem to be added around clusters of '1's that have at least one '1' touching the edge of the grid.
2. Specifically, '2's are added in cells directly next to '1's (in the vertical or horizontal direction) that are not already surrounded by other '1's on all sides.

Let's break down the pattern:

- In Example 1, '2's are added in the third row from the top where there are '1's touching the outer boundary of the cluster.
- In Example 2, '2's surround the top left cluster of '1's, indicating that they are added around any '1's that touch the boundary of the cluster but are not completely enclosed by other '1's.
- In Example 3, the same logic applies with '2's being placed around the '1's that touch the boundary but are not completely enclosed.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test case:

63613498,"To understand the transformation rule applied in the given examples, let's analyze the changes made from the input to the output.

In all examples provided, we observe that a color (integer) is replaced with another color (integer) within specific regions. Specifically, when a certain cluster of colors appears, it is replaced with another cluster of the same shape and size but with a different color value. Let's look at the examples more closely:

- **Example 1** to **Output**: The color `6` in the middle right region has been replaced by `5`.
- **Example 2** to **Output**: The color `9` in the bottom left region has been replaced by `5`.
- **Example 3** to **Output**: The color `1` in the top right region has been replaced by `5`.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation involves replacing one color with another within a contiguous region of the grid. For the test case, we need to identify similar patterns and apply a similar replacement.

The test case grid contains several distinct clusters:
- `5`s in the top left region.
- `6`s in the top right region.
- `2`s in the center upper part.
- `3`s in the center lower part.
- `8`s on the left side.
- `4`s on the bottom right.
- `7`s on the bottom central.

Given the pattern observed, it seems likely that any color might be replaced by another, particularly focusing on smaller or isolated clusters. In this test case, the `2`s seem isolated enough to be potentially replaced. If we replace `2`s with `5`s (following the pattern seen in other examples where isolated clusters are replaced), we get:

```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],
[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

However, this does not match the exact transformations seen before. Considering the minimal change rule, let's focus on the smallest isolated cluster, the single `2` not part of a larger group. Since there’s no clear pattern suggesting which color should replace it, we will leave it unchanged.

Therefore, the most logical transformation based on the patterns observed is simply leaving the input grid as it is.

**Observations:**
1. The innermost non-zero elements remain unchanged.
2. The outermost layer of zeros surrounding these inner elements gets updated with numbers that match the immediate non-zero neighbors in the original input grid.
3. This process seems to apply a ""border"" effect where the zeros take on the color of the closest non-zero value but only along the borders.

Let's break down the examples:

- **Example 1**: The center `2` remains untouched; the zeros around it take on the neighboring `4` value, creating a border of `4`s.
- **Example 2**: Similar pattern, with zeros getting updated based on the nearest non-zero values (`8`, `3`), creating borders.
- **Example 3**: The zeros in the top layers transform into `1`s based on the closest non-zero value (`1`).
- **Example 4**: The larger grid shows more complex patterns, but still follows the rule of updating the zero cells to the nearest non-zero value when applicable.

Given these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as:

- For each zero cell in the grid, check its adjacent cells. If an adjacent cell is non-zero, change the zero to the same value as that non-zero cell. Only the outermost zeros get transformed.

**Applying the rule to our test case:**

694f12f3,"To understand the transformation applied to the input grids:

1. We notice that the grids contain a solid color block (in these cases, color `4`) surrounded by zeros.
2. Inside these blocks, some cells change from color `4` to a new color value (`1` or `2`).
3. The transformation seems to apply only to internal cells in the middle of the block; cells along the edge do not change.

The pattern suggests that the transformation only affects the internal cells of a block if there is an enclosed space within the block. When we say ""internal cells"", we mean those which are surrounded on all sides by other cells of the same color. In both training examples, the center cells of the larger block were changed to another color (`1` or `2`).

For the test case:
- The top-left portion consists of a larger square of 4's. The center of this square should be transformed.
- The bottom-right portion consists of another square of 4's, but with fewer rows. The center of this square should also be transformed.

Given the observed patterns, I predict that the internal cells of each large block will change. The choice of new color doesn't follow a clear pattern across examples, so I'll choose `1` for simplicity and consistency with Example 1.

Let's apply this to the test case:

d2abd087,"To determine the transformation rule applied in the examples provided, we need to analyze the differences between the input and output grids.

Observations:
- In the output grids, the color `5` from the input grids is replaced by either `1` or `2`.
- The replacement appears to be done based on the position of the color `5` in the grid.
- Each isolated region of `5`s is assigned a different color (`1` or `2`), based on its location in the grid.

Analyzing the pattern more closely:
- Regions of `5`s that are positioned towards the left side of the grid tend to be replaced with `1`.
- Regions of `5`s that are positioned towards the right side of the grid tend to be replaced with `2`.

Applying these observations to the test case:

Input:
```python
[
[0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0],

The expected transformation according to the observed rule would be:
- Replace the `5`s in the left regions with `1`.
- Replace the `5`s in the right regions with `2`.

Thus, the output for the test case should be:

d406998b,"To figure out the transformation rule applied to the grids in the training examples, let's examine the differences between the inputs and outputs carefully.

In each example, we see that:
- The number `5` appears frequently within both input and output.
- In the output, some instances of `5` are replaced with `3`, but not all `5`s are replaced.

Upon closer inspection, we can observe a pattern where:
- If a `5` appears in a position that is part of an alternating pattern (e.g., every other column or row has `5`) and it's not the first occurrence in the row or column, it gets changed to `3`.

Based on this observation, the rule seems to be:
- For each row and column, starting from the second 5 encountered in that line (row or column), replace the `5` with `3`.

Applying this rule to the test case:

1. Examine each row and column, starting from the second `5` found, and replace it with `3`.
   
For the first row `[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0]`:
- Change third and fourth `5` to `3`: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]`

For the second row `[5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]`:
- Change second, third, and fourth `5` to `3`: `[5, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]`

For the third row `[0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5]`:
- Change second, third, and fourth `5` to `3`: `[0, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3]`

363442ee,"To solve the test case, let's try to identify the pattern that was applied in the previous examples:

In all three examples, we can see a section of the grid, consisting of non-zero elements, being replicated or mirrored. The common feature is that there's an initial section on the left part of the grid with non-zero elements, which extends to the right with zeros, followed by additional non-zero elements in some rows.

The transformation rule seems to be replicating the colors (non-zero elements) from the initial non-zero section across the grid, filling in the zeros based on the pattern of colors found in the first few columns.

In particular, the sections containing non-zero numbers to the right of the main area (that initially contains zeros) seem to be used as triggers for filling in the zero areas. These filled-in sections often mirror the pattern seen in the left-most non-zero part of the grid.

Using these observations, I apply the transformation rule to the test case:

- The left part of the grid with non-zero elements looks like this:
```
[
[3, 3, 9, 5],
[8, 4, 4, 5],
[8, 9, 8, 5]
]
```
- The rest of the zeros will be filled based on the above pattern, with non-zero elements acting as triggers to replicate the left pattern.

Following the pattern observed from the examples provided:
```python
# Initial pattern
pattern = [
    [3, 3, 9, 5],
    [8, 4, 4, 5],
    [8, 9, 8, 5],
]

# Replicating the pattern based on the triggers
output = []
for i in range(len(pattern)):
    row = pattern[i] + pattern[i][:3] + ([0]*6)
    output.append(row)

# Adding rows of zeros with appropriate replications
for _ in range(3):
    output.append([0]*len(output[0]))

# Adding more rows based on the pattern and triggers
output.append(pattern[0] + pattern[0][:3] + ([0]*6))
output.append(pattern[1] + pattern[1][:3] + ([0]*6))
output.append(pattern[0] + pattern[0][:3] + ([0]*6))

# Final output

```

This gives us the final output for the test case:

93b581b8,"To solve the test case, let's first understand the transformation rules based on the provided examples.

### Observations:
- In all examples, the center of the grid (or closest to it) contains non-zero numbers.
- The non-zero numbers spread outwards in a symmetrical pattern.
- The symmetrical spread fills up the rows and columns around the center block with the numbers from the center.

### Pattern Analysis:
1. **Identify the core non-zero elements**: In each example, there are two sets of non-zero numbers that are symmetrically placed within the grid.
2. **Symmetry**: Each set of non-zero numbers appears mirrored across both horizontal and vertical axes.
3. **Spread Pattern**: The numbers at the core spread outwards filling the adjacent rows and columns. Specifically, the pattern seems to fill up the edges of the grid with the numbers from the inner core.

### Steps to Apply Transformation:
- Identify the non-zero numbers in the center of the grid.
- The numbers spread outward in a symmetric manner.

#### Example Breakdown:
Let's take Example 1 for detailed breakdown:

**Input**:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 9, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

**Output**:
```
[
[8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 7],
[8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 7],
[0, 0, 9, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0],
[3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9],
[3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9]
]
```

- Numbers `9` and `3` spread upwards and downwards.
- Numbers `7` and `8` spread leftwards and rightwards.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case

**Test Input**:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

**Steps**:
- Core numbers: `3, 1` and `2, 5`.
- Spread the numbers `3` and `1` outward.
- Spread the numbers `2` and `5` outward.

So the expected output would look like:

**Output**:

150deff5,"To solve the test case, we need to identify the pattern or rule applied in transforming the input grids into the output grids.

From the training examples, we can observe the following:
1. The color `5` in the input transforms into either `8` or `2` in the output.
2. The transformation seems to depend on the positioning of the `5`s within the grid. Specifically, when there's a cluster of `5`s, some parts transform into `8` while others into `2`. This suggests that the transformation might be based on adjacency or grouping of `5`s.

The pattern observed in previous transformations suggests:
- The `5`s at the edges of larger groups may transform into `8`.
- The `5`s within smaller clusters or at the center of larger groups may transform into `2`.

Applying this understanding:
- The `5`s in the top-left corner will likely transform into `8`.
- The `5`s in the middle will be mixed with `8` and `2`, depending on their grouping and position.

Output Grid based on the transformation rule:
```
[0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],

3e980e27,"To solve this puzzle, I'll analyze the transformation rules that apply across the training examples.

1. Observe the general behavior first: In all the examples, there's some shifting or rearrangement of numbers downward while keeping certain positions untouched. For instance, any zeros remain unaffected.

2. Notice how the numbers are moving: When a number appears in the lower part of the input grid and there's an empty space (represented by zeros) above it where the same number exists in a different column, it seems the number is shifted to align with these existing numbers above. This can be seen in Example 1 and Example 2 specifically with the movement of the '1' and '2'.

3. Analyze the specific movements: 
   - Example 1 shows a '2' and '1' at the bottom moving to fill gaps aligned with their counterparts.
   - Example 2 and Example 3 show patterns of moving '4', '3', and '8' from the bottom up to align with their counterparts or into an available space.
   - Example 4 has more complex movements, but similar principles apply to numbers '4', '2', '1', and '3'.

By studying these patterns, we can infer the rule might involve checking for the presence of a color below an empty space and then moving that color up to align with its counterpart if possible, or filling an available space in the same column.

Applying this logic to the test case:

bda2d7a6,"To derive the transformation rule from the input to output grids seen in the training examples, let's break down the changes:

1. **Outermost frame transformation:** In all the examples, the outermost layer of the grid, which forms a kind of border, gets its color value switched to another value that seems to be derived from the immediate inner layer. Specifically, the outermost layer takes on the color of the next inner layer.

2. **Inner layers transformation:** Each inner layer retains its pattern but with its original color being replaced. The replacement color appears to be derived from the surrounding cells in the immediate outer layer.

Analyzing this, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- Replace the color of the outermost layer with the color that's immediately inside it.
- For each remaining layer, replace their colors with the color of the cells surrounding them.

Applying this transformation to the test case:

Test Input:
``` [
  [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],
  [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9],
  [9, 0, 1, 1, 0, 9],
  [9, 0, 1, 1, 0, 9],
  [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9],
  [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
] ```

Following our rule:
1. The outermost `9`s become `0`s because `0` is the immediate inner color.
2. For the `0`s surrounding the `1`s, they remain `0` as that is their color.
3. The `1`s stay `1` as they are surrounded by `0`s.

Thus the transformed output should look like:

a48eeaf7,"To figure out the transformation rule, let's compare the input and output of both training examples.

In Example 1:
- The number `5` in row 3 column 4 moves up to row 2 column 4.
- The `5` in row 7 column 8 moves up to row 6 column 6.
- The `2`s in row 4 columns 4 and 5 remain in place but are now flanked by the `5` that moved in row 4 column 6.

In Example 2:
- The `5` in row 1 column 9 moves up to row 2 column 8.
- The `2`s in row 3 columns 6 and 7 remain in place but are now flanked by the `5` that moved in row 4 column 5.
- The `5` in row 7 column 10 is now in row 5 column 7.
- The `5` in row 9 column 6 moves up to row 5 column 6.

Based on these observations, it appears that the rule is to move any `5` upwards until they either reach the top of the grid or are blocked by another `5` or `2`. If two `5`s overlap while moving, the overlapping `5` stops at the position where it meets the other `5`, potentially leaving an empty space between them.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case:
- The `5` in row 1 column 3 moves up to row 1.
- The `5` in row 2 column 9 moves up to row 1 column 9.
- The `5` in row 10 column 3 moves up to row 2 column 3.
- The `5` in row 7 column 8 moves up to row 6 column 8.

The `2`s stay in their positions but might get flanked by moving `5`s.

Therefore, the transformed grid for the test case should look like this:

Observations:
- Each non-zero cell (color 5) in the input grid is replaced with another value in the output grid.
- The replacement seems to follow a pattern based on the relative positions of the non-zero cells. There appear to be distinct regions where cells are consistently replaced with specific numbers.

From Example 1:
- Cells that were color 5 in column 1 and row 2-8 become 1.
- Cells that were color 5 in column 4 and row 3-8 become 4.
- Cells that were color 5 in column 8 and row 5-7 become 2.

From Example 2:
- Cells that were color 5 in column 5 and row 2-6 become 1.
- Cells that were color 5 in column 1 and row 4-6 become 4.
- Cells that were color 5 in column 8 and row 6-7 become 2.

From Example 3:
- Cells that were color 5 in row 3 become 1.
- Cells that were color 5 in column 8 and row 4-7 become 4.
- Cells that were color 5 in column 3 and row 8 become 2.

From Example 4:
- Cells that were color 5 in column 8 and row 2-8 become 1.
- Cells that were color 5 in column 2-5 and row 3 become 2.
- Cells that were color 5 in column 2-6 and row 6 become 4.

These observations suggest that each region of connected non-zero cells in the input has its own unique mapping to a different number in the output. To solve the test case, we will apply the same logic:
- The cells that were color 5 in column 4 and row 2-4 should be mapped to the same value, likely 1 based on previous patterns.
- The cells that were color 5 in column 5-10 and row 6 should be mapped to a unique value, likely 2 based on previous patterns.
- The cells that were color 5 in column 1-5 and row 9 should be mapped to a unique value, likely 4 based on previous patterns.

e98196ab,"To find the transformation rule applied to the grids, let's analyze the provided examples.

For the first example, we can see that the output grid is reduced in size compared to the input. It seems that the middle row where all elements are 5s has been removed. The surrounding elements have remained in their positions but have been shifted down to fill the gap left by the removed row. Similarly, all columns filled entirely with zeroes are gone, and other columns have filled the gap left by the removed column.

Analyzing the second example follows the same logic. A central row of 5s is removed, and the surrounding elements are rearranged. In addition, some columns with zero values are removed.

The third example also shows removal of the middle row filled with 5s and a repositioning of surrounding elements, along with column adjustments.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:

1. Remove the middle row which contains only one unique value.
2. Remove any full columns that consist entirely of zeroes.
3. Rearrange the remaining rows and columns according to the above rules.

e3497940,"To derive the transformation rule based on the training examples:

1. Every input grid has a central column that holds the value `5`, which seems to be a key element.
2. In general, the output grid width is significantly reduced, specifically to a width of 4 columns.
3. The central column (`5`s) seems to be preserved in the middle of the new 4-column outputs.
4. The neighboring columns around the central column are collapsed, meaning the values from the original wider columns are condensed into the smaller 4-column output. This is evident as the output grid keeps the color pattern (non-zero values) close to the center while discarding the outer zero columns.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- Identify the central column holding `5`s.
- Condense the surrounding columns into a 4-column format, preserving the non-zero patterns closest to the center and discarding the outer zeros.

Based on these observations and the rule described, the solution for the test case can be constructed as follows:

From the given examples, we can observe the following:

1. The input grids have a mixture of colors (represented by numbers).
2. The output grids mostly contain zeros and the number 2 appears only in certain positions.
3. The locations where the number 2 appears in the output are related to the locations of the color 3 in the corresponding input.

Analyzing the specific transformations:
- When the number 3 is present in the input grid at some positions, these positions are transformed into a pattern with 2s in the output grid.
- The 2s in the output seem to form specific patterns that appear to be a reflection or a reduced version of the original pattern formed by 3s in the input grid.
- The other colors in the original grid, such as 1, do not affect the formation of 2s in the result.

Given the above observations, the rule seems to be transforming the pattern of 3s in the input grid into a smaller pattern of 2s in the output grid, while the rest of the grid remains as zeros.

Let's apply this understanding to the test case:

Test Case Input:

- We see a cross shape of 3s in the upper half of the input test grid.
- Based on previous examples, this cross shape would be transformed into a smaller pattern of 2s.

The output should show a transformation of this cross shape into a smaller cross or similar pattern.

Thus, the output grid for the test case will be:

e48d4e1a,"Analyzing the transformation pattern in the provided training examples, the following key points can be deduced:

1. Each input grid has a prominent central column (or row) with a consistent non-zero value, surrounded by zeros.
2. This central column (or row) is shifted towards a different position in the output grid while maintaining its size and shape.
3. In each case, the entire grid appears to be rotated such that the central column (or row) is moved to a new position, but the overall structure remains intact.

In Example 1, the central column at index 3 is moved to index 1. 
In Example 2, the column at index 3 moves to index 0.
In Example 3, the column at index 6 moves to index 3.
In Example 4, the column at index 4 moves to index 3.

It seems like the transformation rule involves shifting the position of the central column (or row) to another column (or row).

For the Test Case:
The input has a column at index 5 with value 8. Following the observed pattern, we need to determine where this column should be moved. Considering the previous examples, if we generalize the pattern, the column at index X is moved to index Y where Y is some calculated position relative to X or some fixed position in each example.

Examining Example 1 through 4, we see the shift is consistently two positions to the left. For the test case, the column at index 5 should be moved two positions to the left, to index 3.

Therefore, the output should have the column with value 8 starting at index 3.

1. In Example 1, we see that a new color (8) appears at certain positions where there was previously no color (0), and the arrangement of the existing colors (3 and 2) has been altered.
   
2. In Example 2, the pattern of the color (3) and color (2) seems to have shifted downwards. Additionally, a line of color (8) is inserted after the first five rows.

3. In Example 3, again, there is a rearrangement of the original colors (2 and 3), and another insertion of a row of color (8).

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- Move the entire shape made up of colors (3) and (2) downward until it reaches the bottom or is blocked by the edge of the grid.
- Insert a new line of color (8) above the moved shape.

Applying this rule to the test case:

1. Identify the shape made up of colors (2) and (3).
2. Move the shape down to the bottom of the grid.
3. Insert a line with color (8) just above the moved shape.

1cf80156,"To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the transformation rule from the provided examples. Observing the input and output grids:

1. **Identify Non-Zero Elements:** In each input grid, there are non-zero elements (colors) surrounded by zeros.
2. **Determine Boundaries:** The output grid seems to capture only the part of the input grid that contains these specific non-zero elements without the surrounding zeros.

Let's analyze this transformation step-by-step using the provided examples:

- **Example 1:** The non-zero elements (colored 2) are present in a certain region of the grid. The output grid captures only this region.
- **Example 2:** Similar pattern, but with color 1. The output is a subset of the input grid that includes all the 1s, removing any surrounding zeros.
- **Example 3:** Here, the color is 8. Again, the output is a smaller grid that includes only the parts containing the number 8.

From these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- Identify the smallest bounding box in the input grid that contains all non-zero elements.
- Crop the input grid to this bounding box.

Applying this rule to the test case:

The test case has the number 6 in certain regions. Let us identify the smallest bounding box with these numbers:

```plaintext
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],  <- Start row

[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  <- End row
```

The bounding box starts at row 4 and ends at row 7, columns 4 to 7. When we crop the grid to this box, we get:

```plaintext

[6, 6, 6, 6],
[6, 0, 0, 0],

97999447,"To figure out the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the examples.

In all provided examples, when there is a non-zero integer in the input grid, it appears that the next column to the right contains a ""5"" and this pattern persists, alternating with the non-zero integer in every other column. 

Let’s break down the process:

1. Identify the columns where a non-zero integer exists.
2. For those columns, alternate the pattern of the original number with ""5"".
3. This alternation continues until the end of the row.

Here's how the transformation applies to each example:

- In Example 1, the ""2"" at position (2, 2) results in a sequence ""2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5"" in that row. Similarly, ""6"" at position (5, 3) creates a sequence ""6, 5, 6, 5, 6"".

- In Example 2, ""2"" at (1, 2) and ""3"" at (4, 1) follow similar rules. The ""6"" at (5, 6) also follows the pattern resulting in ""6, 5, 6, 5"".

- Example 3 shows a ""8"" at position (3, 3), which becomes ""8, 5, 8, 5"" in its corresponding row.

Now, we can apply the same transformation to the test case:

The test case has ""3"" at position (1, 3), ""4"" at (2, 2), ""8"" at (4, 4), and ""2"" at (6, 3).

Applying our transformation rule:
- For ""3"", the sequence will be: ""3, 5, 3, 5, 3, 5, 3, 5""
- For ""4"", the sequence will be: ""4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5""
- For ""8"", the sequence will be: ""8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 5""
- For ""2"", the sequence will be: ""2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5""

Therefore, the output grid should look like this:

aedd82e4,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that transforms the input grids into their respective output grids. Let's look at the differences:

- In Example 1, the bottom right corner changes from `0` to `1`.
- In Example 2, two changes occur: the `(2,3)` position changes from `2` to `1`, and the `(3,1)` position changes from `2` to `1`.
- In Example 3, only one change happens: the `(2,3)` position changes from `2` to `1`.
- In Example 4, two changes happen: the `(1,2)` and `(2,1)` positions change from `2` to `1`.

From these observations, it seems the rule involves changing certain `2`s to `1`s. Specifically, the `2`s that are isolated or part of smaller clusters seem to be changed to `1`s.

Let's apply this rule to our test case:

```python
input_grid = [
    [2, 2, 0, 2],
    [0, 2, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 2, 0],
    [2, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 2, 2]
]
```

Analyzing this grid:

- The `2`s in the first row form a cluster and should remain as `2`s.
- The `2` in the `(1,1)` position is isolated, so it should be changed to `1`.
- The `2` in the `(2,2)` position is also isolated, so it should be changed to `1`.
- The `2` in the `(3,0)` position is isolated, so it should be changed to `1`.
- The `2`s in the `(4,2)` and `(4,3)` positions form a cluster and should remain as `2`s.

Applying the rule, the transformed grid would be:

```python
output_grid = [
    [2, 2, 0, 2],
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 2, 2]

So the answer to the test case is:

681b3aeb,"To derive the transformation rule, let's closely examine the provided training examples.

In each example, the output grid appears to be composed of a smaller grid that includes only the non-zero elements from the input grid, while preserving their relative positions. Specifically:

1. Identify all non-zero elements in the input grid.
2. Determine the bounding box (the smallest rectangle that can enclose all non-zero elements).
3. Crop the input grid based on this bounding box, resulting in the output grid.

Let's apply these steps to each training example to confirm the pattern:

**Example 1 Analysis:**
- Bounding Box: From row 2 to 5, and column 1 to 2; and from row 8 to 10, column 7 to 10.
- Cropped Grid: 
  ```
  [3, 3, 7]

  ```
- Non-zero elements only:
  ```
  [3, 3, 7]
  [3, 7, 7]
  [3, 7, 7]
  ```

**Example 2 Analysis:**
- Bounding Box: From row 2 to 5, column 3 to 6; and from row 1 to 2, column 8 to 10.
- Cropped Grid:
  ```
  [6, 6, 6, 4, 4]
  [0, 6, 6, 4, 4]
  [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
  ```
- Non-zero elements only:
  ```
  [6, 6, 6]
  [4, 6, 6]
  [4, 4, 6]
  ```

**Example 3 Analysis:**
- Bounding Box: From row 5 to 7, column 3 to 5; and from row 9 to 10, column 1 to 4.
- Cropped Grid:
  ```
  [3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ```
- Non-zero elements only:
  ```
  [1, 1, 1]
  [1, 3, 1]
  [3, 3, 3]
  ```

Now, applying the identified pattern to the Test case:

**Test Case Analysis:**
- Bounding Box: From row 2 to 4, column 3 to 5; and from row 7 to 9, column 7 to 10.
- Cropped Grid:

- Non-zero elements only:
  ```
  [2, 2, 8, 8, 8]

Removing zero placeholders to match the pattern:

c9e6f938,"To solve this puzzle, we observe the transformation pattern from the provided training examples.

In all examples, the output grid size is increased and contains mirrored versions of the input grid along with some added zero padding. Specifically:

- The number of columns in the output is twice the number of columns in the input.
- Each row in the input is mirrored and appended to itself to form the corresponding row in the output, with zeros filling certain positions to maintain symmetry or padding.

Let's break down the process with Example 1:
Input:
```
[
[0, 7, 0],
[0, 0, 7],
[0, 7, 7]
]
```
Output:
```
[
[0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0],
[0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0],
[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]]
```
Here:
- The first row `[0, 7, 0]` becomes `[0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]`.
- The second row `[0, 0, 7]` becomes `[0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]`.
- The third row `[0, 7, 7]` becomes `[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]`.

Next, let's apply this understanding to the test case:

Input:
```
[
[7, 7, 0],
[0, 7, 0],
[0, 0, 7]]
```

We follow the same mirroring and padding pattern:
- The first row `[7, 7, 0]` mirrors to `[7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7]`.
- The second row `[0, 7, 0]` mirrors to `[0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]`.
- The third row `[0, 0, 7]` mirrors to `[0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]`.

Thus, the output will be:

28bf18c6,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to generate the output grids, let's analyze the patterns in the training examples:

1. **Size Transformation**: In each example, the output grid has fewer rows and columns compared to the input grid. Specifically, the output seems to have half the width and height of the input grid.

2. **Color Aggregation**: The value of each cell in the output appears to be derived from the combination or aggregation of values from four corresponding cells in the input. It seems that the output cell at position [i][j] is computed based on the cells in positions [2*i][2*j], [2*i+1][2*j], [2*i][2*j+1], and [2*i+1][2*j+1] in the input grid.

3. **Aggregation Logic**: The value of output cell [i][j] is the most frequent non-zero color among the four input cells. If there's no non-zero color, the output cell becomes 0.

Based on these observations, we can apply the transformation to the test case:

**Input Test Grid:**

- For the first row and first column of the output grid:
  - Input cells: [4][4] = 3, [4][5] = 0, [5][4] = 3, [5][5] = 3.
  - Most frequent non-zero color: 3.
  
- For the first row and second column of the output grid:
  - Input cells: [4][6] = 0, [4][7] = 0, [5][6] = 0, [5][7] = 0.
  - Most frequent non-zero color: 0.

- Continue this process for the entire grid.

2. The whole grid is then mirrored along its horizontal axis.

Let us break down the steps for the test case:

**Input for Test Case**
```
[

[8, 5, 2],

**Step 1: Identify and Duplicate Middle Row**
The middle row in our test case is [8, 5, 2]. We duplicate this row:
```
[2, 9, 2]
[8, 5, 2]
[8, 5, 2]
[2, 2, 8]
```

**Step 2: Mirror Along Horizontal Axis**
After duplication, we need to mirror the grid along the horizontal axis, which means repeating the sequence of rows from bottom to top:
```
[2, 9, 2]     // original top row
[8, 5, 2]     // original second row
[8, 5, 2]     // duplication of middle row
[2, 2, 8]     // original bottom row
[8, 5, 2]     // mirrored duplication of middle row
[8, 5, 2]     // mirrored second row
[2, 9, 2]     // mirrored top row

   - The outermost layer of 3s extended to fill in the gaps where no 6s existed.

3. In Example 3, there was a similar pattern with 8s and 9s.
   - A central square of 8s remained intact.
   - The 9s above and below the central 8s expanded outwards, creating symmetry around the 8s.

Based on these observations, we can infer that the rule involves expanding the color patterns outward while maintaining symmetry. Specifically, for each unique color, it spreads to the adjacent cells if those cells are empty (0).

Applying this logic to the Test case:

The central 2, surrounded by 3s, could potentially expand outward. Here’s how the pattern should evolve:
- The 3s should extend further, wrapping around the 2s symmetrically.
- The 2s should extend up to the edges of the 3s to maintain the symmetry and connectivity of the shapes.

Following this rule, here is the transformed grid for the test case:

e5062a87,"To identify the transformation rule applied to the inputs to generate the outputs, let's analyze the differences between the input and output of each example.

In all provided examples, the core pattern seems to be that certain specific values (mainly 2s) appear in some cells that previously did not have those values. This suggests that the transformation rule might involve filling in some cells with the value 2 if they meet certain criteria.

Looking closely at each example:

- In Example 1, several 2s appear in positions where there was either a 0 or 5 before.
- Example 2 exhibits a similar behavior, with 2s being introduced into areas that had been mostly 0s.
- Example 3 follows the same pattern, with 2s appearing around existing 2s, suggesting a spreading effect from pre-existing 2s.

Given these observations, the rule appears to be:

1. Identify all cells with the value 2 in the initial grid.
2. For each cell with a 2, check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).
3. If a neighbor has the value 0, change that neighbor to 2.

Applying this rule to our test case:

The initial grid has two 2s:
- One at position (4,5) and the other at (4,6).

We then look at their neighbors:
- The 2 at (4,5) has a 0 immediately above, below, and to the left.
- The 2 at (4,6) also has a 0 immediately above, below, and to the right.

Based on the transformation rule, we convert all identified 0s neighboring the 2s to 2s.

Thus, the solution would be:

963e52fc,"To find the transformation rule from the inputs to the outputs, let's analyze the given examples:

1. Example 1: The output grid is wider than the input grid - each row in the output is a repetition of the corresponding row in the input but twice the width.
2. Example 2: Similarly, the output grid is wider by duplicating the elements of the pattern row-wise.
3. Example 3: Again, the output grid is a duplication of the input row-wise, making the width double.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is to repeat each row twice horizontally.

Applying this transformation to the test case:

- The first row `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- The second row `[3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1]` becomes `[3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3]`.
- The third row `[3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1]` becomes `[3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3]`.
- The fourth row `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

e26a3af2,"To solve the test case, first we need to observe the pattern in the transformations from the input grids to the output grids of the training examples.

Observations:
1. In Example 1, every non-1, non-3, non-8, and non-2 value in each column is changed to match the most common color in that column above it.
2. In Example 2, similar to Example 1, every non-2, non-8, and non-1 value in each column is replaced with the most common color in that column above it.
3. In Example 3, the same principle applies; non-3, non-7, non-8, and non-1 values in each column are altered to reflect the most common color in that column above them.

So, the general rule appears to be reducing each column to a single predominant color by replacing all other colors with this predominant color based on their frequency in each column above their position.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Step 1: Analyze each column starting from the top and identify the most frequent color above each cell.

Step 2: For each column, replace any cells not matching the most frequent color above it (from top to bottom) with the most frequent color.

Following steps 1 and 2, let's transform the test case grid.

6a1e5592,"To understand the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes made from the inputs to the outputs in the training examples:

For both sets of inputs and outputs, we can observe that:
- Color `0` changes to `1` when surrounded or adjacent to other `0`s.
- `Color 5` and `color 2` do not change.
- The change from `0` to `1` happens progressively upwards from the bottom part of the grid where `0`s are located, and it stops once all reachable `0` cells have been turned into `1`s.

The rule seems to involve converting `0` to `1` in connected regions starting from the bottom of the grid. The conversion does not affect `2` and `5`, and it only happens when the `0` is connected horizontally or vertically to another `0`.

88a10436,"First, let's analyze the transformation rule that converts the input grids into the output grids based on the provided training examples:

1. **Identify the non-zero clusters**: In each example, the non-zero numbers form clusters in the upper left corner of the grid.

2. **Movement of Clusters**: The clusters seem to move downwards and to the right, maintaining their relative positions but filling the first available empty spaces in the grid starting from the top-left corner.

3. **Cluster Order**: The order of the clusters is preserved as they move. This means that the cluster with the smallest Y-coordinate (topmost) moves first, followed by subsequent clusters below it, and within a cluster, the leftmost elements move first.

Let's look at Example 1:
- We have a cluster at the top-left corner.
- Then there's another cluster below it, containing the same set of numbers.
- The bottom-right cluster of `5` is moved up and to the left to fill the next available space.

For Example 2:
- Similar movement down and to the right is observed, where the cluster with `6`, `1`, and `2` in the middle right of the initial grid is moved to the top left of the lower half of the grid.

For Example 3:
- The cluster is again shifted down and to the right, and the order of shifting maintains the relative position of each number in relation to the others.

Applying these rules to the test case:
- We have clusters containing `2`, `1`, and `3`.
- Following the pattern of moving these clusters down and to the right while preserving their relative positions, we can predict the new positions of each number.

Based on the analysis:
- The cluster `2` moves down and to the right, filling the next available spot.
- The cluster `1` follows suit.
- And finally, the cluster `3`.

23581191,"To solve the test case, I will analyze the transformation rules based on the provided examples.

Observations:
- In both training examples, the number `8` appears initially at a single position in the input grid.
- This `8` then spreads to form a vertical and horizontal line, touching all other numbers (`7` in the examples) or edges of the grid.
- The number `7` also appears initially at a single position in the input grid.
- This `7` then spreads vertically and horizontally to touch the `8` or edges of the grid.
- Numbers `2` appear where these lines intersect (at the positions where the vertical/horizontal spread of `8` and `7` meet).

From these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves spreading the locations marked with `8` and `7` to form continuous lines vertically and horizontally until they either reach the edge or another number. Where these lines cross, the cell gets filled with `2`.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
- The `8` is located at `[1][4]`.
- The `7` is located at `[6][1]`.

The `8` should spread to form a vertical and horizontal line:
- Vertically from `[1][4]` to `[8][4]`
- Horizontally from `[1][0]` to `[1][8]`

Similarly, the `7` should spread:
- Vertically from `[6][1]` to `[8][1]`
- Horizontally from `[6][0]` to `[6][8]`

Where these lines intersect, we fill with `2`. The intersection will occur at `[1][1]` and `[6][4]`.

Putting this together, the result would look like this:

```python
Answer: [
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],

f8b3ba0a,"First, we can observe that in all given input grids, there are rows of zeros interspersed with rows containing blocks of non-zero integers. The non-zero integers represent different colors.

The output consists of a small grid where each row contains just one number. This suggests that the transformation rule likely involves selecting a single color value from each group of colored blocks in the input grid.

To find out the rule, let's analyze how the output numbers relate to the input grids. Looking at the first example, the output is `[[4], [2], [3]]`. The numbers 4, 2, and 3 appear in the input grid. However, they don't seem to be the most frequent colors or the top ones in the grid. Instead, they appear to be the highest numbered colors from each set of colored blocks.

Let's apply this observation to the other training examples:

- In Example 2, the highest numbered non-zero colors within their groups are 6, 1, and 2.
- For Example 3, the colors are 2, 8, and 1.
- In Example 4, the highest numbered colors are 8, 2, and 4.

From these patterns, it appears that the transformation rule is to pick the highest numbered color found within each group of colored blocks in the input grid and place it into a respective row in the output grid.

Applying the identified rule to the test case:

- The highest numbered colors from the groups in the test case are 8, 4, 1, and 4 respectively.

Therefore, the answer should contain the sequence of these highest numbers, one per row:

6e82a1ae,"To determine the transformation rule, let's first observe patterns across all given training examples.

In every instance:
- The value 0 in the input remains 0 in the output.
- The value 5 in the input gets replaced by another value, either 1, 2, or 3 in the output. 
- The new values appear to be grouping certain connected regions of 5s into separate blocks.

Based on these observations, the transformation seems to be a form of labeling distinct connected regions of 5s with unique identifiers (1, 2, 3) in the output.

Let's now apply this reasoning to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Identifying connected regions of 5s:
- The top-right edge has a continuous line of 5s.
- There are two separate groups in the middle.
- At the bottom left corner, there is also a connected group of 5s.

Labeling these groups uniquely with 1, 2, 3:
- The top-right edge (including the vertical line): label with 1
- The left middle group: label with 2
- The right middle group: label with 3
- The bottom left group: label with 4

Test Case Output:
```

a3325580,"Analyzing the provided examples, we can identify a pattern in the transformation from input to output.

1. In each transformation, we see the output is a grid containing only non-zero unique colors present in the input grid.
2. The output grid is composed of these distinct colors, listed in the order they appear from left to right and top to bottom. If there are multiple columns or rows of the same color, they are represented only once in the output.
3. The output grid size does not necessarily match the input grid size; instead, it reflects the number of distinct non-zero colors found in the input.

Let's apply this understanding to the test case:

```python
input_grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],

```

In this grid, the non-zero, unique colors are 1, 5, 9, and 8, 2.

The output should therefore be a grid listing these colors, one per row, since they are all distinct and do not form columns or rows of repeated values that would require additional representation.

a87f7484,"Upon analyzing the transformation patterns between the input and output grids provided in the training examples, we can identify the following rule:

1. The transformation appears to focus on the 'outer' or most frequent color in each block of rows that share the same color pattern when ignoring zeros.
2. Each block's final representation in the output is the smallest 3x3 grid formed by the most frequent (or outer) color in those rows.
3. In each example, we observe that the largest continuous block of rows with the same non-zero color, ignoring zeros, is selected and its 3x3 grid representation is used in the output.

Based on these observations, let us apply this rule to the test case:

The test case consists of several blocks:
- `[[0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0]]` - Outer color: 5
- `[[0, 3, 0], [3, 0, 3], [0, 3, 0]]` - Outer color: 3
- `[[6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6]]` - Outer color: 6
- `[[0, 4, 0], [4, 0, 4], [0, 4, 0]]` - Outer color: 4
- `[[0, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8], [0, 8, 0]]` - Outer color: 8

Among these blocks, we choose the one with the highest frequency of outer appearances:
- Color 5 appears once,
- Color 3 appears once,
- Color 6 appears once,
- Color 4 appears once,
- Color 8 appears once.

Since all colors appear an equal number of times, we can take the last appearing color (which is 8) as per the pattern seen in the examples provided.

Thus, the output should be:

95990924,"To identify the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples.

In all examples, the transformation adds a pattern of new numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) around existing blocks of numbers (like `5`). These new numbers seem to be placed in a manner that creates a border or frame around the original number blocks. Each block of `5`s has numbers `1` and `2` on opposite sides (horizontally) and numbers `3` and `4` on opposite sides (vertically). It appears that the numbers are added only if the original block of `5`s does not extend to the edge of the grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test input:

The test input contains several blocks of `5`s:
- Two blocks at the top row
- One block in the middle column
- Another block towards the bottom

Using the identified rule, we add the numbers `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` around each of these blocks, except where they would extend beyond the grid edges. Here is the computed result:

f2829549,"To establish the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples provided:

In each input grid, there seem to be several key elements: numbers like `7`, `1`, `5`, and zeros. Looking at the pattern in the outputs, the following observations can be made:
- The output grids are considerably smaller than the input grids.
- Each output grid appears to be a 4x3 grid.
- In the output grid, only `0` and `3` are used.
- The number `3` appears to represent some specific condition or presence of a certain combination of numbers in the input.

Upon closer inspection, it seems `3`s appear in locations that correspond to columns in the input where a specific vertical pattern (or set of patterns) involving the numbers `7`, `1`, and `5` exists. It looks like the transformation involves looking at vertical patterns in columns of the input grid and deciding based on those if the corresponding cell in the output should be `0` or `3`.

For the test case:
```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0],
[7, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0],
[7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5]]
```

We need to apply the same pattern recognition. The output should be a 4x3 grid. Here’s how we can break it down:

- For the first column (all zeros in the input), no significant pattern is detected; hence, the corresponding cells in the output should be zeros.
- For the second column, the vertical pattern `[7, 7, 0, 0]` may indicate a specific condition not leading to `3`.
- For the third column, similar reasoning applies as the second column.
- Fourth column has a persistent `1` throughout which might not lead to `3`.
- Fifth column's pattern `[0, 5, 5, 5]` might lead to a `3` in one of the rows.
- Sixth column's pattern `[5, 5, 0, 5]` might also lead to a `3`.
- Seventh column does not contain significant numbers like `7` or `5`.

543a7ed5,"To solve the puzzle, we need to observe the changes made from the input grids to the output grids and derive a consistent transformation rule. Here's the step-by-step reasoning based on the provided examples:

1. **Identifying Color Changes**:
   - The color `6` in the input often transforms into a combination of `3`, `4`, and `6` in the output.
   - Specifically, `6` cells often have `3`s surrounding them or filling the spaces around the `6` blocks.

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The transformation seems to add borders or fill gaps with `3` and sometimes `4`.
   - If `6` is present, `3`s are used to form a border or fill a space that wasn't previously filled by any specific pattern.
   - The `4`s seem to be placed within the blocks where `6` transitions into `3`.

Based on these observations, here's how the transformation rule can be applied to the given test case:

- Start with the entire grid consisting of `8`s except for the `6`s.
- Surround the `6` blocks with `3`s to create borders.
- Fill in the middle areas with `4`s to maintain the integrity of those blocks.

794b24be,"To solve the puzzle and find the transformation rule applied in these examples, let's analyze the changes observed:

- In all given examples, the integer values `1` in the input grid are consistently transformed to `2` in the output.
- The `0`s in the input remain unchanged as `0`s in the output.
- It looks like the transformation affects only the top row and possibly the second row if they contain adjacent `1`s that form a continuous path horizontally or vertically.

By examining the examples closely, we can see that the transformation seems to apply a flood fill algorithm starting from the top row, where any `1` in contact with another `1` horizontally or vertically will be transformed into `2`.

For the test case:
``` 
[
[0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0]]
```

Following the identified pattern (and considering the continuous path of `1`s):
- The `1` at position `[0][1]` will transform into `2`.
- The `1` at position `[2][1]` is not connected to the `1` above it horizontally or vertically in the top two rows, so it won't be affected by the transformation.

Applying this knowledge to the test case:

3f7978a0,"In order to identify the transformation rule applied to the grid, let's analyze the differences between the input and output in the provided examples.

1. **Size Comparison**: The size of the output grids is smaller than their corresponding input grids. In Example 1, the input grid is 9x9, and its output grid is 5x5. In Example 2, the input grid is 9x11, and its output grid is 5x7. In Example 3, the input grid is 11x13, yet the output grid is 6x5.
   
2. **Symmetry Analysis**: Each output grid shows a sort of symmetry with respect to the central row and column. For instance, in Example 1, the center is at position (3,3) and the numbers around this point seem to form symmetric patterns.

3. **Pattern Identification**: Upon closer inspection, the central column and row of the output grid align with the pattern of non-zero numbers that run vertically and horizontally through the center of the input grid. This suggests that the output grid only picks these central elements and possibly surrounding key non-zero elements to maintain the pattern.

Given this analysis, the transformation rule appears to be extracting a central sub-grid from the input while focusing on maintaining the symmetry and critical non-zero pattern.

**Test Case Solution**:

Looking at the test case input grid, we can find the central vertical and horizontal lines and the surrounding key non-zero elements to construct our output grid.

The central column in the test case input grid is the 6th column, and the central row is the 7th row. Thus, we extract these and some adjacent non-zero patterns:

- From the 6th column, take non-zero elements and their symmetrically placed neighbors.
- From the 7th row, include similar elements.

We'll get the following output grid:

dc433765,"To determine the transformation rule applied in the examples, let's closely examine how the input grids are converted into the output grids.

In all given examples, the non-zero elements (colors) move vertically to make their row index equal to half of the grid's height (rounded down), if possible, while maintaining their column positions.

For example:
- In Example 1, the number 3, originally at row 0, moves to row 1 (half of 3 rows rounded down is 1).
- In Example 2, the numbers 3 and 4, originally at row 1, move to row 2 (half of 5 rows rounded down is 2).

This pattern repeats in other examples where non-zero numbers move vertically towards the middle row of the grid.

Based on this observation, we can apply the same rule to our test case.

The test case has a grid with 11 rows and 11 columns. Half of 11 rows rounded down is 5. Therefore, any non-zero elements should be moved to the 5th row (index 4 since indexing starts from 0).

25d487eb,"Upon analyzing the provided examples, the transformation rule seems to be that any ""islands"" or ""blobs"" of non-zero numbers are expanded to fill their entire row from the point where they start until the end of the row. Additionally, if there are other islands of different numbers in the same row, they do not interfere with each other's expansion.

For the test case grid:
- There is an island of `4`s and one of `8` on the bottom right.
- The `4`s start filling from column 3 in row 11 and continue to the right.
- The `8` is surrounded by `4`s and does not expand beyond its own cell.

42a50994,"To determine the transformation rule applied in the provided examples, let's examine the changes made between the inputs and corresponding outputs.

**Observations:**
1. In all transformations, the color `8` in Example 1, `6` in Example 2, `5` in Example 3, and `4` in Example 4 become `0` whenever they are not surrounded by at least one instance of the same color horizontally or vertically.
2. This rule seems to apply only to the specific color present in each example (`8, 6, 5, 4`), and other colors (like `0`) remain unchanged.
3. For any grid transformation, the process involves checking each cell with the specific color and removing it if it doesn't have any adjacent neighbors of the same color (i.e., directly above, below, left, or right).

**Rule Summary:**
- If a cell contains the color specific to the example (`8`, `6`, `5`, `4`), it remains only if it has at least one adjacent neighbor (horizontally or vertically) with the same color. Otherwise, the cell is set to `0`.

Let's apply this summary rule to the test case.

The color of interest in the test case is `3`. We'll check every cell containing `3` and see whether it has an adjacent `3`; if not, we'll convert that `3` to `0`.

In Example 1:
The two clusters of 2s and the 4s and 1s have been moved above the row of zeros, aligning them in the smallest possible space where there isn't any other color.

In Example 2:
Several clusters of different colors are moved upwards so that they occupy the lowest non-zero rows. The clusters are aligned so that there are no gaps between them in the vertical direction.

In Example 3:
Similar to the previous cases, the clusters of 1s, 2s, and 4s are moved upwards, but they maintain their horizontal positions relative to each other. Any empty rows between the clusters of colors are removed.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule can be formulated as follows:

- Identify all distinct, contiguous clusters of colors.
- Move all identified clusters of colors upwards to the top of the grid, preserving their shape and relative horizontal position.
- Remove any empty rows that were left behind after moving the clusters.

Applying this transformation rule to the test case:

```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],  # Cluster of 2s
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],  # Cluster of 2s
[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],  # Cluster of 1s and separate cluster of 2s
[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Cluster of 1s

db3e9e38,"To deduce the transformation rule from the provided examples, we need to compare the input and output grids.

1. **Observation on the pattern**: Each output grid contains additional numbers (8 and 7) in such a way that they create a sort of ""wave"" or ""ripple"" effect around the central column of 7s present in the input grids. The pattern seems to spread outwards from the central column of 7s, alternating between 7 and 8.

2. **Detailed analysis**:
    - In Example 1, the central column of 7s spreads outwards with alternating 8s and 7s.
    - In Example 2, the third column of 7s spreads outwards similarly, creating a ripple effect.

3. **General rule**: It appears that every cell in the output grid is filled with either 7 or 8, starting from the central column of 7s and spreading outwards. The pattern alternates such that every other cell outside the central column is populated with 8s, while the rest are 7s, creating a checkerboard-like pattern.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- The test case starts with a central column of 7s in the 6th column.
- We extend the alternating 7 and 8 pattern outwards from this column.

39a8645d,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. The input grid is larger than the output one and consists mainly of zeros.
2. The numbers in the output grid seem to correspond to particular numbers in the input grid that form smaller, specific patterns.
3. In each output grid, a smaller 3x3 square appears containing numbers found in the input grid.

Let's try to identify the rule from these observations:
- Each output is a 3x3 grid.
- It seems the numbers 8, 4, and 3 appear in the output when they form certain patterns in the input.
- These patterns are not random; they tend to cluster around certain rows and columns in the input grid.

For Example 1, the number 8 forms the pattern:
- [8, 0, 8]
- [0, 8, 0]
- [8, 0, 8]

This pattern suggests a focus on a central subset of rows and columns.

Applying this to the Test Case:
- The numbers 3 and 2 form clusters in the input grid.
- Focusing on the central part of the input grid where 3s and 2s appear most densely:
  - Row 3-5, Col 4-6 for the number 3.
  - Row 9-11, Col 1-3 for the number 2.
  
By focusing on the central region where the numbers 3 and 2 form a dense pattern, we can extract the following 3x3 square:

``` 
[0, 3, 0]
[3, 3, 2]
[0, 2, 0]

7e0986d6,"To transform the given input grid into the output grid, we can observe that the numbers other than zeroes (e.g., 8's in Example 1 and 2's in Example 2) are being replaced by the most frequent number within their immediate vicinity (horizontally or vertically). This suggests that the transformation rule could involve smoothing out the non-zero numbers by replacing them with the majority value found in their neighborhood.

Applying this concept to the test case:

- We need to replace every non-zero number with the most common non-zero number in its row and column.
- If there are no conflicts (i.e., the most common number is the same both horizontally and vertically), then replace accordingly.
- Zeros remain untouched.

Let's analyze the test case step-by-step to deduce the output.

### Analyzing Test Case

1. In general, the numbers 4 and 5 are present in the grid, and 4 appears less frequently than 5.
2. The zeros should remain unchanged.
3. Any number 4 or 5 should be checked to see if its neighbors predominantly have the same number.

#### Grid Analysis:

The first few rows:
```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 4, 5, 0]
[0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
```
- The 4's in these rows are surrounded by mostly 5's, so they should be replaced with 5's.

d13f3404,"To derive the rule from the training examples, let's analyze the transformations step-by-step:

1. **Grid Size Increase**: Each output grid has dimensions (n+5) x (n+5) where 'n' is the original grid size. For instance, in the first example, the input is 3x3 and the output is 6x6.

2. **Pattern Identification**: Notice that the numbers from the input grid seem to be shifted diagonally towards the bottom right corner in the output. This suggests a movement and replication pattern where each element moves down-right while replicating into an increasingly larger grid.

3. **Movement and Replication Rule**: Let’s break down the shift and replication rule more accurately:
   - The top-left number (if not zero) starts the sequence.
   - Each non-zero number from the input grid appears in the output grid on a diagonal moving towards the bottom-right, with each new row and column adding zeroes to maintain the structure and space for future numbers.

By understanding this rule, we can determine the output for the test case.

**Test Case Analysis:**
Input:
```[
[0, 0, 3],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 4, 9]
]```

Applying the identified rule:
- The 3 moves down-right in the output, filling in diagonals.
- The 4 and 9 follow their respective paths accordingly.

Following the pattern, the output should look like this:
- The 3 starts at [2][0] in the output grid and shifts down-right.
- The 4 starts at [2][1] and follows the same shifting rule.
- The 9 starts at [2][2] and follows the shifting rule.

99fa7670,"To solve this puzzle, we need to observe the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid across all provided examples.

From the examples given:

- In Example 1, the number `2` spread to the right and down until it met another number or edge.
- In Example 2, the number `6` spread first to the right and then downwards.
- Example 3 shows similar behavior where `8` spread right and down, and `5` did the same.
- In Example 4, numbers `8`, `7`, and `6` all spread right and down, following the same rule.

The transformation seems to involve filling the grid to the right and downward of a non-zero value until hitting another non-zero value or the edge of the grid. This indicates that each non-zero number fills in empty cells to its right and below it, stopping when it encounters either an edge or another filled cell.

Following this rule on the test case:

1. The `8` at position (0,3) spreads right and down until it meets the end of the grid.
2. The `7` at position (2,2) spreads right and down, stopping when it meets the edge or another number.
3. The `2` at position (4,5) spreads right and down, stopping when it meets the edge or another number.

Applying these rules, the transformed grid for the test case should look like:

Firstly, let's observe the examples:

- In Example 1, we see that the non-zero rows in the input grid are rearranged in the output grid such that the row with the lowest color value (non-zero) appears first, followed by rows with higher values. Rows with entirely zero values are moved to the top.
- In Example 2, the same rule applies. Non-zero rows are sorted by their lowest non-zero value, and all-zero rows are moved to the top.
- In Example 3, again, rows are sorted based on their lowest non-zero value, pushing all-zero rows to the top.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
1. Sort the rows in ascending order based on the smallest non-zero value found in each row.
2. Move any rows that are completely zeroes to the top of the grid.

zero_rows = [row for row in input_grid if sum(row) == 0]
non_zero_rows = [row for row in input_grid if sum(row) > 0]

# Sort non-zero rows based on the lowest non-zero value
sorted_non_zero_rows = sorted(non_zero_rows, key=lambda x: min([n for n in x if n != 0]))

# Combine the lists with all-zeroes rows first, followed by sorted non-zero rows

4522001f,"To solve this puzzle, I'll analyze the pattern in the training examples to discover the transformation rule applied to each.

Step 1: Observing the dimensions.
In each example, the output is a 9x9 grid while the inputs are smaller. This suggests that the transformation scales up the given patterns within the input to fit into a larger grid.

Step 2: Identifying the pattern replication.
I notice that the non-zero elements in each input get expanded to fill larger areas in the output. Specifically, they replicate in a block-like manner. In Example 1, the 3s in the top left of the input become a 4x4 block of 3s at the top left of the output. Similarly, the 2 becomes a 4x4 block of 2s in the center, and so on.

Step 3: Applying the rule to the test case.
For the test case provided, we need to apply the same logic: expand the non-zero blocks proportionately to fill the 9x9 grid:

- The top left 2x2 block of 3s should become a 3x3 block of 3s in the top left of the output.
- The 2 in the middle of row 2 should expand into a 3x3 block of 2s in the middle of the grid.
- The remaining 3s should form another 3x3 block right below the 2s.

Thus, the solution involves filling in these blocks according to their original positions in the input and expanding them appropriately.

1f0c79e5,"To find the transformation rule applied in these puzzles, let's look at what changes have occurred between the inputs and outputs in the provided examples.

1. Each output grid features a sequence of numbers that radiate out from the initial number in the input grid to form an ""upside down"" triangle pattern.
2. In all cases, once the first non-zero number appears in the input grid, the corresponding location in the output grid serves as the top vertex of an upside-down triangle. This triangle expands outward, layer by layer, with the number filling the spaces.
3. If two starting points are close enough (like in Example 3 where there are 6s and 2s), they can influence each other's growth, resulting in the triangles merging into one larger triangle.

Based on this reasoning, we can now apply this pattern to the test case. We see that the center of the triangle should start from the position where the number 8 appears in the test case input grid. From there, it should radiate outwards to form a triangle shape with the number 8 at the top and expanding with 2s around it.

Applying this rule to the test case:

2bee17df,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the provided examples.

1. In all examples, the outermost border remains unchanged, indicating that the transformation does not affect the outer edges.
2. The number `0` is replaced with `3` if surrounded by any numbers except `2`, and sometimes when surrounded only by `8`s, but not when next to `2`. This implies that the transformation applies a specific coloring rule based on neighboring cells.
3. The number `2` is never replaced and serves as a kind of boundary or barrier between areas colored `3`.

Given these observations, we can hypothesize that the transformation rule works as follows:

- For each cell containing a `0`, check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).
- Replace the `0` with a `3` if it is surrounded by any combination of `8`s and/or other `0`s and is not adjacent to a `2`.
- Leave the `0` unchanged if it's adjacent to a `2`.
- Leave the existing colors (other than `0`) untouched.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

1. Start with the first `0` in the second row, fourth column. It is surrounded by `8`s and another `0` so it transforms to `3`.
2. Continue this logic for all zeros in the grid, ensuring the `2`s act as barriers.

1. The output of each transformation is a single cell grid.
2. By looking at several examples, I observe that the single cell value in the output corresponds to the most frequent color (integer) present in the input grid. If there is a tie for the most frequent color, it seems like zero is favored over other colors.

Let's analyze the frequency of each color in the test case input grid:

- Color 0 appears 13 times.
- Color 2 appears 7 times.
- Color 8 appears 16 times.

Since color 8 is the most frequent, we would expect the output to be a grid with a single cell containing the number 8.

d4469b4b,"To understand the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the training examples:

1. **Observation on Input Patterns:** The input grids typically have non-zero numbers scattered across the grid with some kind of symmetry or pattern, while zeros are used as filler.

2. **Output Grids:** All output grids reduce the input to a 3x3 grid where:
   - The value `5` appears in a certain pattern.
   - Zeros (`0`) fill other positions.

3. **Pattern Identification:** The core pattern seems to involve detecting the middle row and column of the larger grid and setting these positions to `5`. The rest of the pattern around the core seems to depend on the presence of the original numbers and their positioning.

From the examples provided:
- Example 1 shows a cross pattern in the middle of the input which is reduced to a cross pattern of `5` in the output.
- Example 2 shows a T-shaped pattern that is reduced similarly.
- Example 3 and 7 reveal a more central focus on vertical/horizontal lines in an L-shape which is transformed into a vertical/horizontal line pattern in the output.
- Example 4 and 5 show similar transformations with a central cross being the key pattern.

Based on these observations, it seems the transformation focuses on the central part of the input, particularly a 3x3 subgrid centered around the middle of the input grid. 

For the test input:

```
The middle positions of this input grid would be:
```plaintext
[0, 1, 0],
[1, 0, 0],

90f3ed37,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the corresponding output grids, let's analyze the changes between the examples provided.

The common pattern across all examples seems to be the addition of the value `1` in certain positions within the grid. Specifically, these `1`s are placed right below the bottom-most row of `8`s in a specific column where an `8` appears for the first time.

Let's break down the steps:

1. Identify the bottom-most row of `8`s in each column.
2. Below that bottom-most `8`, insert `1`s in the cells where there are no `8`s, continuing until the end of the grid or another `8` is encountered.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

- The first non-zero column has `8`s at rows 1 and 3. Below the last `8` (row 3), we need to fill with `1`s.
- The second non-zero column has an `8` at row 1 and another at row 3. We again start filling with `1`s below the last `8` (row 3).
- The third non-zero column only has one `8` at row 2, so we fill below it.
- The fourth non-zero column starts with `8`s at rows 1 and 3, so we fill below them.

2. In Example 2, the color `7` starts at positions (3,5), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3) in the input grid. In the output grid, similar behavior can be observed where the colors spread diagonally and symmetrically.

3. In Example 3, the color `6` spreads similarly with an emphasis on symmetry across both axes and diagonals from the starting points.

Given this pattern, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves propagating the color from the starting points symmetrically along both axes and diagonals, filling the grid while maintaining the symmetry.

29623171,"To solve this puzzle, I will first determine the pattern or transformation that was applied to get from input to output in the provided examples.

Observations from Training Examples:

1. **Central Pattern:** The central pattern (the pattern inside the grid, excluding the boundaries) seems to remain mostly unchanged except for some changes in the corners and edges.
2. **Boundary and Edge Changes:** 
   - Any number other than `5` in the first and last columns and rows tends to be replaced with zeros, except when `2` and `3` numbers are present.
   - For numbers `2` and `3`, they spread to fill the entire row or column where they appear, until blocked by `5`.
   - The number `4` seems to be treated similarly to `3`.

Based on these observations, we can infer the transformation rule: non-`5` numbers in the boundary and edge positions tend to be removed unless they are `2` or `4`. In such cases, the non-zero value spreads horizontally or vertically up to the nearest `5`.

Applying this transformation rule to the Test Case:

The test case involves the number `4` which should spread horizontally or vertically up to the nearest `5`. The `4`s in the corners and edges will spread along the rows and columns until they hit a `5` or another `4`.

Given the test input, the transformation would look like this:

```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], # The 4's spread to fill their respective rows
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], # The middle 4 spreads to fill the row until 5
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], # The 4 spreads to fill the row until 5
[4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4], # All 4's spread to fill the row
[0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0]  # The 4's spread to fill the row

8d5021e8,"Let's analyze the transformation pattern in the provided training examples:

In Example 1, the pattern seems to involve expanding the given grid in both dimensions while duplicating elements according to certain rules.
- The original grid is 3x2, and the output is 9x4.
- Each element in the original grid is duplicated both horizontally and vertically according to the position in the grid.

Let's break down the process more clearly:
- The top-left element (0) is expanded to fill a 3x3 block.
- The second column, which alternates between 8 and 0, becomes a 3x3 block with 8s on the borders and 0s in the middle.
- The pattern repeats itself to form the entire 9x4 grid.

Similarly:
- In Example 2, the input is 3x2, and the output is 9x4.
- The element 2 is repeated in a similar manner to form a larger grid.

And:
- Example 3 also follows the same principle with an input of 3x2 leading to an output of 9x4.

Based on these observations, let's apply this method to the test case:

Test Case Input:
``` 
[
[3, 3],
[3, 0],
[3, 3]]
```

We need to expand this using the same duplication and replication method:
- The top-left element (3) needs to become a 3x3 area.
- The second column alternates 3 and 0, which similarly forms a 3x3 block with 3 on the borders and 0 in the middle.
- This pattern is repeated for all rows.

Constructing the grid:

First row (3):
```
[3, 3, 3, 3]
```
Second row (3):
```
[3, 0, 0, 3]
```
Third row (3):
```
[3, 3, 3, 3]
```

Repeat each row three times:

```
[3, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 3, 3]

[3, 0, 0, 3]

[3, 0, 0, 3]

b548a754,"By analyzing the transformations in the provided examples, we can discern the following pattern:

- The transformation involves expanding the colored regions to a certain extent, often resulting in the filling or spreading of colors horizontally and vertically.
- If there is an isolated color value that is surrounded by zeros (like the '8' in several examples), it remains unchanged unless it affects the spreading of adjacent colors.

Let's apply these observations to the test case.

Input for the test case:

[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

The '8' is isolated and does not spread. The '4' region expands to fill the gaps between the '6's, and the '6's expand to fill their own gaps. Here’s the expected output:

Output for the test case:
```plaintext

However, considering the rules applied in previous examples, the '4' region should spread more to fill the entire space between the '6' regions. Thus, the correct transformation would be:

27a28665,"To determine the transformation rule used to produce the output grids from the input grids, I will analyze the input and output pairs provided.

From observing the examples, we can notice that the output consists of a single number in a 1x1 grid. This number appears to count something specific about the patterns present in the input grids but does not directly represent any color value within the grids.

By comparing the input and output pairs:

- In Example 1 and Example 6, the pattern is a cross formed by `5` in the center and sides but with a different number of zeros around it. Both patterns result in an output of `[1]`.
- In Example 2, 3, and 4, we have symmetric arrangements around the middle, resulting in outputs of `[2]`, `[2]`, and `[3]` respectively.
- In Example 5, the arrangement resembles that of Example 4, yielding the same output of `[3]`.
- Example 7 has a more complex pattern with `5` surrounding a central area, which results in an output of `[6]`.

It seems the number in the output represents the count of distinct color regions or clusters of the main color in the grid (excluding zeros). For instance:
- A cross-like pattern with no zeros surrounding the center yields 1 region.
- Symmetric patterns with the main color around the center yield 2 or 3 regions, depending on complexity.
- More complex patterns that involve the main color forming larger areas yield more regions.

Given this logic, we need to count the distinct regions of the main color in the test case's grid:
```
[0, 8, 0]
[8, 8, 8]
[0, 8, 0]
```

In this pattern, the color `8` forms a single continuous region. Therefore, the output should correspond to the count of these regions, which is 1.

cdecee7f,"To determine the solution for the test case, I will analyze the pattern in the provided examples.

Firstly, notice that the output grids are 3x3. This suggests that the transformation involves selecting specific elements from the input grid and reorganizing them into a smaller 3x3 grid.

In all examples:
- The non-zero numbers are being extracted.
- They are arranged in a 3x3 grid, starting from the top-left corner and moving left-to-right and top-to-bottom.

For Example 1:
The non-zero numbers are 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9. These are placed into a 3x3 grid in this order.

For Example 2:
The non-zero numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. These are placed into a 3x3 grid in this order.

For Example 3:
The numbers 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 9 are found and similarly placed into a 3x3 grid.

Following this same pattern, let's extract the non-zero numbers from the test case and place them into a 3x3 grid.

Test Case:
Non-zero numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.

Thus, the output should be:
``` [[2, 5, 9], [6, 3, 4], [1, 0, 0]] ```

This arrangement comes from taking the numbers in the order they appear and filling in the 3x3 grid left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

b60334d2,"To identify the transformation rule used in the provided examples, we need to carefully inspect the differences between the input and output grids.

Observation from Example 1: 
- Cells containing '5' have been surrounded by '1's and '5's in a checkerboard pattern. Specifically, cells with '5' are surrounded by alternating '1's and '5's, creating a checkerboard effect around the '5'.
- This checkerboard pattern appears only when a '5' cell has an adjacent cell within the grid boundaries that could accommodate the pattern.

Observation from Example 2:
- Similar pattern formation around the '5' cells is observed. The checkerboard pattern is maintained, indicating that this pattern is the key transformation rule.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule can be described as follows:
- For each '5' in the input grid, apply a checkerboard pattern around it, extending to all reachable neighbors within the grid boundaries.
- The checkerboard pattern alternates between '1' and '5'.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```[

[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]```

Applying the checkerboard pattern around the '5's:
1. For the first '5' at position (1,1):
   - Surrounding cells form a checkerboard: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).

2. For the second '5' at position (3,4):
   - Surrounding cells form a checkerboard: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).

3. For the third '5' at position (5,7):
   - Surrounding cells form a checkerboard: (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8).

4. For the fourth '5' at position (7,2):
   - Surrounding cells form a checkerboard: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3).

5614dbcf,"To derive the transformation rule from the input to the output in the provided training examples, let's analyze both examples.

In Example 1, observe that the input is a 9x9 grid and the output is a 3x3 grid. Each cell in the output represents the middle color (if present) from a corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the input. If there is no consistent middle color or if the center cell has a unique value surrounded by different numbers, it appears as `0` in the output.

Similarly, in Example 2, we see the same pattern. The middle value of each 3x3 subgrid from the larger grid is taken and placed into the smaller grid, with `0` being used where no consistent middle color can be identified.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- For the first 3x3 subgrid:
```[[4, 4, 4], [5, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4]]```
The middle value is `4`.

- For the second 3x3 subgrid:
```[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0]]```
There is no consistent middle color, so it’s `0`.

- For the third 3x3 subgrid:
```[[0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]```
Again, no consistent middle color, so it’s `0`.

- For the fourth 3x3 subgrid:
```[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]```
There is no consistent middle color, so it’s `0`.

- For the fifth 3x3 subgrid:
```[[3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3]]```
The middle value is `3`.

- For the sixth 3x3 subgrid:
```[[0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]```
No consistent middle color, so it’s `0`.

- For the seventh 3x3 subgrid:
```[[0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]```
Again, no consistent middle color, so it’s `0`.

- For the eighth 3x3 subgrid:
```[[5, 9, 9], [0, 5, 9], [0, 9, 9]]```
The middle value is `5`.

- For the ninth 3x3 subgrid:

1. In Example 1, the 7x5 input was reduced to a 3x3 output. Note that:
    - The values in the output grid match the non-1 (non-background) values found in the middle sections of the input grid.
    - The positions seem to follow a pattern where only certain rows and columns are selected.

2. In Example 2, the 7x7 input was reduced to a 2x3 output. Here:
    - Again, the non-1 values from the middle section are used in the output grid.
    - Note the zeros in the output; they seem to replace areas where no non-1 values are present in the corresponding positions of the input.
  
3. In Example 3, the 6x6 input was reduced to a 3x2 output. This follows a similar pattern:
    - Only non-1 values are kept, and these are placed in their relative positions in the output grid.

In summary, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Reduce the dimensions of the grid by focusing on the central part and discarding the outermost layers.
- Replace all 1s with 0s, preserving only the original non-1 values.

- When an `8` is present in the same row or column as a `2`, a series of transformations occurs where the cells between the `2` and `8` are filled with `8`s, except directly next to the `2`. Instead, there is often one cell filled with a `4` right before the `8`s.

d631b094,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid contains a single non-zero value (1), which appears in the second row and first column. The output grid reduces this to a [1, 1] array. This suggests the output only includes unique non-zero values found in the input along with the count of occurrences.

2. In Example 2, the non-zero value is 2, which appears three times in distinct locations. The output is a grid with four 2s, indicating that the output includes all non-zero values found in the input but flattened into a single row with repetition equal to the number of occurrences.

3. In Example 3, there's a single non-zero value (7) in the first row and second column, leading to an output grid with just one 7.

4. In Example 4, the non-zero value is 8, which appears four times in various locations. The output is a grid with four 8s.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be that the output is a single row grid containing each non-zero value found in the input, repeated according to the number of its occurrences in the input grid.

Applying this rule to the Test case:
- The input grid has the non-zero value 4, which appears 5 times.
- Therefore, the output should contain five 4s in a single row.

1. **Size Increase**: Each output grid is expanded to twice the width and height of its corresponding input grid.
2. **Pattern Replication**: The pattern found in the input is replicated in a mirrored fashion both horizontally and vertically.

Let's break down the transformation rule further:

- The original input grid is replicated in a 2x2 grid pattern in the output grid, maintaining the same relative positions but mirrored on all sides.
  
Let's verify this with the training examples:

31aa019c,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the grid of numbers, let's carefully analyze the transformation that occurred in the provided training examples.

### Observations

#### Example 1:
- The non-zero values in the output grid form a rectangle in the middle, but only with the number `2` and `4`. Other numbers are not present in the output.
- Notice that some zeros in the input have been replaced by `2`s, indicating a potential flooding or filling effect starting from a specific point.

#### Example 2:
- In the output, only the number `2` and `6` remained, forming a rectangle centered around them. Other values were changed to zero.

#### Example 3:
- Similar to the previous examples, the output forms a rectangle with `2` and `3` in the center, and other numbers are not found.

### Common Pattern
Based on these observations, the transformation seems to involve:
- Replacing certain values with zeros.
- Filling a rectangular area around specific numbers from the input, likely the first occurrence of a non-zero value from left-to-right and top-to-bottom, with those non-zero values.

### Test Case Analysis:
Given the pattern we've identified, for our test case, we need to identify a central number and fill a rectangular area around it. Let's pick the first non-zero value from left-to-right and top-to-bottom which is `2`.

#### Steps to Apply Transformation:
1. Identify the first non-zero value.
2. Form a rectangle centered around the identified value, using its value to fill the rectangle.
3. Set all other values outside this rectangle to `0`.

In the test input, the first non-zero value from left-to-right and top-to-bottom is `2`, located at `[0][4]`. We can use this to form a rectangle in the output centered around `2`.

### Solution:
```python
Answer: [

    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],

7c008303,"To derive a transformation rule from the input to output grids as shown in the examples:

1. Each input grid is larger and contains more detailed information.
2. The output grids appear to summarize or condense parts of the input grids.
3. A pattern that stands out is that the output contains fewer rows and columns, hinting at some kind of reduction or mapping.
4. In the output, numbers that were part of large continuous blocks in the input are reduced to smaller blocks or singular values.
5. There is a consistent reduction in the horizontal and vertical dimensions from the inputs to outputs, but not a simple halving or doubling. Instead, it appears the output is derived by taking every nth value, where n is not consistent across all inputs but seems related to the size of the blocks and their positioning.

Analyzing the specific cases:
- Example 1 shows an input of 9x9, which is condensed to 6x6 in the output.
- Example 2 also starts with a 9x9 input and reduces to a 6x6 output.
- Example 3 follows the same pattern: a 9x9 input is mapped to a 6x6 output.

Given these observations, the rule seems to involve:
- Taking a subset of columns and rows from the input grid.
- Specifically, columns and rows containing significant colors (non-zero) are selected, while those with only zeros (or less significant patterns) are discarded or merged.

For the test case, we will apply a similar reduction strategy:
- Identify key columns and rows (those with non-zero colors) to preserve.
- Reduce the overall dimensions while maintaining the significant data.

Applying this logic:
```[
[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 7]]
```

The significant columns are columns 3, 4, 6, and 7; significant rows are 2-6, and the bottom row.

Thus, the solution based on the pattern observed would be:
```[
[0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0],
[3, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0],
[0, 3, 0, 3, 8, 0],

1. **Example 1**: 
   - Input grid is 3x3 with a central 2x2 block of 1s.
   - Output grid is 6x3. It consists of the original 3 rows, followed by 3 rows mirrored from the original (but not exactly; it's more like the original pattern repeated in reverse order).

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input grid is 3x3 with a different distribution of 1s and 0s.
   - Output grid is 6x3. It has the original 3 rows, followed by a reversed copy of the original pattern.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input grid is 3x3 with a vertical line of 1s.
   - Output grid is 6x3. Similar to previous examples, it has the original 3 rows followed by a reversed copy.

Looking at these examples, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

- The output grid is twice the size of the input grid (vertically doubled).
- The first half of the output grid is exactly the input grid.
- The second half of the output grid is a mirror image of the input grid, starting from the bottom row of the input and going up.

3. Any adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically) that share the same color are also filled with that same number in the output grid, forming a continuous area.

Given these observations, we can transform the test case accordingly:

- Start with replacing all `0`s with `3`s.

05269061,"To solve the problem, let's analyze the pattern in the transformation of the example grids.

In all three provided examples, the transformation involves repeating a sequence of numbers across the entire grid. Each sequence is determined by the non-zero elements in the first few rows or columns of the input grid.

Let's break down the process:

1. Identify the non-zero elements at the top left corner of the input grid.
2. Determine the repeating sequence based on these non-zero elements.
3. Apply this sequence in a cycle to fill the entire output grid.

For Example 1, the sequence starts with [2, 8, 3].
For Example 2, the sequence starts with [2, 4, 1] (the sequence is found from the bottom right corner).
For Example 3, the sequence starts with [4, 8, 3].

Applying this logic to the test case:

The non-zero elements that appear first in the grid are 1, 2, and 4. Given the positions of these numbers, we can infer the sequence as [1, 2, 4].
We will apply this sequence cyclically to fill the entire grid.

Starting with [1, 2, 4], the output will look like:
```
[1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1]
[2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2]

cf98881b,"To determine the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's analyze the transition from the input to the output in each of the training examples.

Upon observation, we can infer that the transformation involves selecting a specific subset of columns from the input grid based on a pattern and reducing the width of the grid. Specifically, it appears that only the first four columns of the input grid are preserved in the output. However, the exact mapping might involve some manipulation within those selected columns as well.

Let's break down the patterns seen in the transformation:

- The rows remain intact without shuffling.
- Each output has exactly four columns.
- There seems to be a focus on retaining certain values in the first four columns of the input grid.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule appears to be taking the first four columns of the input grid and possibly applying some local adjustments to the numbers present.

b1948b0a,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the given input and output grids:

In Example 1, the number `6` in the input grid is consistently replaced with `2` in the output grid, while the `7`s remain unchanged.

In Example 2, we see the same pattern: all instances of `6` are replaced with `2`, and `7`s stay the same.

In Example 3, the pattern continues; `6` is changed to `2`, and `7` stays as `7`.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule is to replace all `6` values with `2` in the input grid, leaving other numbers (such as `7`) as they are.

Applying this transformation rule to the test case:

Test Input:
``` 
[
[6, 7, 7, 6],
[6, 7, 6, 7],
[7, 7, 7, 6],
[7, 6, 7, 6]
]
```

We'll replace all `6`s with `2`s:
- First row: `[6, 7, 7, 6]` becomes `[2, 7, 7, 2]`
- Second row: `[6, 7, 6, 7]` becomes `[2, 7, 2, 7]`
- Third row: `[7, 7, 7, 6]` becomes `[7, 7, 7, 2]`
- Fourth row: `[7, 6, 7, 6]` becomes `[7, 2, 7, 2]`

Therefore, the transformed test output should be:

d0f5fe59,"To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Observation of Pattern**: The transformation seems to reduce a larger grid into a smaller one by identifying the non-zero elements (colored elements) in the original grid and mapping their positions into a new smaller grid. 

2. **Non-Zero Element Positions**: In each example, the non-zero elements seem to be placed at the corners or edges of the original grid and are being mapped to a smaller square grid.

3. **Mapping Rule**: By looking closely at the examples, we can see that each non-zero element is mapped to a corresponding position in the new grid based on its relative placement in the original grid's structure:
    - Example 1: The non-zero elements are scattered across the corners and middle rows/columns of the larger grid.
    - Example 2: Similar mapping but in a different layout pattern.
    - Example 3: Non-zero elements are more centrally positioned, still mapping to the corners of the smaller grid.

4. **Deduction of Final Grid Size**: From the examples, it seems that the final grid size depends on the maximum extent of the non-zero elements in both the x and y directions:
    - For example 1, the output is a 4x4 grid.
    - For example 2, the output is a 3x3 grid.
    - For example 3, the output is a 2x2 grid.

5. **Placement of Elements**: The non-zero elements are placed in the smaller grid according to their relative positions in the larger grid. If an element is found in the i-th row and j-th column of the larger grid, it will appear in the corresponding position in the smaller grid.

6. **Application to Test Case**:
    - The test case contains non-zero elements scattered across the grid.
    - To find the output grid size, we look at the extent of these non-zero elements in the x and y directions. The maximum extent in the test case suggests a 3x3 grid.
    - Mapping the non-zero elements directly based on their relative positions:
        - Position (2,9): Maps to (1,2)
        - Positions (3,5): Maps to (1,1)
        - Positions (3,8-9): Maps to (1,2)-(1,3)
        - Position (4,3-5): Maps to (2,1)-(2,2)
        - Positions (9,2-3): Maps to (3,1)-(3,2)
        - Position (10,7-8): Maps to (3,3)

The resulting transformation would yield a 3x3 grid as follows:

```Answer: 
[
[0, 8, 8],
[8, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 8]]

4258a5f9,"To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern used to transform the input into the output in the provided examples.

Observation from Example 1 and Example 2:
1. In both cases, the number `5` acts as a focal point.
2. Around each `5`, the surrounding cells that were previously `0`s become `1`s.
3. This transformation includes a 3x3 area around each `5`, but doesn't extend beyond the edges of the grid.

Let's apply this rule to the ""Test"" input:

1. Locate all `5`s in the Test input grid.
2. For each `5`, change the surrounding 3x3 area that includes itself to `1`s, except the original `5`s which remain `5`.

Applying the rule to the Test input:
- There is a `5` at position (1, 1) in the second row.
- There is a `5` at position (2, 7) in the third row.
- There is a `5` at position (4, 3) in the fifth row.
- There are `5`s at positions (7, 1) and (7, 5) in the eighth row.

6d75e8bb,"To determine the transformation rule from the provided examples, let's examine what changes occurred:

1. **Identify the pattern:** In all examples, there is a specific color (represented by `8`) that remains unchanged, and another color (`2`) is inserted in places where it seems the original patterns are extending or filling in gaps.

2. **Rule Identification:** It appears that wherever there is an isolated `8` surrounded by `0`s, `2`s are used to connect the isolated `8s` to their neighboring `8s`. This can be thought of as a kind of 'filling' process where gaps between `8`s are closed using `2`s.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- We start with the test case input and look for isolated `8`s that could potentially be connected.
- We see a series of `8`s forming a somewhat scattered pattern, and we need to add `2`s where needed to connect them logically, according to the previous examples.

Given this understanding, let's fill in the blanks with `2`s as necessary:

e50d258f,"To solve the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns we observe in the provided training examples:

1) **Pattern Observation**: In every example, there are parts of the grid filled with zeros. These zeros essentially form a border or padding around a more colorful core. The transformation involves removing this outer layer of zeros to expose the colorful core.

2) **Core Identification**: To identify the colorful core, find the smallest rectangle that contains all non-zero numbers (this includes numbers between 1 and 9). This rectangle's boundaries can be defined by the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost non-zero elements.

3) **Application of Core Identification**:
    - For Example 1, the core starts at row 1, column 1 and ends at row 5, column 9.
    - For Example 2, the core starts at row 1, column 3 and ends at row 4, column 7.
    - For Example 3, the core starts at row 0, column 0 and ends at row 5, column 3.

4) **Transformation Application**: Crop the grid to only include the identified core area.

Let's apply this rule to our test case to determine the core area and crop accordingly:

The test case grid is:

```[[2, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

 [0, 1, 2, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]```

- Top boundary: Row 0 (first non-zero row)
- Bottom boundary: Row 4 (last non-zero row considering all columns have a zero after this row)
- Left boundary: Column 0 (first non-zero column)
- Right boundary: Column 9 (last non-zero column)

By cropping the grid to this core area, we get:

```[[2, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

In each example, we see that the number `5` in the input leads to a block or series of `1`s in the output. The blocks of `1`s seem to extend horizontally leftwards and vertically upwards from each `5`. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Each `5` in the input causes a block of `1`s.
2. The block extends horizontally leftward to include all cells until the edge of the matrix or another block.
3. Similarly, it extends vertically upwards including all cells until the top or another block.
4. When there are multiple `5`s, their blocks may overlap, resulting in larger blocks of `1`s.

Given these rules, we can apply them to the test case:

- The `5` at `[1][7]` forms a block extending to the left and upwards.
- The `5` at `[4][1]` forms a block extending upwards and to the left.
- The `5` at `[4][7]` forms a block extending upwards and to the left.
- The `5` at `[7][1]` forms a block extending upwards and to the left.

caa06a1f,"To solve the test case, let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples.

In Example 1, the pattern in the input alternates between two numbers (6 and 7) in the first half of the grid before transitioning into a uniform color (3) for the remaining rows. In the output, the alternating pattern is preserved but flipped horizontally so that the starting sequence of each row is reversed. Additionally, the entire grid adopts this alternating pattern, eliminating the uniform color section.

Similarly, in Example 2, the alternating pattern between 3 and 6 is flipped for all rows, while the number 1 present at the end of some rows in the input is replaced by a continuation of the alternating pattern to fill the entire grid.

In Example 3, there is an alternating pattern of 4s and 5s with the addition of 6s in the last row. The output reverses the alternating pattern within the entire grid, removing the 6s altogether.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves reversing the order of the alternating pattern for all rows and filling the entire grid with this new pattern, effectively eliminating any uniform color sections or outliers (like the 3s and 6s).

Applying this rule to the test case:

The alternating pattern in the test case input is between 8, 5, and 7 before it transitions into a uniform color (3). The pattern should be reversed horizontally for all rows, and the uniform section also changes to fit the alternating pattern.

Thus, the solution for the test case would be:

05f2a901,"To solve this transformation puzzle, let's analyze the provided examples.

**Observations:**
- In all examples, there are blocks of numbers (like '2' or '8') that are present in certain rows but not in others.
- The transformation seems to involve moving these blocks downwards within the grid.
- Blocks seem to be moved down until they encounter another block or the bottom of the grid. They stack together based on their position in the original grid.

Let's break down the steps based on these observations:

1. Identify all non-zero elements (i.e., '2' and '8') in each column of the grid.
2. Shift these blocks downward so that they fill the gaps below them, stacking only when necessary.
3. Keep the zeros as placeholders where no other blocks would naturally fill due to the movement of other blocks.

For the test case:
1. Identify the positions of '2's and '8's in the input grid:
   - '2' appears in several rows around the middle of the grid.
   - '8' appears in two rows near the top of the grid.

2. Apply the observed rule to shift blocks downward, stacking them if necessary:
   - '8's should move down to the first available row, avoiding overlapping with '2's.
   - '2's should also move down, stacking only when there is no space for them to move further down without overlapping.

Following this rule, we get the transformed grid as follows:

d8c310e9,"To derive the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the provided examples.

### Observations:
- In Example 1, the bottom two rows of the output have been filled with a repeating pattern of `2, 2` and `1, 2, 2, 1`.
- In Example 2, only non-zero elements on the left side of the grid have been mirrored across the vertical axis to fill the right side of the grid.
- In Example 3, similar to Example 2, non-zero elements have been mirrored across the vertical axis to fill the empty spaces on the right.

From these observations, we infer the following transformation rule:
- Non-zero elements on the left half of the bottom rows are mirrored across the vertical middle of the grid to fill the corresponding positions on the right side.

Let’s apply this rule to the given test case:

1. Identify the non-zero elements in the left half of the bottom rows.
2. Mirror them across the center of the grid.

Test Case Input:

Applying the rule:
- Row 4: `[6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2]` will be mirrored to complete the row.
- Row 5: `[6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 6]` will be mirrored to complete the row.

cce03e0d,"To solve the test case, let's analyze the pattern in which the outputs differ from their respective inputs:

In each training example, the output grid is larger than the input grid and appears to contain all rotations of the original 3x3 input grid, arranged in a 9x9 grid.

Here's a breakdown of the pattern:
- The output grid is a 9x9 grid regardless of the input size.
- In the output, each of the original input rows is repeated three times, but with different starting positions. That is, the first copy starts at the beginning, the second starts one position later, and the third starts two positions later.
- After filling the first three rows with those variations, the next three rows are filled similarly but with a vertical shift downwards.

Based on this reasoning, we can apply this transformation to the test case input:

Test Input:
``` 
[
[1, 2, 2],
[2, 0, 1],
[1, 2, 0]]
```

Test Output: Apply the same rotation and repetition pattern:
1. Copy the first row three times with shifts:
```
[1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
2. Copy the second row three times with shifts:
```
[2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
3. Copy the third row three times with shifts:
```
[1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

22168020,"The transformation applied to the input grids involves expanding blocks of numbers (colors) to fill all the space horizontally up until the next color boundary or the edge of the grid. In other words, every non-zero number that appears in a row should fill the spaces between it and the next non-zero number or the edge with its own value.

Let's apply this rule to our test case:

- For rows with only one non-zero number (like the first row in this case), no change is made.
- For rows with multiple non-zero numbers, fill the gaps between them with their own value.

Applying this rule to the test case, we get:

feca6190,"To find the transformation rule, we need to observe the changes made to the input grids to produce the output grids. Here's what we can deduce from the examples provided:

1. For each non-zero element in the input grid, the output grid contains a series of rows and columns that shift this non-zero value diagonally towards the top-left corner.
2. Each non-zero element in the input grid gets its own set of rows and columns in the output grid, with the number of rows and columns being equal to the length of the input grid plus the index of the non-zero element.
3. The non-zero elements move one position closer to the top-left corner with each row in the output grid.

Let’s break down the process for Example 1:

- In the input grid `[1, 0, 7, 0, 0]`, the non-zero elements are `1` at index 0 and `7` at index 2.
- For `1` at index 0, it starts in the bottom-right corner and moves up left by one position in each row until it reaches the top-left corner.
- For `7` at index 2, it starts three positions to the left and two positions up compared to `1`.

Applying the same principles to the test case `[0, 6, 7, 8, 9]`:

- There are five non-zero elements. 
- `6` at index 1 will start at `(4, 1)` in the output grid.
- `7` at index 2 will start at `(3, 2)`.
- `8` at index 3 will start at `(2, 3)`.
- `9` at index 4 will start at `(1, 4)`.

Following the shifting pattern:

0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

This pattern continues until all non-zero values reach the top-left corner, forming a diamond shape.

Thus, the correct output for the test case would be:

3befdf3e,"To derive the rule for transforming the grids from input to output, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. The initial pattern in all the inputs consists of a central block surrounded by a grid mostly filled with zeros.
2. In each case, the central block of numbers expands outward by one unit on all sides.
3. For the newly expanded cells around the original central block, the value is taken from the immediate inner cell (which might mean replicating the edge values).
4. Inside the expanded block, the core pattern stays the same, but the border is extended outwards.

Following these observations, we can solve the test case:

- The top central block [8,3,8] vertically and horizontally would expand to include one additional layer of 8s around it.
- Similarly, the bottom central block [8,3,3,8] vertically and horizontally would expand similarly.

Applying this logic to the test case:

```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], # Top row remains unchanged
[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], # Expand to the right by 1
[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], # Expand to the left and right by 1
[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], # Expand to the left and right by 1
[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], # Expand to the left and right by 1
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], # Middle rows between two blocks remain unchanged
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], # Expand to the left and right by 1
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0], # Expand to the left and right by 1
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0], # Expand to the left and right by 1
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], # Expand to the left and right by 1
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], # Bottom row remains unchanged

e21d9049,"To tackle this puzzle, it's important to observe the pattern of transformation in the provided examples.

In both examples, there appears to be a central column or set of columns that have non-zero values. These non-zero values seem to dictate some form of color replication or propagation across the grid. 

Looking at Example 1, the sequence `8, 3, 2` appears vertically in the middle. In the output, this sequence appears repeated horizontally in row 5, and also reflected vertically in the surrounding rows around the original pattern.

Likewise, in Example 2, the sequence `4, 8, 2, 3, 8, 4` appears in the central section. The output shows this sequence repeated horizontally in row 7, and also reflected vertically above and below this row.

From this, we can infer the following transformation rule:

1. Identify the central column or columns with non-zero values.
2. Take the non-zero sequence from those columns.
3. Create a horizontal row pattern repeating the sequence found in step 2.
4. Use this row as a central ""stripe"" in the output grid.
5. Mirror this stripe vertically above and below based on the original pattern's vertical placement.

Applying this rule to the test case:

The relevant sequence found in the input is `4, 2, 3, 1`.

The expected output would thus have this sequence repeated horizontally as a central row, with a vertical mirroring of this sequence above and below this central row. The exact position of this central row depends on the positioning of the original sequence in the input.

For the test case, the sequence `4, 2, 3, 1` appears in the 7th row. Thus, the transformation rule predicts the output.

6e02f1e3,"Firstly, let's examine the patterns in the transformations of the given examples.

In all the examples, there seems to be a pattern where certain numbers transform into another number or zero. More specifically, the number 2 turns into 0, and the number 4 also turns into 0. The number 3 always transforms into 5. In the case of repeated numbers across a row or column, such as in Example 3 and Example 4 where all entries are either 4 or 3 respectively, it appears that only the first row gets transformed into 5s if the number is 3 or 4, while the rest of the rows are zeros.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rules:
1. Number 2 -> 0.
2. Number 4 -> 0.
3. Number 3 -> 5.
4. When a row or column is entirely filled with the same number, the first row is transformed to 5s if the number is 3, or left as 0s if the number is 4. Other rows become entirely zeros.

Using these rules, let's solve the test case:

Test Case Input:
```
[
[4, 4, 4],
[2, 3, 2],
[3, 2, 3]
]
```

Following the transformation rules, we get:
- Row 1 consists entirely of 4s, so according to our rule 4, it becomes [0, 0, 0].
- Row 2 contains 2s and a 3. According to our rule 1 and 3, it becomes [0, 5, 0].
- Row 3 contains 3s and 2s. Again, using rules 1 and 3, it becomes [5, 0, 5].

Therefore, the transformed output would be:

aba27056,"To find the transformation rule applied to the input grids to generate the corresponding output grids, we need to compare the differences between them.

In all examples provided:

1. There are initial patterns of numbers with some zeros that remain unchanged.
2. Zeros not surrounded by non-zero numbers are changed into fours, particularly those in areas that appear to be 'external' or at the boundary of the solid color regions.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to be filling up the external zero spaces (those not enclosed by any other number) within a larger colored region with a new color represented by the number 4.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- We observe zeroes forming an ""outer"" boundary around the 2s as well as isolated zeroes outside the 2s which should be changed to fours because they are not surrounded by other numbers.
- The zeroes inside the 2s pattern remain untouched since they are enclosed by the 2s.

1. In Example 1, the input has a central column and row filled with '3', and the surrounding area mostly filled with '8' with one '4' in the lower left corner. The output retains the lower left corner and the part of the column and row that intersect at the '4', resulting in a 2x2 matrix.

2. In Example 2, the input has a central column and row filled with '2', and the surrounding area mostly filled with '4' with an isolated '1'. The output retains the '1' and the part of the column and row that intersects at the '1', resulting in a 3x3 matrix.

3. In Example 3, the input has a central column and row filled with '1', and the surrounding area mostly filled with '3' with an isolated '8'. The output retains the '8' and the part of the column and row that intersects at the '8', resulting in a 5x5 matrix.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule appears to be the following:

- Identify the center of the grid.
- Keep only the central part of the grid that includes the unique element and the intersecting parts of the central row and column where that unique element is located.
- Discard all other elements outside of this central subset.

Applying this rule to the test case:

The test grid has a central column and row filled with '0' and the surrounding area mostly filled with '1'. There is one unique '2' in the central region. We need to retain the '2' and the part of the central column and row which intersects at the '2'.

The central column and row have the '2' at position (3, 7), so we keep the elements in positions (2, 6) through (4, 8) both vertically and horizontally.

In Example 1, the pattern within the input grid seems to be centered around a smaller square area that forms the basis of the output. Notice that the numbers in the center form a pattern which is then extracted into a smaller 3x3 output array, excluding the surrounding zeros. 

Similarly, in Example 2, the central elements are isolated, ignoring all the zeros, and the non-zero numbers form another 3x3 output array.

From the above observations, we can infer the rule:
- Identify the innermost non-zero elements forming a square.
- Extract these elements to create a new grid.

The test case grid contains a central square with elements arranged as follows:

2) The central part of the output grid mirrors the original input grid.
3) The mirrored input grid expands in a symmetrical manner to fill the output grid.

This mirroring seems to occur along its vertical and horizontal center lines. For instance, in Example 1, the original [3, 3, 3] row becomes [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], mirroring across the middle; likewise for columns.

1fad071e,"To derive the transformation rule that turns the input grids into the output grids, we need to examine the patterns in the provided examples.

In all examples, the outputs are much smaller than the inputs and consist of a single row of numbers. Observing the examples closely:

1. The output seems to be derived from analyzing the distribution of color numbers in the rows and columns of the input grids.
2. In Example 1, the output `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]` appears when we simplify and condense information about the presence of '1's and '2's in the largest clusters in the input grid.
3. In Example 2, the output `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]` is similar, indicating a possible pattern where the output represents the most frequent non-zero elements across the grid, simplified.
4. In Example 3, the output is again `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]`, suggesting the transformation might involve identifying the most prominent colors (non-zero) in the input grid and reducing them into a condensed form.

Looking at the Test Case:
```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1],
[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],

[2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0],
[2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Analyzing:
- The numbers '1' and '2' appear repeatedly, forming clusters.
- The largest clusters of '1's and '2's seem to span the entire width or height of the grid.
- Similar to previous examples, the output should reflect that '1' and '2' dominate the grid but in a simplified form.

Given the patterns observed, the output should represent the prominent colors (non-zero) in the grid, condensed. Since both '1' and '2' are dominant, we can infer the output grid would reflect this distribution similarly to the provided examples.

Therefore, applying the transformation rule to the test case, the expected output is likely to be dominated by the presence of the numbers '1' and '2', with zeros representing less prominent or rare colors.

a8c38be5,"To solve the test case, let's analyze the transformations from the input to output in the training examples.

In both examples, the output grids seem more condensed and smaller than the input grids. Observing the transformation, it looks like the output grid is formed by selecting and combining certain rows and columns of the input grid. Let's deduce the exact rule applied:

1. **Color Identification**: In each input grid, there are sections or clusters of numbers (colors) that form shapes. The output seems to focus on these clusters, specifically isolating them into smaller matrices.

2. **Grid Shrinking**: The output grids are much smaller than the input grids. It seems that instead of focusing on all rows and columns, only the essential ones needed to capture the shape of the number clusters are preserved.

3. **Shape Preservation**: The output maintains the shape and relative positions of the clusters seen in the input while removing any unnecessary surrounding zeros (empty spaces).

Based on these observations, the transformation appears to preserve the main cluster shapes by reducing the grid to only those rows and columns containing the clusters without empty borders.

Using this understanding, we will extract the main clusters for the test case and create the output grid accordingly:

For the test case, the main cluster appears around the numbers 5, 6, 8, 4, and 1. We'll isolate these clusters, remove surrounding zeros, and condense the grid.

Let's identify the rows and columns to include:
- Rows: 2 through 10 (where the significant clusters are)
- Columns: 2 through 13 (where the significant clusters are)

By extracting these rows and columns, we create the following output grid:

2281f1f4,"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully observe the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples.

- **Observation of Pattern**: In all the given examples, the number `5` often appears in both inputs and outputs, but there's a specific pattern transformation involving the number `2`. When the number `5` appears in a column, it seems to trigger a transformation: all the zeroes directly above or below that `5` become `2`s, except if they are part of an uninterrupted sequence of numbers (which implies those zeroes aren't changed).

- **Transformation Rule**: 
    - If there's a `5` in any row and that row has zeroes above or below it, these zeroes transform into `2`s until another non-zero number is encountered.
    - This transformation does not cross rows with any other non-zero numbers (i.e., only contiguous blocks of zeroes are affected).

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

```text
Input:
[
[5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
]

Applying the transformation:
- Row 1 has `5`s at columns 0, 2, 3, 6, and 8. The zeroes directly below them will turn into `2`s up to the next non-zero in column 9.
- Row 3 has a `5` at column 9, so the zeroes directly above and below it will turn into `2`s.
- Row 4 has a `5` at column 9, so the zeroes directly above and below it will turn into `2`s.
- Row 6 has a `5` at column 9, so the zeroes directly above and below it will turn into `2`s.
- Row 8 has a `5` at column 9, so the zeroes directly above and below it will turn into `2`s.
- Row 10 has a `5` at column 9, so the zeroes directly above and below it will turn into `2`s.
```

The resulting output will be:
```python
[

f25ffba3,"To deduce the transformation rule from the provided input and output pairs, let's analyze the examples step by step:

1. Example 1:
   - In the input, the first appearance of non-zero elements in the row is at the bottom of the grid.
   - In the output, these rows with non-zero elements have been cyclically shifted upwards so that the original top-most non-zero row becomes the new bottom row.

2. Example 2:
   - Again, in the input, the non-zero elements start appearing towards the bottom of the input grid.
   - The transformation shifts the rows with non-zero elements up, with the top-most non-zero row moving to become the bottom-most row in the output.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule is to move all rows containing non-zero elements such that the row which originally had non-zero elements first among the rows is moved to the bottom and all other rows are shifted up accordingly. Here, 'non-zero elements' refer to any number other than zero.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:

[7, 1, 4, 4]

```

Identifying rows with non-zero elements:
- Rows 6 through 10 are non-zero.

Shift them up cyclically:
- Row 6 moves to position 10.
- Row 7 moves to position 6.
- Row 8 moves to position 7.
- Row 9 moves to position 8.
- Row 10 moves to position 9.

dc1df850,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to generate the outputs, we can observe that the output seems to fill in the areas surrounding certain key values with a ""1"". These areas seem to be defined by the presence of non-zero values (besides 1) which stay unchanged.

The regions filled with '1's appear to extend outward from these non-zero values up until they hit another non-zero value or the edge of the grid.

Let's walk through the test case step-by-step:

1. Identify the non-zero values in the input grid.
2. Fill in the surrounding areas with '1' up till the next non-zero value or the boundary.

We'll start from each non-zero value and propagate '1's outwards:
- Value '7' starts at [0][8], so '1's will fill the preceding columns.
- Value '2' at [1][2] will spread '1's in all directions but stop at value '7'.
- Value '2' at [3][7] will spread '1's similarly.
- Value '7' at [5][1] will spread '1's.

b7249182,"To determine how the transformation works, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, we see that non-zero numbers (2 and 8) spread out to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
   - For the number 2, it spreads up and down until it reaches the edge of the grid or another non-zero number.
   - For the number 8, it also spreads up and down, but its expansion begins from a different position than the 2.

2. In Example 2, the number 3 starts spreading upwards and leftwards, and the number 1 starts spreading upwards and rightwards.
   
3. Example 3 demonstrates a similar behavior where the number 5 spreads leftwards and the number 8 spreads rightwards, intersecting in the middle.

From these observations, it appears that when a non-zero color exists, the color spreads in both directions horizontally and vertically until it hits the boundary of the grid or another color. 

Let's apply this understanding to the test case:
- We have two non-zero colors: 7 and 6.
- The 7 is located at row 2, column 4.
- The 6 is located at row 17, column 4.

The solution should spread the 7 upwards and downwards, and the 6 upwards and downwards too, but they will not overlap since they're in different rows and columns, and there's no other non-zero value interrupting their spread:

f9012d9b,"To figure out the transformation rule applied in the examples, let's analyze how the input grids lead to the corresponding output grids.

**Observations from Examples**

1. In Example 1, the input grid is reduced to a 2x2 grid where the first row has alternating 1s and 2s, and the second row has a repeating pattern of 2 and 1.
   
2. In Example 2, the 4x4 grid with alternating 6s and 8s across rows and columns is reduced to a single cell containing 8. This suggests that the most frequent color in the center or a core part of the grid might be selected.

3. In Example 3, the larger 7x7 grid, also consisting of patterns involving 2s and 5s, is reduced to a 2x2 grid where the top row consists entirely of 5s and the bottom row starts with 5 and ends with 2. This may indicate an extraction of the centermost or core elements of the grid.

Given these observations, a common pattern seems to be focusing on the central parts of the grid, especially those forming the core or densest area of the original pattern.

**Analyzing the Test Case**

The test case is a 7x7 grid with a complex pattern of 1s and 8s, with some zeros at the right side:

```[
[8, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0],
[8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8],
[1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1],
[8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8],
[8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8]]
```

The core part of this grid without the zeros appears to be a 5x5 sub-grid of alternating 1s and 8s. If we focus on the central 2x2 portion of this core, it would look like:

```[
[8, 1],
[1, 8]]
```

So, following the pattern observed in the previous examples, where the dense core section is extracted into a smaller grid, the likely transformation result for the test case should reflect this central part.

321b1fc6,"To determine the transformation rule, let's examine the changes made in the training examples.

### Example 1 Analysis

In the first example, we observe that the groups of non-zero numbers are relocated in the output, while maintaining their relative positions with respect to the zero cells:

- In the input, there are two groups of non-zero numbers: 
    - `7`, `6` and `9`, `4` at row 1 and 2, and 
    - `8`, `8` twice repeated in rows 5 and 6.
- In the output, these groups have moved down, with the `7`, `6` and `9`, `4` group moving to the center of the grid, and the second group of `8`, `8` remaining at the bottom.

### Example 2 Analysis

Similarly, for the second example:

- The non-zero numbers form clusters: 
    - Four `8`s in the top-left corner,
    - Two `7`s and two `6`s in the middle,
    - Three `8`s in the lower left,
    - And an additional `8` at the bottom.
- In the output, these clusters are moved downward and some are shifted horizontally to maintain their shape but not necessarily their original placement.

### Generalization of the Rule

The general rule appears to be:

1. **Identify Clusters**: Identify groups or clusters of non-zero numbers.
2. **Move Downward**: Move these clusters downward as far as possible while keeping their internal structure intact.
3. **Keep Zeros as Padding**: Maintain the zero cells around these clusters as padding while shifting them down.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case

For the provided test case, we need to follow the same procedure:

1. Identify the clusters:
    - A large cluster of `8`s at the top-middle.
    - `4`, `4` and `3`, `4`, `3`, `3` in the middle.
    - A cluster of `8`s at the bottom.
2. Move these clusters downward within the grid while preserving their shape.

### Transformation Step-by-Step

1. The top cluster of `8`s:
   - Moves down as far as possible without overlapping other clusters.
2. The middle cluster of `4`s and `3`s:
   - Moves down, placing it just above or below existing clusters.
3. The bottom cluster of `8`s:
   - Moves down if necessary.

The final arrangement would look like this:

0520fde7,"To determine the transformation rule applied in the examples provided, let's analyze the patterns:

1. **Input Grid Dimensions:** Each input grid has dimensions of 3x7.
2. **Output Grid Dimensions:** Each output grid has dimensions of 3x3.
   
From these dimensions, we observe that the output grid is smaller than the input grid. We need to find out if there's any specific pattern or reduction process from the larger grid to the smaller grid.

### Observations on Transformation Rule

Examining how the number 5 appears in the input grid and how 2 appears in the output grid gives us a clue. Specifically, the number 2 in the output seems to correspond to the presence of 5s in the input at particular positions.

#### Step by Step Analysis:
1. In the first example, the 5s are aligned down the 4th column. The output has a 2 in the center position [1][1], indicating possibly a middle column or row selection rule.
2. In the second example, 5s appear in the 4th column again but with additional 1s around them. The output shows 2s in certain positions, suggesting that the value 5 might be causing the 2s when combined with some other logic.
3. In the third example, 5s again are present in the 4th column, producing 2s, but only in certain spots, indicating a selective mapping based on their surroundings.

Given the regularity of where the 5s are placed in the middle and the resulting 2s in the output, it could imply that the transformation involves checking the central column for 5s and assigning 2s in the corresponding positions in the output grid, while keeping the rest as 0s.

### Applying the Transformation Rule to the Test Case:
For the test case, we have the following input:
```python
[
[1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1],
[0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
[1, 0, 1, 5, 0, 1, 0]]
```
This input has 5s in the 4th position of each row. Based on our analysis, these 5s should map to 2s in the corresponding positions in the output grid, resulting in:
```python
[
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 2, 0],
[0, 2, 0]]
```

Thus, the final answer for the test case is:
```python

```",,False,False,0.0
47c1f68c,"To solve the test case, let's first deduce the transformation rule based on the provided training examples.

Observations:
- In all the input grids, there is a central band of the same color (2, 8, 4, and 3 respectively) that spans horizontally through the middle of the grid.
- The output grids are reduced in width compared to the input grids. 
- The numbers surrounding the central band are mirrored across the center of the grid along the vertical axis.
- The central band itself (color 2, 8, 4, and 3) appears to disappear in the output.
- The grid size is reduced by the width of the central band which is always one column wide in the outputs.

Given these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- Remove the central band of same-colored elements.
- Mirror the remaining elements across the vertical center axis to form a more compact grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

```

Step-by-step solution:
1. Remove the central band (column with all 3s):
```[
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

3. Remove the extra column added due to mirroring and condense:
```[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Finally, applying the rule to condense the grid:
```[
[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

d89b689b,"To find the pattern, let's analyze the transformations in the provided examples:

1. All zeros remain as they are.
2. Non-zero values are being moved and placed at new positions, which seem to form a condensed grid near the center.
3. The values that are moved to the new grid don't necessarily retain their original positions but rather are reorganized.

Upon close observation, all non-zero values are being mapped to a central 2x2 grid area in the output, with the top-left being the first non-zero value encountered row-wise from left to right, top to bottom. This forms:

- Top-left cell: first non-zero value
- Top-right cell: second non-zero value
- Bottom-left cell: third non-zero value
- Bottom-right cell: fourth non-zero value

Following this pattern for the Test case:

- First non-zero: 4
- Second non-zero: 3
- Third non-zero: 7
- Fourth non-zero: 6

Therefore, these values should be placed in the 2x2 central grid as follows:

d5d6de2d,"To derive the transformation rule from the input to output grids, we need to observe what changes occur consistently across the provided examples.

1. **Identify the Pattern**:
   - In all of the given examples, the color `2` in the input grid appears to be replaced with `0` in the output grid.
   - Additionally, the central region of the `2`s is filled with `3`s in the output grid. The exact area being filled with `3`s seems to be the region that was surrounded by `2`s but was not on the edge or immediately adjacent to `0`s in the input grid.

2. **Generalize the Rule**:
   - Replace all `2`s with `0`s.
   - For the center portions that were originally `2`s but are now surrounded by `0`s, fill these areas with `3`s.

Applying this rule to the test case:

1. Replace all `2`s with `0`s.
2. Identify the central regions that were surrounded by `2`s in the original input, now filled with `0`s, and replace them with `3`s.

137eaa0f,"To solve this puzzle, I will analyze the provided training examples to discover a pattern for transforming the inputs into outputs.

1. The outputs are consistently 3x3 matrices regardless of the size of the input grids.
2. Each output grid seems to represent a summary or a subset of the colored areas in the input grid.
3. The numbers within the output grids seem to correspond directly to the numbers found in specific segments of the larger input grids.

Upon analyzing the examples carefully:

- In Example 1, the non-zero elements of the input are clustered around the center and top-right sections; these clusters translate into a smaller 3x3 output grid.
- Similarly, Example 2 and Example 3 show that the output grid seems to be a summarized version of the color clusters from the input grid.

The transformation pattern appears to involve selecting specific segments from the input grid, summarizing them and placing those summaries in a 3x3 grid. Specifically, it looks like the output grids capture the non-zero elements from the middle and the bottom parts of the input grids, summarizing them into a smaller 3x3 grid.

Applying this understanding to the test case:
- From the leftmost column (column 0), there are no non-zeros contributing to the output.
- Column 1 contains a '4' which contributes to the first row output.
- Column 2 has a '9', '9', '5', and '2' which contribute to the second and third rows of the output.
- Column 3 contains a '2', which contributes to the third row of the output.

Given this, the output for the test case should be a 3x3 matrix with '4' in the first row, '9' and '5' in the second row, and '2' and '2' in the third row.

Therefore, the output for the test case would be:

d23f8c26,"Upon analyzing the input and output pairs provided, we can identify a pattern in how the transformation is applied:

1. For each column, only the highest non-zero value is kept.
2. All other values in that column, whether they are zeros or non-zeros lower than the highest non-zero value, are replaced with zero.

Let's break down the process using one of the examples provided:

Example 2:
Input:
```
[
[8, 0, 3, 0, 0],
[8, 6, 5, 6, 0],
[3, 6, 3, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 5, 9],

[1, 0, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0]]

We keep only the highest non-zero values in each column and set all others to 0:

Column 1: Highest non-zero is 8
Column 2: Highest non-zero is 8
Column 3: Highest non-zero is 8
Column 4: Highest non-zero is 8
Column 5: Highest non-zero is 8
Column 6: Highest non-zero is 7

1. The number 5 remains unchanged across all rows and columns.

- The 1s and 2s appear to 'spread' or 'grow' towards the closest non-zero neighbors. 
- This spreading happens in such a way as if they fill up the immediate horizontal and vertical gaps, but only towards existing non-zero numbers.

Applying the transformations:

1. The 2 at position (1,1) spreads to the right towards the 1 at (1,3), changing the 0 at (1,2) into a 2.
2. The 1 at position (1,3) fills the gap between itself and the 2 at (1,8).
3. The 1 at (2,6) spreads one space to the left because there's a 2 at (1,8).
4. The 2 at (8,3) spreads to the right towards the 1 at (8,6).
5. The 2 at (9,0) spreads upwards to the nearest available positions.
6. The 1 at (9,8) stays in place as it has no immediate neighbors to spread towards.

88a62173,"To find the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid, we can compare the examples.

Firstly, notice the size difference between the inputs and outputs. Each output is a 2x2 matrix, regardless of the size of the input grid. Thus, we may infer that the rule involves selecting a specific 2x2 submatrix from the input.

Examining the first row and column of the provided inputs and outputs more closely, we see:

- In Example 1, the output comes from rows 1, 4 and columns 1, 5.
- In Example 2, again the output is from rows 1, 4 and columns 1, 5.
- In Example 3, the output is similarly from rows 1, 4 and columns 1, 5.

Therefore, the pattern suggests that the transformation rule involves extracting the top-left and bottom-right elements from the first and fourth rows of the input grid.

Applying this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
[
[5, 5, 0, 5, 0],
[0, 5, 0, 0, 5],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 5, 0, 0, 5]]

The elements at positions (1, 1), (1, 5), (4, 1), and (4, 5) in the test input grid would form the output.

- First row, first column: 5
- First row, fifth column: 0
- Fourth row, first column: 5
- Fourth row, fifth column: 5

Thus, the output should be:

8403a5d5,"To solve the puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids based on the provided examples.

Let's break down the transformation rule:

1. **Initial Pattern Recognition**:
   - The input grid contains a single non-zero value.
   - This non-zero value propagates horizontally across the row in which it appears.
   - In addition to this horizontal propagation, every other column adjacent to the columns containing the non-zero value also gets a specific color (5) periodically.

2. **Identifying the Horizontal Propagation**:
   - For all examples, the non-zero value appears only once in the last row. It's propagated across the entire row with a spacing pattern such that the non-zero value alternates.
   
3. **Pattern of Additional Color (5)**:
   - The additional color (5) appears two positions away from the initial non-zero value in the same row. After that, it repeats every four columns.
   
Let's apply these observations to the test case.

The test case input is:
```python
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Based on the rules:
- The value `1` will propagate horizontally across the 10th row.
- Every second column after the first appearance of `1` will have the value `1`, alternating with zeros.
- The value `5` will appear in the third column (two columns away from `1`) and will repeat every four columns after.

Thus, the output should be:
```python

82819916,"To transform the test case correctly, I'll follow the pattern observed in the training examples:

1. Each non-zero row that has a combination of two different numbers followed by zeros gets modified.
2. In such rows, the first sequence of non-zero numbers repeats throughout the row, replacing all the zeros.

For example, in Example 1's input, the 5th row `[8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` got transformed into `[8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8]`.

Applying these rules to the test case:

- Row 2 (`[2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]`) already contains a repeating pattern, so no change is needed.
- Row 4 (`[8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`) transforms to `[8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 8]`.
- Row 7 (`[1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`) transforms to `[1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1]`.
- Row 10 (`[6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`) transforms to `[6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 6]`.
- Row 13 (`[1, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`) transforms to `[1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1]`.

1. In Example 1:
   - All non-zero elements (5) are replaced with 1 except for the bottom-right corner where a subset of them are replaced with 2.
   
2. In Example 2:
   - As in Example 1, non-zero elements (5) are replaced with 1. 
   - However, the cells in the right column adjacent to the column with 5s are replaced with 2.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Replace all instances of 5 with 1.
- If there is a 5 in the second-to-last column, replace all non-zero cells in the last column with 2.

Applying this rule to the Test case:

- Replace all 5s with 1s.

Let's break it down with the test case step by step:

- First, we look at every '2' value within the grid.
- If a '2' has '2' values around it on all four sides, we replace it with a '1'.
- Any '2' not completely surrounded by other '2's remains a '2'.

Applying these rules to the given test case:

The transformation process changes only the inner '2' values to '1' where they are completely surrounded by '2's on all four sides. This results in the middle row of the bottom row changing to '1's, while the rest of the grid stays the same according to the rule.

In both training examples, I notice that certain patterns or sequences of numbers seem to spread or propagate into adjacent cells. Let's analyze the transformation:

- In **Example 1**, the '8' values propagate horizontally to fill empty cells, and similarly, the '2' value spreads to create a pattern.
- In **Example 2**, the '8' values also propagate horizontally to fill in the gaps, and the '2' values form a similar spreading pattern.

Based on these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves the propagation of values horizontally to fill in adjacent zeros.

1. **Identify the first non-zero row**: For all the examples, the transformation starts from the first non-zero row.
    - Example 1: The first non-zero row is `[2, 1, 4]`.
    - Example 2: The first non-zero row is `[3, 2, 1, 4]`.
    - Example 3: The first non-zero row is `[8, 3]`.

2. **Pattern of transformation**:
   - Each subsequent row that follows the initial non-zero rows is filled with a repeated pattern taken from the top row until the entire grid is filled up.

3. **Repetition of top-row elements**: 
    - In Example 1, the row `[2, 1, 4]` repeats down the grid.
    - In Example 2, the row `[3, 2, 1, 4]` repeats down the grid.
    - In Example 3, the row `[8, 3]` repeats down the grid.

Given these observations, the transformation rule is: repeat the sequence of integers from the first non-zero row throughout the remaining rows of the grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- First non-zero row: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 8]`
- The second row is `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`, which does not follow the repeating pattern; it remains unchanged.
- The rest of the grid will have rows repeating `[1, 2, 3, 4, 8]`.

This gives us the following output:

253bf280,"To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the transition from the input to the output in the provided examples.

The rule appears to be that any pair of '8's that are horizontally or vertically aligned with empty spaces (0) between them get filled with '3's up to the '8's:

- In Example 1, the '8' at the 4th row and 3rd column and the '8' at the same row but at the 10th column get '3's between them.
- Similarly, in Example 2, the '8's at (2,5), (8,5), and (7,9) have '3's filling the gaps.
- Example 3 shows '8's at different rows (at (2,2), (2,10), (9,3) and (9,8)), filling the spaces with '3's accordingly.
- Other examples follow the same pattern where '3's fill the space between pairs of '8's.

We can apply this rule to the test case:

2. '8's at (6th row, 7th column) and (6th row, 13th column).

be94b721,"To solve the puzzle, let's analyze the transformation rule based on the given examples:

1. In all examples, the output is a square grid that appears to be a simplified version of the pattern present in the input.
2. The output focuses on the largest continuous block of non-zero numbers that is present in the input.

Let's break down the examples:

- Example 1: The largest continuous block of non-zero numbers is the block of color '2', which forms a 4x3 shape. However, the 'output' shows a smaller 4x3 block extracted from it, where the color '2' is the dominant color.
- Example 2: Largest continuous block of non-zero numbers is the block of '4', forming a 3x2 block. 
- Example 3: Largest block is the combination of '8' and '7'. However, the output is focused on the '8' block.
- Example 4: Largest block is a mix of '2' and '7'. The output focuses on the '2' block.

From these examples, the transformation seems to focus on isolating the largest contiguous block of one specific number. The blocks are sometimes trimmed to fit into a square grid.

For the Test Case:
```

4093f84a,"To understand the transformation rule applied to the input grids to produce the output grids, let's analyze each training example carefully.

### Observations on Transformation:
- The transformation seems to affect only specific non-zero patterns in the input grid.
- In all examples provided, certain colored blocks or isolated non-zero elements seem to spread or change to other colors, specifically the color `5` seems to be affecting others.
- Patterns suggest that if there's a block of `5`s, adjacent non-zero elements of different colors might be replaced or absorbed by the `5`s, while the `5` block itself remains unchanged or slightly modified around its borders.

### Pattern Identification:
In each input-output pair, the `5` block appears to spread out and absorb surrounding elements that are not `5`, effectively homogenizing regions around `5`. Elements that aren't `0` or `5` (like `2`, `3`, `4`) seem to be changed to `5` where they are adjacent or in proximity to a `5` block.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
Based on the observations, I'll apply the same logic to our test case:

```python

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

```

#### Applying the transformation:
- All `4`s surrounding the block of `5`s should become `5`.
- The block of `5`s remains the same but the surrounding `4`s should be turned into `5`.

2204b7a8,"To determine the rule used in transforming the input grids to their corresponding output grids, I'll start by examining the changes in the provided examples.

From Example 1:
- The color `3` is replaced with `1` in some places.
- The value `3` located at `(6, 2)` becomes `1`.
- The second occurrence of `3` located at `(1, 6)` becomes `2`.

From Example 2:
- The color `3` is replaced by `4` in some positions and by `7` in others.
- The first `3` located at `(2, 1)` becomes `4`.
- The second `3` located at `(2, 7)` becomes `4`.
- The third `3` located at `(3, 3)` becomes `4`.
- The fourth `3` located at `(6, 4)` becomes `7`.
- The fifth `3` located at `(7, 8)` becomes `7`.

From Example 3:
- The color `3` is replaced by `8` in some positions, and `9` in others.
- The first `3` located at `(2, 4)` becomes `8`.
- The second `3` located at `(3, 1)` becomes `8`.
- The third `3` located at `(3, 7)` becomes `8`.
- The fourth `3` located at `(6, 1)` becomes `9`.
- The fifth `3` located at `(6, 6)` becomes `9`.
- The sixth `3` located at `(7, 3)` becomes `9`.

Based on the transformation patterns, it appears that `3` values are replaced with the color found directly above them, unless there's another `3` present in the same column, in which case, it gets replaced with the top-most `3`'s row's edge color.

Applying this rule to the test case:

1. The first `3` located at `(1, 3)` will change to `5`.
2. The second `3` located at `(1, 5)` will change to `5`.
3. The third `3` located at `(3, 3)` will change to `5`.
4. The fourth `3` located at `(5, 3)` will change to `5`.
5. The fifth `3` located at `(5, 6)` will change to `5`.
6. The sixth `3` located at `(8, 4)` will change to `5`.
7. The seventh `3` located at `(9, 2)` will change to `5`.
8. The eighth `3` located at `(9, 6)` will change to `5`.

Looking at both Example 1 and Example 2, we can see that some cells with value `0` adjacent to `8` have been changed to `1`. Specifically:

- If there is an 8 cell, and any immediate neighbor (up, down, left, right) is a 0, this 0 becomes a 1 in the output.
- Diagonal neighbors do not change according to this rule.

Let's apply this to the Test input grid:

3de23699,"To understand the transformation rule applied to the input grids to obtain the corresponding output grids, let's analyze the patterns in the sample transformations:

1. In Example 1, the largest contiguous group of 4s is selected and shrunk to a 3x3 grid by removing the outermost layer of zeros. Similarly, the group of 2s in the center of the input grid was transformed into a smaller representation by removing surrounding zeros.

2. Example 2 follows a similar pattern where larger contiguous groups of 3s and 2s in the input were isolated and reduced to their core shapes by trimming the surrounding zeros. This time, the output grid is not square but retains the shape of the largest colored regions.

3. Example 3 shows a combination of 6s and 8s. The transformation rule here also seems to isolate blocks of the same color and shrink them while maintaining the relative positions of these blocks to each other.

4. Example 4 again demonstrates that the transformation aims to isolate the distinct groups of numbers and trim away the extra zeros around those groups.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be about isolating the distinct non-zero regions within the grid, and creating a smaller grid (without excess zeros) that retains the relative positions and colors of those non-zero regions.

Applying this rule to the Test grid:

- We have two distinct non-zero regions: one with 2s and another with 3s.
- The region with 2s forms a vertical line in the third column.
- The region with 3s forms a more complex shape across several rows and columns.

We will remove all surrounding zeros to isolate these regions and form a new grid that only contains the core shape of these regions.

Thus, the resulting grid should represent these core shapes without unnecessary padding of zeros.

- Example 1 shows that 3 becomes 4, 1 becomes 5, and 2 becomes 6.
- Example 2 shows that 2 becomes 6, 3 becomes 4, and 8 becomes 9.
- Example 3 indicates 5 becomes 1, 8 becomes 9, and 6 becomes 2.
- Example 4 confirms 9 becomes 8, 4 becomes 3, and 2 becomes 6.

We notice that there is no simple arithmetic relationship like addition or subtraction that applies consistently. Instead, it seems like a specific mapping exists between each number and its transformed counterpart.

Let's try to infer the transformation rule based on these mappings:
- If we look at the transformations, each number has a unique corresponding number. For instance, 3 always maps to 4, 1 always maps to 5, etc.

For the test case, the input is:
```[
[8, 1, 3],
[8, 1, 3],
[8, 1, 3]
]```

Based on the observed transformations:
- 8 maps to 9,
- 1 maps to 5,
- 3 maps to 4.

Applying these transformations to the test case, we get:
```[
[9, 5, 4],
[9, 5, 4],
[9, 5, 4]
]```

Therefore, the answer to the test case is:
Answer: ```[
[9, 5, 4],

a9f96cdd,"To solve the puzzle, let's break down the patterns we see in the transformation of the input grids into their respective output grids.

First, the common pattern observed across all the examples is that the number `2` in the input grid seems to trigger a transformation that affects the surrounding cells with specific numbers (`3`, `6`, `8`, `7`) placed in certain relative positions.

Observing the positions:
- When `2` appears, the numbers `3`, `6`, `8`, `7` seem to appear in a cross-like pattern with `3` and `6` horizontally adjacent, and `8` and `7` vertically adjacent.
- The exact placement of these numbers relative to `2` appears to change based on the position of `2`.

For example:
- In **Example 1**, the `2` is at row 1, column 1. After transformation, `3` appears directly above and `6` to the right, while `8` and `7` appear below.
- In **Example 2**, the `2` is at the bottom-right corner. After transformation, `3` appears one cell to the left of `2`.
- In **Example 3**, the `2` is centered in the middle row. The `8` and `7` appear in the row below, and `3` and `6` don't appear because they would fall outside the grid.
- In **Example 4**, the `2` is positioned such that `3`, `6`, `8`, and `7` can be placed around it fitting in the grid layout.

Based on this pattern, the `2` in the test case is located at row 1, column 4. Therefore, following the observed transformations, `3` should appear one cell to the left (row 1, column 3), and `6` should appear two cells to the right (out of bounds, so it won’t be visible), similarly, `8` and `7` will be placed in the rows below, specifically `8` at row 2, column 4, and `7` at row 3, column 4.

Following this logic, the output grid for the test case will have:

- `3` at row 1, column 3
- `8` at row 2, column 4
- `7` at row 3, column 4

Therefore, the output grid will be:

7fe24cdd,"To derive the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids in the training examples.

1. All output grids are larger than their respective input grids, with dimensions doubled both horizontally and vertically.
2. The first half of each row in the output grid is a copy of the input grid.
3. The second half of each row in the output grid mirrors the first half but rotated by 180 degrees. This means that the rightmost column of the second half corresponds to the leftmost column of the original input grid.
4. The pattern holds true for both rows and columns.

Using these rules, we can construct the output grid for the test case:

Input:
```
[
[2, 5, 0],
[2, 5, 1],
[3, 1, 1]]
```

To construct the output grid:
- We double the size both horizontally and vertically.
- Copy the original 3x3 grid into the upper-left 3x3 section of the new 6x6 grid.
- Mirror the first half to form the second half, rotating by 180 degrees.

Output:
```
[
[2, 5, 0, 0, 5, 2],
[2, 5, 1, 1, 5, 2],

5bd6f4ac,"To derive the transformation rule from the examples provided, we need to find a pattern that matches the changes observed from the input to the output in all the examples.

Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. In Example 1, the first three columns of the input grid were removed, leaving only the last three columns. Then, the resulting nine-element strip was reshaped to a 3x3 grid.
   
2. Example 2 follows the same pattern: columns 4 to 6 (counting from 1) form the new 3x3 grid after removing the first three columns.

3. Similarly, Example 3 and Example 4 also follow the same process where the last three columns are kept and the first six columns are discarded before forming the new 3x3 grid.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- Discard the first six columns of the 9-column grid.
- Keep the last three columns of the 9-column grid.
- Reshape the remaining 27 elements into a 3x3 grid.

Applying this rule to the Test case:

Input:
```[
[6, 9, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 8, 9],
[2, 9, 0, 6, 0, 8, 0, 9, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 2, 0],
[9, 2, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 6, 8],
[7, 7, 4, 0, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 7, 4],
[4, 1, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 9],
[9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
[4, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0]]
```

Removing the first six columns and keeping the last three columns gives us the following 9-element sequence:
```[5, 8, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 2, 0]```

Reshaping this sequence into a 3x3 grid yields:
```[
[5, 8, 9],
[0, 9, 0],

11852cab,"To understand the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the examples provided:

1. In Example 1, we see that a color value (3) is mirrored across the center column (column 5) when there is an empty spot (0) in the corresponding position on the opposite side. This happens with the value 3 at (row 1, column 2) and its mirror image appears at (row 1, column 8).

2. Example 2 shows a similar pattern where the number 2 is mirrored across the center column. For instance, a '2' at (row 2, column 2) mirrors to (row 2, column 7), and again a '2' at (row 6, column 2) mirrors to (row 6, column 7).

3. Example 3 also supports this observation, where the value '4' mirrors itself across the center column.

In all cases, the color values appear to be mirrored only if their corresponding positions on the opposite side of the central column are empty (0). Values in the center column or values not surrounded by empty spaces do not get mirrored.

Applying this logic to the Test case:

- The '1' at (row 2, column 1) should mirror to (row 2, column 9) since the position at (row 2, column 9) is empty.
- The '4' at (row 3, column 3) should mirror to (row 3, column 7).
- The '1' at (row 3, column 5) does not mirror since there's no empty space at the mirror position (row 3, column 5).
- The '2' at (row 4, column 2) should mirror to (row 4, column 8).
- The '2' at (row 6, column 2) should mirror to (row 6, column 8).
- The '1' at (row 7, column 1) should mirror to (row 7, column 9).

Therefore, the transformed grid would look like this:

``` 
[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],

The transformation seems to propagate the non-zero values horizontally and vertically within the grid until they reach another non-zero value or the edge of the grid. The propagation happens from left to right and top to bottom.

For instance, in Example 1, the 6 at position (5, 5) spreads downwards until it reaches another non-zero element or the grid's boundary. Similarly, values like 2 and 4 follow the same pattern horizontally and vertically.

### Observations:
1. **Example 1**: The single `1` and `2` become blocks of `1`s and `2`s. The block size seems to extend horizontally and vertically until another color boundary or edge of the grid.
2. **Example 2**: Similar behavior. One `3` at the top grows into a rectangle of `3`s, and a single `7` at the bottom-right also expands into a block of `7`s.
3. **Example 3**: A `4` in the middle and another `4` near the bottom both grow into blocks, filling up their respective regions.
4. **Example 4**: Single `7` in the second row expands into a large block of `7`s horizontally and vertically.

### Rule:
From these observations, we can infer that any single instance of a non-zero number (a colored cell) spreads horizontally and vertically as far as possible until it reaches either another non-zero number (a different color) or the edge of the grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- Start with the `8` at position `[0,0]`. It will spread horizontally and vertically until it meets the `6` at `[4,5]`.
- The `8` at `[1,2]` will merge with the spreading block of `8`s.
- The `6` at `[5,1]` will similarly spread horizontally and vertically.
- The `6` at `[4,5]` will connect with the other `6`.

1. **Size Reduction**: The output grids are smaller than the input grids in all cases. Specifically, they all have 2 rows and 2 columns.

2. **Pattern Observation**: We notice that the elements in the output seem to correspond to the unique elements at certain positions in the first row and column of the input grids.
   - Example 1: From `[4, 3, 6, 4, 0, 6]` and `[4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0]`, we obtain `[4, 3]` and `[6, 0]`.
   - Example 2: From `[2, 4, 2, 2, 5, 2, 4, 5]` and `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, we get `[2, 4]` and `[2, 5]`.
   - Example 3: From `[3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1]` and `[3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]`, we derive `[3, 2]` and `[1, 4]`.

Based on these observations, it appears the rule is:
- Take the first element of the first row of the input grid as the top-left element of the output grid.
- Take the second element of the first row of the input grid as the top-right element of the output grid.
- Take the first element of the first column of the input grid as the bottom-left element of the output grid.
- Take the second element of the first column of the input grid as the bottom-right element of the output grid.

Following the rule:
- First element of the first row: `9`
- Second element of the first row: `6`
- First element of the first column: `9`

            new_row.append(row[0])

f8a8fe49,"To identify the transformation rule being applied in these examples, let's observe the changes between inputs and outputs:

1. In Example 1, we notice that the '5' sections have moved up two rows.
2. In Example 2, we see that the '5' sections have moved around the '2' sections, effectively rotating the '5' sections while keeping '2' sections fixed.
3. In Example 3, we again see '5' sections moving around the '2' sections, but the entire pattern seems to rotate.

Based on patterns observed in all examples, the transformation appears to involve rearranging the groups of '5' around groups of '2', maintaining the relative positions within those groups. Specifically, the '5' regions seem to shift while respecting the boundaries set by '2' regions, which tend to stay stationary.

Let's apply this reasoning to the test case provided.

In the test case, there is a larger group of '5' at the center with smaller '5' clusters above and below. This central '5' cluster should move according to the rules identified:
- It will move around the '2' clusters.
- The smaller '5' cluster above should move down and align with the '5' cluster originally directly below it.

Using this logic, the test case would transform as follows:

1. The central '5' cluster shifts down to align with the lower '5' cluster.
2. The upper '5' cluster moves down to fill the space left by the central '5' cluster.

With these transformations in mind, the solution can be constructed as follows:

8e5a5113,"To determine the transformation rule applied to the input grids to get their respective output grids, let's first observe the patterns in the training examples.

For all examples, the transformation appears to fill in the zeros with specific numbers based on the existing non-zero elements. In particular, we can see that the pattern seems to mirror or repeat the non-zero parts of the input grid:

- Each non-zero row in the left part of the input grid is mirrored into the right part of the output grid.
- Additionally, the sequence of numbers in the filled part (after the zeros) seems to reverse or rearrange based on the initial pattern of the non-zero section of the grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Input:
```
[[3, 3, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
 [9, 9, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 9, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Based on the observed rule:
- The zeros will be filled with the non-zero values in a manner to create a mirrored or rearranged version of the input.

Using the same method seen in the examples, we replicate the non-zero section and mirror/rearrange it in the zero-filled area:

Test Output:
```
[[3, 3, 9, 5, 9, 3, 3, 5, 9, 9, 9],

74dd1130,"To find the transformation rule, let's compare each input/output pair to identify any consistent changes.

Examining Example 1:
Input: 
```
[
[2, 2, 1],
[1, 5, 1],
[5, 2, 2]]
```
Output:
```
[
[2, 1, 5],
[2, 5, 2],
[1, 1, 2]]
```

In the first row, the second 2 became 1 and then 1 became 5.
In the second row, the first 1 became 2 and then the middle 5 became 5 remained the same while the second 1 became 2.
In the third row, the first 5 became 1, 2 became 1, and the last 2 stayed.

Examining Example 2:
Input:
```
[
[2, 2, 5],
[6, 2, 2],
[5, 5, 5]]
```
Output:
```
[
[2, 6, 5],
[2, 2, 5],
[5, 2, 5]]
```

In the first row, the second 2 became a 6, and 5 remained 5.
In the second row, the 6 became 2, 2 became 2 and the second 2 became a 5.
In the third row, the first 5 remained the same, 5 became 2, and the last 5 remained the same.

Looking at these transformations, we can see that it may be rotating the numbers in each column. Let’s confirm this with other examples:

Examining Example 3:
Input:
```
[
[9, 9, 5],
[5, 5, 8],
[5, 8, 9]]
```
Output:
```
[
[9, 5, 5],
[9, 5, 8],
[5, 8, 9]]
```

In every column, the numbers seem to have moved downwards, with the bottom number moving to the top.

Examining Example 4:
Input:
```
[
[2, 6, 6],
[2, 1, 1],
[2, 6, 2]]
```
Output:
```
[
[2, 2, 2],
[6, 1, 6],
[6, 1, 2]]
```

Again, the transformation matches the downward shift within columns.

Based on this analysis, the transformation rule appears to be: **shift each number in a column one position down, wrapping around so the bottom number moves to the top**.

Applying this rule to the test case:
```
[
[9, 3, 4],
[9, 4, 4],
[9, 3, 4]]
```

Shift each column:
- First column: [9, 9, 9] becomes [9, 9, 9]
- Second column: [3, 4, 3] becomes [3, 3, 4]
- Third column: [4, 4, 4] becomes [4, 4, 4]

Therefore, the output should be:
```python
[[9, 3, 4], [9, 3, 4], [9, 4, 4]]
```

So the solution is:

### Step-by-step Analysis:

In all the provided examples, we have observed that specific numbers (mainly `8` and `1`) are changed into another number (`5`). Let's break down the patterns further:

#### Example 1:
**Input**
```
[
[2, 2, 2],
[2, 1, 8],
[2, 8, 8]
]
```

**Output**
```
[
[2, 2, 2],
[2, 5, 5],
[2, 5, 5]
]
```

- Here, the `1` and `8` in the original grid are transformed into `5`.

#### Example 2:
**Input**
```
[
[1, 1, 1],
[8, 1, 3],
[8, 2, 2]
]
```

**Output**
```
[
[1, 1, 1],
[5, 1, 5],
[5, 5, 5]
]
```

- In this case, `8` and `3` are transformed into `5`. Note how the `1`s remain unchanged but `8`s around them turn into `5`s.

#### Example 3:
**Input**
```
[
[2, 2, 2],
[8, 8, 2],
[2, 2, 2]
]
```

**Output**
```
[
[2, 2, 2],
[5, 5, 2],
[2, 2, 2]
]
```

- This shows isolated `8`s and those adjacent to other `8`s being replaced with `5`.

#### Example 4:
**Input**
```
[
[3, 3, 8],
[4, 4, 4],
[8, 1, 1]
]
```

**Output**
```
[
[5, 5, 5],
[4, 4, 4],
[5, 5, 5]
]
```

- Here, the `8`s and `1`s are both replaced by `5`, while `4` remains unchanged.

After analyzing these transformations, the pattern seems to be that any `8` and `1` in the grid is changed to `5`.

### Applying the Transformation to the Test Case:

**Test Case Input**
```
[
[1, 3, 2],
[3, 3, 2],
[1, 3, 2]
]
```

According to the identified rule, every `1` should be replaced by `5`. However, there are no `8`s to transform in this grid.

Therefore, the final output grid will be:

```python
[
[5, 3, 2],
[3, 3, 2],
[5, 3, 2]
]

[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]
```

Output:
```
[
[4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8],
[8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4]]
```

In both examples, we notice the following pattern:
- The first row alternates between the color of the first row in the input and the color of the second row in the input.
- The second row also alternates but starts with the color of the second row in the input.

So, the transformation rule seems to alternate the colors from the first and second rows throughout the entire grid.

Applying this rule to the test case:

**Test Case:**
Input:
```
[
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]
```

We will create an alternating pattern based on the colors 6 and 2.

Output:
```
[
[6, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2],
[2, 6, 2, 6, 2, 6]]
```

Therefore, the answer is:
``` 
Answer: [[6, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2], [2, 6, 2, 6, 2, 6]]

ddf7fa4f,"To solve this puzzle, I will analyze the transformations that occur based on the provided input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. In all cases, there exists a central cluster of colored cells (non-zero) that changes color.
2. Cells with color '5' are transformed to a different color in the output that matches the nearest non-zero color surrounding it.
3. The transformation starts from the outermost layer of the central cluster and affects all connected cells within the cluster.
4. The new color assigned is based on the first non-zero color found when scanning left, right, up, and down from each '5' cell.

Let's apply this pattern to the Test case:

1. Identify the central cluster of '5's surrounded by non-zero cells.
2. Replace each '5' with the closest non-zero color found in the surrounding cells.

Test Input:
``` 
[
[3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5],
[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5],
[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

For the central cluster:
- Each '5' in the first row of 5s should become a '6' due to the 6 at the top center.
- Each '5' in the second and third rows of 5s should become a '6'.
- The isolated 5s at the bottom will become '9' as they are adjacent to the 9 on the right.

Applying these transformations:

The output should be:
``` 
[
[3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

4c5c2cf0,"To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. In Example 1, we see that the pattern of '2's and '4's is mirrored along the central vertical axis.
2. In Example 2, similar to Example 1, the pattern of '8's and '3's are mirrored along the central vertical axis.
3. In Example 3, the pattern of '1's and '8's also follows the rule of mirroring along the central vertical axis.

From these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves reflecting the non-zero elements (colors) across the vertical middle line of the grid.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the test case:

b91ae062,"To solve this problem, we need to figure out the pattern that's being applied in the transformation from input to output. From the examples provided, it appears that the transformation involves expanding each non-zero value in the input grid into a block of that value with dimensions equal to the size of the input grid.

For instance, in Example 1, the `6` in the first row and column expands into a `6x6` block of `6`s, and the `7` in the second column and first row expands into a `6x6` block of `7`s, and so on for all non-zero values. This expansion pattern is consistent across all examples.

Let's break down the transformation rule:

1. For each non-zero element in the input grid, create a sub-grid (block) of the same size as the input grid where every element is the value of that non-zero element.
2. Place this sub-grid in the output grid at the corresponding position, with the top-left corner of the sub-grid aligned with the corresponding position in the input grid.

Now let's apply this rule to the test case:

Input Test Case:
``` [
[0, 1, 0],
[0, 8, 7],
[9, 9, 0]
] ```

Following our identified transformation rule:

1. The value `1` at position `[0][1]` will form a `3x3` block of `1`s starting from `[0][1]`.
2. The value `8` at position `[1][1]` will form a `3x3` block of `8`s starting from `[1][1]`.
3. The value `7` at position `[1][2]` will form a `3x3` block of `7`s starting from `[1][2]`.
4. The value `9` at positions `[2][0]` and `[2][1]` will form two different `3x3` blocks of `9`s starting from `[2][0]` and `[2][1]`, respectively.

Applying this rule, the output should be formed as follows:

- A block of `1`s starting from `[0][1]`.
- A block of `8`s starting from `[1][1]`.
- A block of `7`s starting from `[1][2]`.
- Two overlapping blocks of `9`s starting from `[2][0]` and `[2][1]`.

Let's construct the output grid based on these transformations:

Output Test Case:
``` [
[0, 1, 1, 1],
[0, 8, 8, 7],
[0, 8, 8, 7],
[9, 9, 9, 0]
] ```

However, since the dimension of the output needs to be `3x3` times larger than the input, the final output will be a `9x9` grid as per the rules observed from the examples.

Thus, the full output for the test case would be:
