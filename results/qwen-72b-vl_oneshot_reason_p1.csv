To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: 8x8 grid
   - Output: 4x4 grid
   - The output grid seems to be a condensed version of the input grid. Each cell in the output grid appears to be derived from a 2x2 block in the input grid.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: 8x8 grid
   - Output: 4x4 grid
   - Similar to Example 1, the output grid is a condensed version of the input grid, with each cell derived from a 2x2 block in the input grid.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: 8x8 grid
   - Output: 4x4 grid
   - The same pattern is observed: the output grid is a condensed version of the input grid, with each cell derived from a 2x2 block in the input grid.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: 8x8 grid
   - Output: 4x4 grid
   - The pattern continues: the output grid is a condensed version of the input grid, with each cell derived from a 2x2 block in the input grid.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: 8x8 grid
   - Output: 4x4 grid
   - The same pattern is observed: the output grid is a condensed version of the input grid, with each cell derived from a 2x2 block in the input grid.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Each 2x2 block in the input grid is condensed into a single cell in the output grid.
- The value of the cell in the output grid is determined by the non-zero value in the 2x2 block. If there are multiple non-zero values, the first non-zero value encountered in the block is used.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

Applying the transformation rule:
- First 2x2 block: [0, 4], [0, 4] -> 4
- Second 2x2 block: [0, 4], [4, 4] -> 4
- Third 2x2 block: [5, 0], [5, 0] -> 5

- Eighth 2x2 block: [5, 5], [0, 0] -> 5
- Ninth 2x2 block: [6, 0], [0, 0] -> 6
- Tenth 2x2 block: [6, 6], [0, 6] -> 6
- Eleventh 2x2 block: [9, 9], [0, 9] -> 9
- Twelfth 2x2 block: [9, 0], [0, 0] -> 9
- Thirteenth 2x2 block: [0, 6], [6, 0] -> 6

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input has a '1' at position (2,2) and a '5' at position (3,2). In the output, the '1' is removed, and the '5' remains. Additionally, a '1' appears at position (4,2) in the output.
2. In Example 2, the input has '1's at positions (2,1) and (2,3), and '5's at positions (3,1) and (3,3). In the output, the '1's are removed, and the '5's remain. A '1' appears at position (4,1) and (4,3) in the output.
3. In Example 3, the input has '1's at positions (2,1) and (2,4), and '5's at positions (3,1) and (3,4). In the output, the '1's are removed, and the '5's remain. A '1' appears at position (4,1) and (4,4) in the output.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Any '1' in the input is removed in the output.
- A '1' is added in the output at the same column as the '1' in the input but in the last row (row 4 in these examples).
- The '5's remain in the same positions in the output as they are in the input.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has non-zero values at positions (0,1) and (0,5). In the output, these values are repeated in a pattern: every other row has the same non-zero values at the same positions, and the rows in between have zeros at those positions but the non-zero values from the original row at the positions shifted by one column to the left and right.

2. In Example 2, the input grid has a non-zero value at position (0,1). The output follows the same pattern: the non-zero value is repeated in every other row at the same position, and the rows in between have zeros at that position but the non-zero value from the original row at the positions shifted by one column to the left and right.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each non-zero value in the first row of the input grid, the output grid will have:
  - The same non-zero value in the same position in every other row.
  - In the rows in between, zeros at that position but the non-zero value from the original row at the positions shifted by one column to the left and right.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input has a block of '3's surrounded by '8's. In the output, the '3's have expanded to fill the entire row where they were originally present. The '8's remain unchanged.
2. **Example 2**: The input has a block of '1's surrounded by '6's. In the output, the '1's have expanded to fill the entire row where they were originally present. The '6's remain unchanged.
3. **Example 3**: The input has a block of '7's surrounded by '1's. In the output, the '7's have expanded to fill the entire row where they were originally present. The '1's remain unchanged.
4. **Example 4**: The input has a block of '2's surrounded by '3's. In the output, the '2's have expanded to fill the entire row where they were originally present. The '3's remain unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify the block of numbers that are surrounded by another number.
- Expand the block of numbers to fill the entire row where they are present, while keeping the surrounding numbers unchanged.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The block of '5's is surrounded by '4's.
- The '5's should expand to fill the entire row where they are present.
- The '4's should remain unchanged.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a central pattern of numbers surrounded by zeros. The output grid is a smaller grid that retains the central pattern but removes the outer zeros. The dimensions of the output grid are reduced, focusing on the non-zero elements.

2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the output grid is a smaller version of the input grid, focusing on the central non-zero elements. The outer zeros are removed, and the central pattern is preserved.

3. **Example 3**: The output grid again focuses on the central non-zero elements, removing the outer zeros. The dimensions of the output grid are adjusted to fit the central pattern.

4. **Example 4**: The same pattern is observed. The output grid is a smaller version of the input grid, focusing on the central non-zero elements and removing the outer zeros.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Remove the outermost rows and columns that are entirely zeros.
- The resulting grid will only contain the central non-zero elements, preserving their relative positions.

Applying this rule to the test case:

The test case input grid has a central pattern of non-zero elements surrounded by zeros. By removing the outermost rows and columns that are entirely zeros, we get the following output grid:

3. **Example 3**: The pattern continues. Rows and columns are duplicated, and a new row/column with the value 8 is inserted between each pair.

4. **Example 4**: The pattern is consistent. Rows and columns are duplicated, and a new row/column with the value 8 is inserted between each pair.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a few non-zero values scattered around.
   - The output grid shows that some of these non-zero values have been duplicated or shifted slightly.
   - Specifically, the value `3` at position (1,13) remains the same, but the value `6` at (5,19) is duplicated to (5,20) and (6,20).
   - The value `8` at (4,6) is duplicated to (4,7) and (5,7).

2. **Example 2:**
   - The value `8` at (4,10) is duplicated to (4,11) and (5,11).
   - The value `4` at (10,0) is duplicated to (10,1) and (11,1).

3. **Example 3:**
   - The value `2` at (12,5) is duplicated to (12,6) and (13,6).
   - The value `8` at (1,15) is duplicated to (1,16) and (2,16).

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each non-zero value in the input grid, if it is not already part of a sequence of the same value, it is duplicated to the right and down-right positions.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has a '5' at positions (4, 6) and (6, 2), and '2's at positions (10, 1), (10, 4), and (10, 6).
   - The output shows that all '0's in the grid are replaced with '2's, except for the positions where there were '5's in the input. The '5's remain unchanged.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input has a '5' at positions (4, 5), (6, 1), and (7, 8), and '2's at positions (10, 1), (10, 4), and (10, 6).
   - The output again shows that all '0's are replaced with '2's, except for the positions where there were '5's in the input. The '5's remain unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Replace all '0's in the grid with '2's.
- Keep all '5's and '2's in their original positions.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: The transformation seems to involve flipping the grid vertically. The top row of the input becomes the bottom row of the output, and vice versa. This pattern is consistent across the entire grid.

2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the grid appears to be flipped vertically. The top row of the input is now the bottom row of the output, and the bottom row of the input is now the top row of the output.

3. **Example 3**: The same vertical flipping pattern is observed. The top row of the input is now the bottom row of the output, and the bottom row of the input is now the top row of the output.

4. **Example 4**: Again, the grid is flipped vertically. The top row of the input is now the bottom row of the output, and the bottom row of the input is now the top row of the output.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule is to flip the grid vertically. This means that the first row of the input becomes the last row of the output, the second row of the input becomes the second-to-last row of the output, and so on.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a pattern of 2s in the second row and 3s in the first, third, and fourth rows. In the output, the 2s remain unchanged, but the 3s are replaced by 4s, except for the first and last rows where they remain 3s. This suggests that the transformation rule might involve replacing certain values with 4s, but not all of them.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a pattern of 6s in the fifth column and 8s in the fifth row. In the output, the 6s and 8s remain unchanged, but the surrounding 0s are replaced by 4s. This suggests that the transformation rule might involve replacing 0s with 4s if they are adjacent to certain values.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a pattern of 1s in the third column and 9s in the third row. In the output, the 1s and 9s remain unchanged, but the surrounding 0s are replaced by 4s. This further supports the idea that the transformation rule involves replacing 0s with 4s if they are adjacent to certain values.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Replace 0s with 4s if they are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to any non-zero value that is not 4.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid contains the values [4, 4, 8], [6, 4, 3], [6, 3, 0]. The output grid is filled entirely with the value 4. Observing the input, 4 is the most frequent value in the grid.

2. In Example 2, the input grid contains the values [6, 8, 9], [1, 8, 1], [9, 4, 9]. The output grid is filled entirely with the value 9. Here, 9 is the most frequent value in the grid.

3. In Example 3, the input grid contains the values [4, 6, 9], [6, 4, 1], [8, 8, 6]. The output grid is filled entirely with the value 6. Here, 6 is the most frequent value in the grid.

From these examples, it appears that the transformation rule is to fill the entire output grid with the most frequent value from the input grid. If there is a tie for the most frequent value, the rule seems to select the highest value among the tied values.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test case input:
[
[8, 8, 6],
[4, 6, 9],
[8, 3, 0]

Counting the frequency of each value:
- 8 appears 3 times
- 6 appears 2 times
- 4 appears 1 time
- 9 appears 1 time
- 3 appears 1 time
- 0 appears 1 time

The most frequent value is 8. Therefore, the output grid should be filled entirely with the value 8.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid is a larger grid with a central pattern of '2's and other numbers. The output grid is a smaller grid that seems to focus on the central pattern of '2's, removing the surrounding '0's. The output grid retains the internal structure of the '2's and other numbers, but it is cropped to only include the central pattern.

2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the input grid has a central pattern of '2's and other numbers. The output grid is a smaller grid that focuses on the central pattern, removing the surrounding '0's. The internal structure of the '2's and other numbers is retained.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a central pattern of '2's and '8's. The output grid is a smaller grid that focuses on the central pattern, removing the surrounding '0's. The internal structure of the '2's and '8's is retained.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The output grid is a cropped version of the input grid, focusing on the central pattern of non-zero numbers.
- The output grid retains the internal structure of the non-zero numbers, removing the surrounding '0's.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

The test case input grid has a central pattern of '2's and other numbers. The output grid should be a smaller grid that focuses on this central pattern, removing the surrounding '0's. The internal structure of the '2's and other numbers should be retained.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Grid Size Change**: The output grid has fewer columns than the input grid. Specifically, the number of columns in the output grid is reduced by 2 compared to the input grid.

2. **Value Transformation**: The values in the output grid seem to be derived from the values in the input grid. However, the values are not directly copied. Instead, there appears to be a pattern in how the values are transformed.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - In Example 1, the value '5' in the input grid is transformed to '1' in the output grid.
   - In Example 2, the value '5' in the input grid is transformed to '1' in the output grid.
   - In Example 3, the value '5' in the input grid is transformed to '1' in the output grid.
   - In Example 4, the value '5' in the input grid is transformed to '1' in the output grid.

   This suggests that the value '5' in the input grid is consistently transformed to '1' in the output grid.

4. **Column Reduction**: The reduction in the number of columns suggests that the transformation rule might involve merging or dropping columns. Observing the examples, it appears that the first and last columns of the input grid are dropped in the output grid.

5. **Value Mapping**: Other values seem to be directly copied from the input grid to the output grid, except for the value '5', which is consistently transformed to '1'.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- Drop the first and last columns of the input grid.
- Transform the value '5' to '1' in the output grid.
- Copy all other values directly from the input grid to the output grid.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
```
[
[0, 5, 0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 8],
[2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 3, 0, 0, 8],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Applying the transformation rule:
1. Drop the first and last columns:
   ```
   [
   [5, 0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0],
   [2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 3, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ]
   ```

2. Transform the value '5' to '1':
   ```
   [
   [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
   [2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 3, 0],

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In both examples, the value '5' in the input grid is replaced by a sequence of numbers in the output grid. These numbers seem to increase as we move from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid.
2. The numbers start from '1' and increase sequentially. For instance, in Example 1, the first '5' encountered is replaced by '1', the next by '2', and so on.
3. The sequence of numbers appears to be based on the order in which the '5's are encountered when scanning the grid from top-left to bottom-right.

Given this reasoning, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- Replace each '5' in the input grid with a sequential number starting from '1', increasing as we encounter more '5's while scanning the grid from top-left to bottom-right.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

Test Case Input:

[0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0],
[0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0]
]

Applying the transformation rule:
- The first '5' encountered is replaced by '1'.
- The second '5' encountered is replaced by '2'.
- This continues sequentially.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the input is a single row with two '1's followed by zeros. The output adds rows where each new row extends the sequence of '1's by one more position to the right, until the row is filled with '1's up to the last non-zero value in the input.

2. In Example 2, the input is a single row with a '2' followed by zeros. The output adds rows where each new row extends the sequence of '2's by one more position to the right, until the row is filled with '2's up to the last non-zero value in the input.

3. In Example 3, the input is a single row with three '5's followed by zeros. The output adds rows where each new row extends the sequence of '5's by one more position to the right, until the row is filled with '5's up to the last non-zero value in the input.

4. In Example 4, the input is a single row with four '8's followed by zeros. The output adds rows where each new row extends the sequence of '8's by one more position to the right, until the row is filled with '8's up to the last non-zero value in the input.

5. In Example 5, the input is a single row with a '7' followed by zeros. The output adds rows where each new row extends the sequence of '7's by one more position to the right, until the row is filled with '7's up to the last non-zero value in the input.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each non-zero value in the input row, the output will have additional rows.
- Each new row will extend the sequence of the non-zero value by one more position to the right, until the row is filled with the non-zero value up to the last non-zero value in the input.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The input is a single row with three '1's followed by zeros.
- The output should add rows where each new row extends the sequence of '1's by one more position to the right, until the row is filled with '1's up to the last non-zero value in the input.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: A 3x3 grid with values [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2].
   - Output: A 6x6 grid where each value in the input grid is repeated in a 2x2 block. The value 2 is repeated in a 2x2 block, and the value 0 is replaced with a pattern of [8, 0, 8, 0].

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: A 6x6 grid with values [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has two distinct shapes: a small '8' shape and a larger '2' shape. The output grid is a smaller grid that captures the essence of these shapes. The '2' shape is represented as a border, and the '8' shape is placed inside it.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a '2' shape and a smaller '1' shape. The output grid again captures these shapes, with the '2' as a border and the '1' inside it.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a '2' shape and a '4' shape. The output grid captures these shapes similarly, with the '2' as a border and the '4' inside it.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The output grid is a smaller grid that captures the essence of the shapes in the input grid.
- The '2' shape is always represented as a border.
- Any other shapes (like '8', '1', '4', etc.) are placed inside the '2' border.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

The test case has a '2' shape and a '3' shape. The '2' shape will form the border, and the '3' shape will be placed inside it.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a block of 4s and a block of 5s. In the output, the block of 5s is shifted upwards, filling the space where the 5s were originally located with 0s. The block of 4s remains unchanged.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a block of 4s and a block of 2s. In the output, the block of 4s is shifted to the left, filling the space where the 4s were originally located with 0s. The block of 2s remains unchanged.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a block of 2s and a block of 3s. In the output, the block of 3s is shifted upwards, filling the space where the 3s were originally located with 0s. The block of 2s remains unchanged.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify the largest block of a single color (excluding 0).
- Shift this block upwards or to the left, depending on the orientation of the block, to fill the space where it was originally located with 0s.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The largest block is the block of 3s.
- The block of 3s should be shifted upwards, filling the space where it was originally located with 0s.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the examples provided:

1. **Example 1**: 
   - The input grid has a pattern of 0s, 8s, and other numbers.
   - The output grid shows that the 2s in the input are extended horizontally to fill the gaps between the 8s.
   - The 1s in the input are also extended horizontally in the same manner.

2. **Example 2**: 
   - The input grid has a pattern of 0s, 1s, and other numbers.
   - The output grid shows that the 2s and 9s in the input are extended horizontally to fill the gaps between the 1s.

3. **Example 3**: 
   - The input grid has a pattern of 0s, 4s, and other numbers.
   - The output grid shows that the 3s and 2s in the input are extended horizontally to fill the gaps between the 4s.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each row, if there are non-zero values (other than the dominant color, e.g., 8, 1, or 4) that are adjacent horizontally, these values are extended horizontally to fill the gaps between the dominant color.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- The dominant color in the test case is 4.
- The non-zero values other than 4 are 2, 3, and 8.
- These values should be extended horizontally to fill the gaps between the 4s.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a block of 5s surrounded by 0s.
   - The output grid shows that the 5s are replaced with a pattern of 1s and 4s, with 2s in the center.
   - The pattern seems to be a 3x3 block where the corners are 1s, the edges are 4s, and the center is 2s.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid has a larger block of 5s surrounded by 0s.
   - The output grid shows the same pattern of 1s, 4s, and 2s, but it is applied to the larger block.
   - The pattern is consistently applied to each 3x3 block of 5s.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Replace each 3x3 block of 5s with a 3x3 block of 1s, 4s, and 2s, where:
  - The corners are 1s.
  - The edges are 4s.
  - The center is 2s.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input contains a cluster of '1's and '4's. The output retains the '1's and '4's but also introduces new '1's around the '4's. This suggests that the transformation rule involves expanding the '4's into '1's in their immediate vicinity.

2. **Example 2**: The input has a cluster of '1's and '4's. The output retains the '1's and '4's and introduces new '1's around the '4's. This reinforces the idea that '4's are expanded into '1's.

3. **Example 3**: The input has a cluster of '1's and '4's. The output retains the '1's and '4's and introduces new '1's around the '4's. This further supports the expansion rule.

4. **Example 4**: The input has a cluster of '1's and '4's. The output retains the '1's and '4's and introduces new '1's around the '4's. This confirms the expansion rule.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Any '4' in the input grid is expanded into '1's in its immediate 8-neighborhood (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) in the output grid.
- All other values remain unchanged.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Observation of Color Changes**:
   - In all examples, the color '0' in the input grid is replaced by a different color in the output grid. This suggests that '0' is a special color that triggers a transformation.
   - The color '5' remains unchanged in most cases, indicating that it is a stable color under this transformation.

2. **Pattern of New Colors**:
   - The new colors (1, 2, 3) appear to be related to the number of '0's in the neighborhood of a cell. For example, if a '0' is surrounded by other '0's, it might be replaced by a higher number.
   - The color '1' seems to appear when a '0' is isolated or has fewer '0' neighbors.
   - The color '2' appears when a '0' has more '0' neighbors.
   - The color '3' appears when a '0' is surrounded by even more '0' neighbors.

3. **Neighborhood Analysis**:
   - The transformation appears to be based on the number of '0's in the 8-neighborhood (including diagonals) of each cell.
   - If a '0' has 0-1 '0' neighbors, it becomes '1'.
   - If a '0' has 2-3 '0' neighbors, it becomes '2'.
   - If a '0' has 4 or more '0' neighbors, it becomes '3'.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- For each '0' in the input grid, count the number of '0's in its 8-neighborhood.
- Replace the '0' with '1' if it has 0-1 '0' neighbors, '2' if it has 2-3 '0' neighbors, and '3' if it has 4 or more '0' neighbors.
- All other colors remain unchanged.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has three rows, each containing the same sequence of numbers. The output grid retains the same sequence but reduces the number of columns to one, keeping the first value of each row.

2. In Example 2, the input grid has three identical rows. The output grid retains the first row as it is, without any changes.

3. In Example 3, the input grid has three identical rows. The output grid retains the first row but removes the repeated values, keeping only the unique values in the order they appear.

4. In Example 4, the input grid has four rows, each containing two identical numbers. The output grid retains the first value of each row, reducing the number of columns to one.

5. In Example 5, the input grid has six rows, with the first two rows containing the same sequence of numbers, the next two rows containing a different sequence, and the last two rows containing yet another sequence. The output grid retains the first value of each unique sequence, reducing the number of rows to four.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- If all rows are identical, the output grid retains the first row but removes repeated values, keeping only the unique values in the order they appear.
- If the rows are not identical, the output grid retains the first value of each row, reducing the number of columns to one.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The test case has four identical rows. Therefore, the output grid should retain the first row but remove repeated values, keeping only the unique values in the order they appear.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has a pattern of 6s and 2s.
   - The output shifts the 6s and 2s one position to the right within their respective rows.
   - The rightmost 6 in the row moves to the leftmost position of the next row.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input has a pattern of 8s.
   - The output shifts the 8s one position to the right within their respective rows.
   - The rightmost 8 in the row moves to the leftmost position of the next row.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Shift all non-zero values one position to the right within their respective rows.
- If a non-zero value is at the rightmost position of a row, it moves to the leftmost position of the next row.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a pattern of '6's in the first four rows. The output grid is identical to the input grid except for the last row, where '4's appear in the 4th and 8th columns. This suggests that the '4's are placed in the last row, aligned with the columns where '6's are present in the first four rows.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a pattern of '3's in the first two rows. The output grid is identical to the input grid except for the last row, where a '4' appears in the 3rd column. This suggests that the '4' is placed in the last row, aligned with the column where '3's are present in the first two rows.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a pattern of '8's in the second and third rows and '6's in the third and fourth rows. The output grid is identical to the input grid except for the last row, where '4's appear in the 3rd and 7th columns. This suggests that the '4's are placed in the last row, aligned with the columns where '8's and '6's are present in the first four rows.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify the columns in the first four rows where non-zero values are present.
- In the last row of the output grid, place '4's in the columns that correspond to the columns identified in the first four rows.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has a central value of 5 surrounded by 4s. In the output, the central value remains 4, and the surrounding values are changed to 0. This suggests that the central value is preserved, and the surrounding values are set to 0.

2. In Example 2, the input grid has a pattern where the central value is 5, and the surrounding values are 6. In the output, the central value is preserved as 6, and the surrounding values are set to 0. This reinforces the idea that the central value is preserved, and the surrounding values are set to 0.

3. In Example 3, the input grid has a pattern where the central value is 9, and the surrounding values are 5. In the output, the central value is preserved as 9, and the surrounding values are set to 0. This further supports the idea that the central value is preserved, and the surrounding values are set to 0.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify the central value in the grid.
- Preserve the central value in the output.
- Set all other values in the grid to 0.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the provided examples.

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input and output grids are identical except for the bottom-right section.
   - In the output, the value '8' appears in a cluster of '2's, suggesting that '8' is replacing a specific pattern or condition.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input and output grids are identical except for the middle section.
   - In the output, the value '8' appears in a cluster of '0's, suggesting that '8' is replacing a specific pattern or condition.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input and output grids are identical except for the bottom section.
   - In the output, the value '4' appears in a cluster of '3's, suggesting that '4' is replacing a specific pattern or condition.

From these observations, it seems that the transformation rule involves replacing a specific pattern of values with a new value. Specifically:
- In Example 1, '8' replaces a cluster of '2's.
- In Example 2, '8' replaces a cluster of '0's.
- In Example 3, '4' replaces a cluster of '3's.

The rule appears to be: Replace a cluster of a specific value with a new value. The new value is determined by the value that is being replaced. For instance, '8' replaces '2's, '0's, etc.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- Look for clusters of the same value and replace them with a new value based on the value being replaced.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a single color (6) in the first column and zeros elsewhere. The output grid shows that the zeros are replaced by a sequence of numbers starting from 2 and increasing by 2 for each row, until the last row which is filled with 4s. The pattern seems to be that the zeros are replaced by a sequence of numbers starting from 2 and increasing by 2 for each row, and the last row is filled with 4s.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a single color (5) in the first column and zeros elsewhere. The output grid shows a similar pattern: zeros are replaced by a sequence of numbers starting from 2 and increasing by 2 for each row, and the last row is filled with 4s.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a single color (8) in the first column and zeros elsewhere. The output grid again shows the same pattern: zeros are replaced by a sequence of numbers starting from 2 and increasing by 2 for each row, and the last row is filled with 4s.

From these examples, we can deduce the following transformation rule:
- The zeros in the input grid are replaced by a sequence of numbers starting from 2 and increasing by 2 for each row.
- The last row is filled with 4s.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The test case has a single color (3) in the first column and zeros elsewhere.
- The zeros should be replaced by a sequence of numbers starting from 2 and increasing by 2 for each row.
- The last row should be filled with 4s.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a pattern of 3s and 2s forming a cross-like structure.
   - The output grid is a smaller grid with values 0, 3, and 0 arranged in a specific pattern.
   - The output grid seems to represent the central values of the input grid's cross structure.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid has a pattern of 8s, 2s, and 1s forming a cross-like structure.
   - The output grid is a smaller grid with values 0, 2, 1, and 3 arranged in a specific pattern.
   - The output grid again seems to represent the central values of the input grid's cross structure.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input grid has a pattern of 2s, 8s, and 4s forming a cross-like structure.
   - The output grid is a smaller grid with values 0, 8, and 4 arranged in a specific pattern.
   - The output grid represents the central values of the input grid's cross structure.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The output grid is a smaller grid that captures the central values of the input grid's cross-like structure.
- The central values are taken from the intersections of the cross-like structure in the input grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

- The test case input grid has a pattern of 1s, 8s, 3s, and 2s forming a cross-like structure.
- The central values of the cross-like structure are 1, 8, 3, and 2.

Therefore, the output grid should be:

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has three distinct colors: 4, 2, and 8. The output grid is a 1x3 grid containing these three colors in the order they appear in the input grid. This suggests that the transformation rule might be extracting the unique colors from the input grid and placing them in a single row in the order they appear.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has three distinct colors: 2, 8, and 5. The output grid is a 3x1 grid containing these three colors in the order they appear in the input grid. This suggests that the transformation rule might be extracting the unique colors from the input grid and placing them in a single column in the order they appear.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has four distinct colors: 6, 4, 2, and 3. The output grid is a 4x1 grid containing these four colors in the order they appear in the input grid. This further supports the idea that the transformation rule is extracting the unique colors from the input grid and placing them in a single column in the order they appear.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Extract the unique colors from the input grid.
- Place these unique colors in a single column in the order they appear in the input grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. In Example 1, the input grid is expanded from a 3x3 to a 3x6 grid. The pattern seems to be that each row is duplicated and mirrored in a specific way. For instance, the first row [6, 6, 6] becomes [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], which is simply the row repeated. The second row [1, 6, 1] becomes [1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1], which is the row followed by its mirror image. The third row [8, 8, 6] becomes [8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8], which is the row followed by its mirror image.

2. In Example 2, the same pattern is observed. The first row [6, 8, 1] becomes [6, 8, 1, 1, 8, 6], which is the row followed by its mirror image. The second row [6, 1, 1] becomes [6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6], which is the row followed by its mirror image. The third row [1, 1, 6] becomes [1, 1, 6, 6, 1, 1], which is the row followed by its mirror image.

3. In Example 3 and Example 4, the same pattern is consistently applied. Each row is followed by its mirror image, effectively doubling the length of each row.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be: for each row in the input grid, append the mirror image of that row to the end of the row. This results in each row being doubled in length.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test case input:
[
[6, 8, 6],
[8, 6, 8],
[1, 6, 1]
]

Applying the rule:
- The first row [6, 8, 6] becomes [6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 6].
- The second row [8, 6, 8] becomes [8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8].
- The third row [1, 6, 1] becomes [1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1].

Therefore, the output for the test case should be:

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has a few '7's scattered in the grid.
   - The output shows that these '7's have been shifted diagonally towards the top-left corner of the grid. Each '7' moves one position up and one position to the left.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input has a few '9's scattered in the grid.
   - The output shows that these '9's have also been shifted diagonally towards the top-left corner of the grid. Each '9' moves one position up and one position to the left.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Each non-zero value in the input grid is shifted one position up and one position to the left in the output grid. If this shift causes the value to move out of the grid boundaries, it wraps around to the opposite side of the grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: The grid has a mix of 1s, 0s, 4s, and 2s.
   - Output: The output grid is 4x4 and contains only 3s and 0s.
   - Observations: The output grid seems to be a 4x4 grid derived from the first 4 rows of the input. The value 3 appears where there is a 1 in the input, and 0 appears where there is a 0 in the input.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Similar structure with 1s, 0s, 4s, and 2s.
   - Output: Again, a 4x4 grid with 3s and 0s.
   - Observations: The same pattern as Example 1 is observed. The output grid is derived from the first 4 rows of the input, with 3s replacing 1s and 0s remaining as 0s.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: Contains 1s, 0s, 4s, and 2s.
   - Output: A 4x4 grid with 3s and 0s.
   - Observations: The pattern is consistent. The output grid is derived from the first 4 rows of the input, with 3s replacing 1s and 0s remaining as 0s.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: Contains 1s, 0s, 4s, and 2s.
   - Output: A 4x4 grid with 3s and 0s.
   - Observations: The pattern is consistent. The output grid is derived from the first 4 rows of the input, with 3s replacing 1s and 0s remaining as 0s.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The output grid is a 4x4 grid derived from the first 4 rows of the input.
- In the output grid, all 1s in the input are replaced with 3s.
- All 0s in the input remain as 0s.
- Other values (like 4s and 2s) are not present in the first 4 rows of the input, so they do not affect the output.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input has a small cluster of '1's and a few '5's scattered around. In the output, the '1's are expanded to form a larger cluster, and the '5's remain unchanged. The expansion seems to be symmetric around the original '1' cluster.

2. **Example 2**: The input has a cluster of '3's and a few '5's. The output shows the '3's expanded symmetrically, while the '5's remain unchanged.

3. **Example 3**: The input has a cluster of '4's and a few '5's. The output shows the '4's expanded symmetrically, while the '5's remain unchanged.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Any non-zero value (except '5') in the input grid is expanded symmetrically to form a larger cluster of the same value.
- The value '5' remains unchanged in the output.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The '8's will be expanded symmetrically.
- The '5's will remain unchanged.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input has two '4's in the 4th and 6th rows, 4th and 6th columns. The output adds a '2' in the 5th row, 5th column, which is the center between the two '4's.
2. **Example 2**: The input has two '4's in the 2nd and 7th rows, 2nd and 7th columns. The output adds a '2' in the 3rd to 6th rows, 3rd to 6th columns, forming a square around the '4's.
3. **Example 3**: The input has multiple '4's. The output adds '2's in the center between the '4's in the same rows and columns.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify pairs of '4's in the same row or column.
- Add '2's in the center between these '4's, forming a square if the '4's are in different rows and columns.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: 8x8 grid
   - Output: 4x4 grid
   - The output grid appears to be a reduced version of the input grid, where each 2x2 block in the input is condensed into a single cell in the output. The value in the output cell is the maximum value from the corresponding 2x2 block in the input.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: 6x6 grid
   - Output: 3x2 grid
   - The same pattern is observed: each 2x2 block in the input is condensed into a single cell in the output, with the output cell value being the maximum value from the corresponding 2x2 block in the input.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: 8x8 grid
   - Output: 4x4 grid
   - Again, each 2x2 block in the input is condensed into a single cell in the output, with the output cell value being the maximum value from the corresponding 2x2 block in the input.

From these observations, the transformation rule is:
- Divide the input grid into 2x2 blocks.
- For each 2x2 block, the output cell value is the maximum value from that block.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid is a large square with a smaller square of different colors in the center. The output grid is a smaller version of the central square, with the outermost layer of the original square forming a border around it. The central square is reduced in size, keeping the relative positions of the colors intact.

2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the input grid has a central square of a different color, and the output grid is a smaller version of this central square with a border of the outermost color.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a central square with multiple colors, and the output grid is a smaller version of this central square, maintaining the relative positions of the colors and bordered by the outermost color.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify the central square of different colors.
- Reduce the size of this central square while maintaining the relative positions of the colors.
- Form a border around the reduced central square using the outermost color of the original grid.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The central square is the area with colors 1, 3, and 8.
- Reduce the size of this central square while maintaining the relative positions of the colors.
- Form a border around the reduced central square using the outermost color, which is 2.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. In Example 1, the only change is in the 5th row, where the 2nd and 7th elements are changed from 1 to 4. This suggests that if a row has a non-zero value that is not 1, it is copied to the next occurrence of a non-zero value in the same row.

2. In Example 2, the 2nd row changes from [1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3] to [1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3]. The 3rd element (3) is copied to the 5th element. This reinforces the idea that non-zero values are copied to the next non-zero value in the same row.

3. In Example 3, the 5th row changes from [3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1] to [3, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1]. The 1st element (3) is copied to the 4th and 7th elements. This further supports the copying rule.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be: For each row, if there is a non-zero value that is not 1, it is copied to the next occurrence of a non-zero value in the same row.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input has a small cluster of '3's and '1's, and a larger cluster of '4's and '1's. In the output, the '4's and '1's cluster is expanded to include the surrounding '0's, forming a larger rectangular block.

2. **Example 2**: The input has a cluster of '2', '8', and '6'. The output shows that the '6' cluster is expanded to include the surrounding '0's, forming a larger rectangular block.

3. **Example 3**: The input has a cluster of '1', '4', and '8'. The output shows that the '8' cluster is expanded to include the surrounding '0's, forming a larger rectangular block.

4. **Example 4**: The input has a cluster of '3', '2', '8', '4', and '2'. The output shows that the '2' and '4' clusters are expanded to include the surrounding '0's, forming larger rectangular blocks.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify clusters of non-zero values.
- Expand these clusters to include the surrounding '0's, forming larger rectangular blocks.

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a large area filled with '1's and a smaller area with various numbers (3, 1, 7, 2, 8, 9, 4, 6).
   - The output grid is a 3x3 grid containing only the numbers from the smaller area (3, 0, 7, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 6).

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid has a large area filled with '3's and a smaller area with various numbers (2, 1, 7, 4, 8, 9, 8, 6, 1).
   - The output grid is a 3x3 grid containing only the numbers from the smaller area (2, 0, 7, 4, 8, 0, 0, 6, 1).

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input grid has a large area filled with '8's and a smaller area with various numbers (4, 1, 9, 4, 6, 3, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7, 5, 2, 4, 2, 7).
   - The output grid is a 4x4 grid containing only the numbers from the smaller area (4, 0, 9, 4, 6, 0, 6, 0, 3, 0, 0, 5, 2, 4, 2, 0).

From these examples, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- The output grid contains only the numbers from the smaller area in the input grid.
- The size of the output grid is determined by the number of distinct numbers in the smaller area.
- The numbers are arranged in the same relative positions as they appear in the smaller area of the input grid.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The test case has a large area filled with '2's and a smaller area with various numbers (4, 8, 6, 3, 9, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7, 4, 1, 5, 8, 1).
- The output grid should be a 5x3 grid containing only the numbers from the smaller area in the same relative positions.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     [
     [1, 2],
     [3, 8]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [0, 1, 2, 0],
     [1, 1, 2, 2],
     [3, 3, 8, 8],
     [0, 3, 8, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Observations:
     - The output grid has an additional row and column on each side compared to the input grid.
     - The outermost layer of the output grid is filled with zeros.
     - The inner part of the output grid is filled with the values from the input grid, with each value being repeated horizontally and vertically.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [1, 8, 4],
     [8, 3, 8]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [0, 1, 8, 4, 0],
     [1, 1, 8, 4, 4],
     [8, 8, 3, 8, 8],
     [0, 8, 3, 8, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Observations:
     - Similar to Example 1, the output grid has an additional row and column on each side, filled with zeros.
     - The inner part of the output grid repeats the values from the input grid horizontally and vertically.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [
     [2, 1, 4],
     [8, 0, 2],
     [3, 2, 8]
     ]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [
     [0, 2, 1, 4, 0],
     [2, 2, 1, 4, 4],
     [8, 8, 0, 2, 2],
     [3, 3, 2, 8, 8],
     [0, 3, 2, 8, 0]
     ]
     ```
   - Observations:
     - The same pattern is observed: an additional row and column on each side filled with zeros, and the inner part repeating the input values.

From these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- Add an extra row and column on each side of the input grid, filling them with zeros.
- For the inner part of the output grid, each value from the input grid is repeated horizontally and vertically.

</reasoning>

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the test case:

Test Case:
```
[
[2, 8],
[1, 4],
[3, 4]
]
```

Applying the transformation rule:
1. Add an extra row and column on each side, filled with zeros.
2. Repeat each value from the input grid horizontally and vertically.

The resulting output is:
```
[
[0, 2, 8, 0],
[2, 2, 8, 8],
[1, 1, 4, 4],

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a size of 12x11, and the output grid is 5x5.
   - The output grid seems to be a smaller representation of the input grid, focusing on the non-3 values.
   - The output grid appears to be a condensed version of the input grid, where each value in the output corresponds to a block of values in the input.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid is 10x8, and the output grid is 3x3.
   - The output grid again seems to be a condensed version of the input grid, focusing on the non-1 values.
   - The output grid values seem to be derived from the central values of blocks in the input grid.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input grid is 12x14, and the output grid is 5x5.
   - The output grid is a condensed version of the input grid, focusing on the non-4 values.
   - The output grid values seem to be derived from the central values of blocks in the input grid.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The output grid is a condensed version of the input grid.
- Each value in the output grid corresponds to a block of values in the input grid.
- The value in the output grid is the central value of the corresponding block in the input grid, ignoring the most common value in the block (which seems to be the background color).

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The input grid is 19x19.
- The output grid will be 5x5.
- Each value in the output grid corresponds to a 4x4 block in the input grid.
- The value in the output grid is the central value of the corresponding block in the input grid, ignoring the most common value in the block (which is 8).

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input has a '2' in the center. The output shifts this '2' up by one row and changes the '0' above it to '4'. This suggests that any non-zero value shifts up by one row and the position it vacates is filled with '4'.

2. **Example 2**: The input has a '6' in the center. The output shifts this '6' up by one row and fills the vacated position with '4'. Additionally, the '4's appear in a pattern above the '6', suggesting that the '4's are filling the rows above the non-zero value.

3. **Example 3**: The input has a '9' in the center. The output shifts this '9' up by one row and fills the vacated position with '4'. The '4's appear in a pattern above the '9', similar to Example 2.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Any non-zero value shifts up by one row.
- The vacated position is filled with '4'.
- '4's are filled in the rows above the non-zero value in a pattern.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The '3' in the test case will shift up by one row.
- The vacated position will be filled with '4'.
- '4's will fill the rows above the '3' in a pattern.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid is a 15x15 grid with a pattern of 3s and 7s. The output is a 2x4 grid of 3s. The output grid seems to be a smaller version of the input grid, focusing on the central part of the input grid where the majority of the values are 3s.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid is a 11x11 grid with a pattern of 1s and 8s. The output is a 3x2 grid of 1s. Similar to Example 1, the output grid is a smaller version of the input grid, focusing on the central part where the majority of the values are 1s.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid is a 27x27 grid with a pattern of 3s and 1s. The output is a 6x5 grid of 3s. Again, the output grid is a smaller version of the input grid, focusing on the central part where the majority of the values are 3s.

From these examples, it appears that the transformation rule involves extracting a smaller grid from the center of the input grid, where the majority of the values are the same. The size of the output grid seems to be determined by the size of the central region with the same value.

For the test case, the input grid is a 22x22 grid with a pattern of 1s and 5s. The central part of the grid is mostly 1s. Therefore, the output grid should be a smaller grid extracted from the central part of the input grid, where the majority of the values are 1s.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has a pattern of the number 2, and the output grid has the same pattern but with the number 4. The number 4 is the next color in the sequence after 2 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...).

2. In Example 2, the input grid has a pattern of the number 3, and the output grid has the same pattern but with the number 6. The number 6 is the next color in the sequence after 3 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...).

From these observations, it appears that the transformation rule is to replace each non-zero number in the input grid with the next color in the sequence. For instance, if the input grid has a pattern of the number 8, the output grid will have the same pattern but with the number 10 (the next color after 8).

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

The test case has a pattern of the number 8. According to the rule, we should replace each 8 with the next color in the sequence, which is 10.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Example 1**: 
   - The grid has multiple colored regions (8s, 3s, 6s, and 7s).
   - In the output, the 8s and 6s have their middle sections replaced with 0s, while the 3s and 7s remain unchanged.
   - The middle section appears to be the central portion of the colored region, excluding the outermost layer.

2. **Example 2**: 
   - The grid has a single colored region (2s).
   - In the output, the middle section of the 2s is replaced with 0s, leaving the outermost layer intact.

3. **Example 3**: 
   - The grid has two colored regions (5s and 4s).
   - In the output, the middle sections of both the 5s and 4s are replaced with 0s, leaving the outermost layer intact.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each colored region, the middle section (excluding the outermost layer) is replaced with 0s.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a pattern of 8s and 0s. In the output, the 8s remain unchanged, while the 0s are replaced with either 3s or 4s. The 3s and 4s seem to be distributed in a way that depends on the surrounding 8s. Specifically, the 0s that are closer to the top-left corner of the grid are replaced with 3s, while the 0s closer to the bottom-right corner are replaced with 4s.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a pattern of 1s and 0s. In the output, the 1s remain unchanged, while the 0s are replaced with either 3s or 4s. The same pattern of 3s and 4s is observed as in Example 1, with 3s closer to the top-left and 4s closer to the bottom-right.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a pattern of 9s and 0s. In the output, the 9s remain unchanged, while the 0s are replaced with either 3s or 4s. The same pattern of 3s and 4s is observed as in the previous examples.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The non-zero values (8, 1, 9) remain unchanged.
- The 0s are replaced with either 3s or 4s depending on their position in the grid. Specifically, 0s closer to the top-left corner are replaced with 3s, and 0s closer to the bottom-right corner are replaced with 4s.

To solve the test case, we will apply this rule to the given input grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: A grid with a central row of 8s and other scattered 6s and 0s.
   - Output: A 3x3 grid with values [1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0].
   - Observations: The output grid seems to represent the presence of 6s in specific regions of the input grid. The 1s in the output grid correspond to the presence of 6s in the input grid.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Similar structure with a central row of 8s and scattered 6s and 0s.
   - Output: A 3x3 grid with values [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0].
   - Observations: The 1s in the output grid again correspond to the presence of 6s in the input grid, but in different positions.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: Another grid with a central row of 8s and scattered 6s and 0s.
   - Output: A 3x3 grid with values [0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1].
   - Observations: The pattern continues, with 1s in the output grid indicating the presence of 6s in the input grid.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: A grid with a central row of 8s and scattered 6s and 0s.
   - Output: A 3x3 grid with values [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0].
   - Observations: The same pattern is observed, with 1s indicating the presence of 6s.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The output grid is a 3x3 representation of the presence of 6s in specific regions of the input grid.
- Each cell in the output grid corresponds to a specific region in the input grid, and a 1 indicates the presence of at least one 6 in that region.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

- The test case input grid has 6s in various positions.
- We need to map these positions to the 3x3 output grid.

By examining the positions of 6s in the test case input grid, we can determine the corresponding 1s in the output grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Example 1**: 
   - The input has a pattern of 5s forming a shape with some gaps.
   - The output shows that the gaps within the shape (surrounded by 5s) are filled with 2s.
   
2. **Example 2**: 
   - The input has a more complex pattern of 5s with multiple gaps.
   - The output shows that the gaps within the shape are filled with 2s, but only if they are completely surrounded by 5s.

3. **Example 3**: 
   - The input has a pattern with a smaller gap within a larger shape.
   - The output shows that the smaller gap is filled with 2s.

4. **Example 4**: 
   - The input has a pattern with no gaps within the shape.
   - The output shows no changes, indicating that the rule only applies when there are gaps within the shape.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- **Fill gaps within a shape of 5s with 2s if the gaps are completely surrounded by 5s.**

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has several '3's. In the output, these '3's are replaced with '8's, except for the '3's that are on the border of the grid.
2. In Example 2, the same pattern is observed. '3's that are not on the border are replaced with '8's.
3. In Example 3, the same rule applies. '3's that are not on the border are replaced with '8's.
4. In Example 4, the same rule is consistently applied. '3's that are not on the border are replaced with '8's.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Any '3' that is not on the border of the grid is replaced with '8'.
- '3's that are on the border of the grid remain as '3'.
- All other values remain unchanged.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid is a 3x3 matrix, and the output grid is a 3x6 matrix. Each row in the output grid is a concatenation of the corresponding row in the input grid with itself.
2. In Example 2, the input grid is a 4x3 matrix, and the output grid is a 4x6 matrix. Again, each row in the output grid is a concatenation of the corresponding row in the input grid with itself.
3. In Example 3, the input grid is a 4x4 matrix, and the output grid is a 4x8 matrix. Each row in the output grid is a concatenation of the corresponding row in the input grid with itself.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be that each row in the input grid is duplicated and concatenated to itself to form the corresponding row in the output grid. The number of columns in the output grid is twice the number of columns in the input grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In all examples, the output grid has a smaller size compared to the input grid. The output grid is 5x3, while the input grid is 5x7.
2. The output grid contains only two values: 0 and 8. This suggests that the transformation rule is likely based on a specific condition that results in either 0 or 8.
3. Observing the positions of 8s in the output grids, it appears that they are placed where the input grid has a specific pattern. Specifically, an 8 appears in the output grid when the corresponding column in the input grid has a '1' surrounded by '9's in the same row.
4. The '1' in the input grid seems to act as a trigger for the transformation, and the '9's surrounding it determine the placement of '8's in the output grid.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- For each row in the output grid, check the corresponding row in the input grid.
- If a '1' is found in the input grid and it is surrounded by '9's in the same row, place an '8' in the corresponding position in the output grid. Otherwise, place a '0'.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

1. **Observation of the 5s**: In all examples, the number 5 appears in a row or column that is entirely filled with 5s. This suggests that the transformation rule preserves the 5s in their original positions.

2. **Grouping of Colors**: In the output grids, non-5 values are grouped together in blocks of three. This indicates that the transformation rule groups non-5 values into blocks of three, repeating the same value within each block.

3. **Preservation of 5s**: The 5s remain unchanged and occupy the same positions in the output as they do in the input.

4. **Grouping Logic**: For each group of three non-5 values in the input, the output assigns the same value to all three positions within that group. This value is determined by the first non-5 value encountered in the group.

Given these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- Preserve the 5s in their original positions.
- Group non-5 values into blocks of three, repeating the first non-5 value within each block.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid is expanded by duplicating the rows and columns. The first four rows and columns are repeated, and the last row and column are filled with the value 2. This suggests that the transformation involves duplicating the grid and filling the new rows and columns with a specific value.

2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the grid is expanded by duplicating the rows and columns. The first four rows and columns are repeated, and the last row and column are filled with the value 1. This reinforces the idea that the transformation involves duplicating the grid and filling the new rows and columns with a specific value.

3. **Example 3**: The grid is expanded by duplicating the rows and columns. The first four rows and columns are repeated, and the last row and column are filled with the value 6. This further supports the idea that the transformation involves duplicating the grid and filling the new rows and columns with a specific value.

From these examples, we can infer that the transformation rule is:
- Duplicate the grid by repeating the rows and columns.
- Fill the new rows and columns with the value of the last non-zero element in the original grid.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The test case grid is:
  [
  [7, 7, 3, 2, 2],
  [7, 7, 3, 2, 2],
  [3, 3, 3, 2, 2],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  ]
- The last non-zero element in the original grid is 2.
- Duplicate the grid and fill the new rows and columns with the value 2.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has several clusters of '1's. In the output, these clusters of '1's are replaced by '3's. The '1's that are not part of a cluster remain as '1's.
2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the clusters of '1's are replaced by '3's, while isolated '1's remain unchanged.
3. **Example 3**: Again, clusters of '1's are replaced by '3's, and isolated '1's remain as '1's.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Any '1' that is part of a cluster (i.e., adjacent to other '1's either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) is changed to '3'.
- Any '1' that is isolated (i.e., not adjacent to any other '1') remains as '1'.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a large area of color 8 with smaller areas of colors 1, 2, and 3. In the output, the color 8 remains unchanged, but the smaller areas of colors 1, 2, and 3 are transformed. Specifically, the color 3 is replaced by a pattern of 2s and 3s, and the color 2 is replaced by a pattern of 2s and 3s as well.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a large area of color 1 with smaller areas of colors 2, 3, and 4. In the output, the color 1 remains unchanged, but the smaller areas of colors 2, 3, and 4 are transformed. Specifically, the color 4 is replaced by a pattern of 3s and 4s, and the color 2 is replaced by a pattern of 2s and 3s.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a large area of color 8 with smaller areas of colors 3, 4, 5, and 6. In the output, the color 8 remains unchanged, but the smaller areas of colors 3, 4, 5, and 6 are transformed. Specifically, the color 4 is replaced by a pattern of 3s and 4s, and the color 3 is replaced by a pattern of 2s and 3s.

From these examples, we can infer the following transformation rule:
- The largest area of a single color remains unchanged.
- Smaller areas of different colors are transformed into a pattern that includes the original color and the next higher color in the sequence.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The largest area is color 4, which remains unchanged.
- The smaller areas of colors 1, 2, and 3 are transformed into patterns that include the original color and the next higher color in the sequence.

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input is a 16x16 grid.
   - The output is a 5x5 grid.
   - The output grid seems to be a central portion of the input grid, specifically the central 5x5 section.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input is a 16x16 grid.
   - The output is a 5x5 grid.
   - Similar to Example 1, the output grid appears to be the central 5x5 section of the input grid.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input is a 16x16 grid.
   - The output is a 5x5 grid.
   - Again, the output grid is the central 5x5 section of the input grid.

From these observations, the transformation rule seems to be extracting the central 5x5 section of the 16x16 input grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

- The test case is a 16x16 grid.
- We need to extract the central 5x5 section.

The central 5x5 section of a 16x16 grid is located from row 6 to row 10 and column 6 to column 10 (0-based indexing).

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid is 4x8, and the output grid is 4x4. The output grid is essentially the first half of each row from the input grid.
2. **Example 2**: The input grid is 3x6, and the output grid is 3x3. Again, the output grid is the first half of each row from the input grid.
3. **Example 3**: The input grid is 6x2, and the output grid is 3x2. Here, the output grid is the first half of the rows from the input grid.

From these examples, it appears that the transformation rule is to take the first half of each row from the input grid to form the output grid. If the number of columns in the input grid is even, the first half is straightforward. If the number of rows is even, the first half of the rows is taken.

Applying this rule to the test case:

The test case input grid is 8x3. Since the number of rows is even, we take the first half of the rows (the first 4 rows) and keep all columns as they are.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid contains multiple colors, but the output is a single cell with the value 2. Observing the input, the value 2 appears multiple times, and it seems to be the most frequent non-zero value in the grid.

2. In Example 2, the input grid has the value 8 appearing multiple times, and the output is a single cell with the value 8. This suggests that the most frequent non-zero value in the grid is being selected.

3. In Example 3, the value 1 appears multiple times, and the output is a single cell with the value 1. This further supports the idea that the most frequent non-zero value is being selected.

4. In Example 4, the value 8 appears multiple times, and the output is a single cell with the value 8. This confirms the pattern.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be: Identify the most frequent non-zero value in the input grid and return a single-cell grid containing that value.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

The test case input grid contains the following non-zero values: 1 and 4. Counting the occurrences:
- The value 1 appears 15 times.
- The value 4 appears 12 times.

Since 1 is the most frequent non-zero value, the output should be a single cell with the value 1.

   - The output shows that the first two columns of 0s are changed to 1s.
   - The middle section of 0s is changed to 2s.
   - The last two columns of 0s are changed to 3s.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input has a similar pattern of 0s and 5s.
   - The output shows that the first three columns of 0s are changed to 1s.
   - The middle section of 0s is changed to 2s.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input has two 8s in the top-left corner. In the output, these 8s are replaced by 2s, but they are shifted down by one row.
2. In Example 2, the input has a single 8 in the middle of the top row. In the output, this 8 is replaced by a 2, and it is shifted down by one row.
3. In Example 3, the input has three 8s in the middle row. In the output, these 8s are replaced by 2s, and they are shifted down by one row.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Any 8 in the input grid is replaced by a 2 in the output grid.
- The position of the 2 in the output grid is one row below the position of the 8 in the input grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

[0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Applying the transformation rule:
- The 8 in the first row, third column becomes a 2 in the second row, third column.
- The 8s in the second row, second and third columns become 2s in the third row, second and third columns.
- The 8 in the third row, third column becomes a 2 in the fourth row, third column.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. In all examples, the transformation rule seems to affect only the squares that are part of a continuous vertical line of the same color (in this case, color 2). 
2. The rule appears to change the color of these squares to 8, starting from the second square in the vertical line and continuing downwards.
3. The first square in the vertical line remains unchanged, while all subsequent squares in the line are changed to 8.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- The first vertical line of 2s starts at row 1 and continues to row 11. The first square (row 1) remains 2, and all subsequent squares in this line are changed to 8.
- The second vertical line of 2s starts at row 3 and continues to row 11. The first square (row 3) remains 2, and all subsequent squares in this line are changed to 8.
- The third vertical line of 2s starts at row 7 and continues to row 11. The first square (row 7) remains 2, and all subsequent squares in this line are changed to 8.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Symmetry Observation**: In all examples, the output grid appears to be a mirror image of the input grid along the vertical axis. This means that the left half of the grid is reflected onto the right half.

2. **Verification**: Let's verify this by checking a few examples:
   - In Example 1, the left half of the grid is mirrored onto the right half.
   - In Example 2, the same pattern is observed.
   - In Example 3 and Example 4, the same pattern is consistently observed.

3. **Test Case Application**: Given the test case, we should apply the same rule: mirror the left half of the grid onto the right half.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has 3 rows.
   - The output grid has 9 rows, which is 3 times the number of rows in the input.
   - The pattern of the rows in the output grid repeats the input rows in a specific sequence: the first row of the input is followed by the second row, then the third row, and this sequence repeats three times.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid has 4 rows.
   - The output grid has 13 rows, which is 3 times the number of rows in the input plus 1.
   - The pattern of the rows in the output grid repeats the input rows in a similar sequence: the first row of the input is followed by the second row, then the third row, and this sequence repeats three times, with an additional row at the end.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The output grid is formed by repeating the sequence of rows from the input grid three times.
- If the number of rows in the input grid is not a multiple of 3, an additional row is added at the end.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The test case input grid has 5 rows.
- The output grid should have 15 rows (3 times 5).
- The sequence of rows in the output grid should repeat the input rows three times.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has a block of '2's and a block of '7's. The output grid shows that a new block of '8's has been added in the empty space between the '2's and '7's. The '8's are placed in the rows directly below the '2's and above the '7's, forming a rectangular block.

2. In Example 2, the input grid has a block of '4's and a block of '6's. The output grid shows a new block of '8's added in the empty space between the '4's and '6's. The '8's are placed in the rows directly below the '4's and above the '6's, forming a rectangular block.

3. In Example 3, the input grid has a block of '3's and a block of '9's. The output grid shows a new block of '8's added in the empty space between the '3's and '9's. The '8's are placed in the rows directly below the '3's and above the '9's, forming a rectangular block.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify the blocks of non-zero numbers in the input grid.
- Find the empty space (filled with '0's) between these blocks.
- Fill this empty space with '8's, forming a rectangular block that spans the width of the empty space and the height between the blocks.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has a single '1' in the last row, first column. The output grid shows a pattern where '1' is shifted to the right in each row, wrapping around to the first column after the last column.

2. In Example 2, the input grid has a single '1' in the last row, first column. The output grid shows a similar pattern where '1' is shifted to the right in each row, wrapping around to the first column after the last column.

3. In Example 3, the input grid has a single '1' in the last row, first column. The output grid shows the same pattern where '1' is shifted to the right in each row, wrapping around to the first column after the last column.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The '1' in the input grid is shifted to the right in each row of the output grid.
- If the '1' reaches the last column, it wraps around to the first column of the next row.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The '1' in the last row, first column will shift to the right in each row, wrapping around to the first column after the last column.

  Here, the value 8 appears in the top row of the output grid because it is the only non-zero value in the central row of the input's central 3x3 section.

- In Example 2, the central 3x3 section of the input grid is:
  ```
  [0, 0, 0],
  [5, 8, 5],
  [5, 8, 5]
  ```
  The output grid is:
  ```
  [8, 8, 8],
  [0, 0, 8],
  [0, 0, 0]
  ```
  Here, the value 8 appears in the top row and the third column of the second row of the output grid because it is the only non-zero value in the central row and the third column of the input's central 3x3 section.

- In Example 3, the central 3x3 section of the input grid is:
  ```
  [0, 0, 0],
  [5, 8, 5],
  [5, 8, 5]
  ```
  The output grid is:
  ```
  [8, 8, 8],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
  ```
  Here, the value 8 appears in the top row of the output grid because it is the only non-zero value in the central row of the input's central 3x3 section.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The top row of the output grid is filled with the value from the central row of the central 3x3 section of the input grid.
- The second row of the output grid is filled with the value from the central column of the central 3x3 section of the input grid.
- The third row of the output grid is filled with the value from the bottom row of the central 3x3 section of the input grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.
</reasoning>

The central 3x3 section of the test case input grid is:
```
[0, 0, 0],
[5, 8, 5],
[5, 8, 5]
```

Applying the transformation rule:
- The top row of the output grid is [8, 8, 8] because the central row of the input's central 3x3 section is [5, 8, 5].
- The second row of the output grid is [0, 0, 8] because the central column of the input's central 3x3 section is [0, 8, 8].
- The third row of the output grid is [0, 0, 0] because the bottom row of the input's central 3x3 section is [5, 8, 5].

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid is a 3x3 matrix, and the output grid is a 6x6 matrix. Each element in the input grid is duplicated both horizontally and vertically, resulting in a 2x2 block of the same value in the output grid.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid is a 2x2 matrix, and the output grid is a 4x4 matrix. Again, each element in the input grid is duplicated both horizontally and vertically, forming a 2x2 block of the same value in the output grid.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid is a 4x4 matrix, and the output grid is an 8x8 matrix. The same pattern is observed: each element in the input grid is duplicated both horizontally and vertically, creating a 2x2 block of the same value in the output grid.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- Each element in the input grid is duplicated both horizontally and vertically, forming a 2x2 block of the same value in the output grid.
- The size of the output grid is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The input grid is a 5x5 matrix.
- The output grid will be a 10x10 matrix.
- Each element in the input grid will be duplicated both horizontally and vertically to form a 2x2 block in the output grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has a '2' at position (1, 4) and a '3' at position (13, 10). In the output, the '2' remains at the same position, but a new value '8' appears in a vertical line extending from the '2' down to the '3'. The '3' also remains in its original position.

2. In Example 2, the input grid has a '2' at position (7, 1) and a '3' at position (1, 11). In the output, the '2' remains at the same position, and a new value '8' appears in a vertical line extending from the '2' up to the '3'. The '3' also remains in its original position.

3. In Example 3, the input grid has a '2' at position (1, 11) and a '3' at position (10, 4). In the output, the '2' remains at the same position, and a new value '8' appears in a vertical line extending from the '2' down to the '3'. The '3' also remains in its original position.

From these examples, we can deduce the following transformation rule:
- The original values '2' and '3' remain in their positions.
- A new value '8' is placed in a vertical line connecting the '2' and '3'. The '8' values fill the vertical space between the '2' and '3', ensuring that the '8' values are placed in the same column as the '2' and '3'.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid is transformed by repeating the rows in a specific pattern. The first row is repeated at the end, the second row is repeated in the middle, and the third row is repeated at the beginning.
2. **Example 2**: The same pattern is observed. The first row is repeated at the end, the second row is repeated in the middle, and the third row is repeated at the beginning.
3. **Example 3**: The pattern is consistent. The first row is repeated at the end, the second row is repeated in the middle, and the third row is repeated at the beginning.
4. **Example 4**: The pattern holds. The first row is repeated at the end, the second row is repeated in the middle, and the third row is repeated at the beginning.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The first row of the input grid is repeated at the end of the output grid.
- The second row of the input grid is repeated in the middle of the output grid.
- The third row of the input grid is repeated at the beginning of the output grid.

This pattern is consistent across all examples.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a few colored squares (values 1 and 2). In the output, the colored squares remain the same, but additional squares around them are filled with the value 1. This suggests that the transformation rule involves expanding the colored regions by adding adjacent squares with a specific value.

2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the colored squares (values 1 and 2) are expanded in the output. The value 1 is added to the squares adjacent to the existing colored squares.

3. **Example 3**: The same pattern is observed. The colored squares (values 1 and 2) are expanded by adding adjacent squares with the value 1.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each colored square (non-zero value), expand the region by adding adjacent squares (up, down, left, right) with the value 1, unless the adjacent square already has a non-zero value.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has 1s at certain positions. The output grid shows that these 1s remain unchanged, but the squares directly adjacent to these 1s (horizontally and vertically) are changed to 2s. Squares that are not adjacent to any 1s remain 0s.

2. In Example 2, the same pattern is observed. The 1s remain as 1s, and the squares directly adjacent to these 1s are changed to 2s. All other squares remain 0s.

3. Example 3 also follows the same rule. The 1s remain as 1s, and the squares directly adjacent to these 1s are changed to 2s.

From these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- Any square that is a 1 in the input grid remains a 1 in the output grid.
- Any square that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a 1 in the input grid is changed to a 2 in the output grid.
- All other squares remain 0s in the output grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Example 1:**

   - Output: The 1s are removed, leaving only the 6s in their original positions.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Contains a pattern of 2s and 3s.
   - Output: The 3s are removed, leaving only the 2s in their original positions.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- **Remove all colors except for the smallest non-zero color present in the grid.**

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- The test case contains the colors 5 and 8.
- The smallest non-zero color is 5.
- Therefore, we should remove all 8s and keep all 5s in their original positions.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. **Example 1**: The input has two non-zero values: 2 and 1. In the output, these values remain unchanged, but additional 4s and 7s appear around them. Specifically:
   - A 4 appears in the cells directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of the 2.
   - A 7 appears in the cells directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of the 1.

2. **Example 2**: The input has multiple non-zero values: 8, 2, 1, and 2. In the output:
   - The 8 remains unchanged.
   - A 4 appears around the 8.
   - A 7 appears around the 1s and 2s.
   - The 2s and 1s remain unchanged.

3. **Example 3**: The input has non-zero values: 2, 6, and 1. In the output:
   - The 2, 6, and 1 remain unchanged.
   - A 4 appears around the 2.
   - A 7 appears around the 6 and 1.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Non-zero values remain unchanged.
- A 4 is placed in the cells directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to any 2.
- A 7 is placed in the cells directly adjacent to any other non-zero value (except 2).

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a large area of zeros with a few non-zero values scattered around.
   - The output grid is smaller and contains a subset of the non-zero values from the input, arranged in a different pattern.
   - The non-zero values in the output grid seem to be a rearrangement of the non-zero values from the input grid, possibly with some values being omitted or combined.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Similar to Example 1, the input grid has a large area of zeros with a few non-zero values.
   - The output grid is smaller and contains a subset of the non-zero values from the input, again arranged differently.
   - The non-zero values in the output grid appear to be a rearrangement of the non-zero values from the input grid.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input grid has a large area of zeros with a few non-zero values.
   - The output grid is smaller and contains a subset of the non-zero values from the input, arranged differently.
   - The non-zero values in the output grid seem to be a rearrangement of the non-zero values from the input grid.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The output grid is a smaller grid that contains a subset of the non-zero values from the input grid.
- The non-zero values in the output grid are rearranged in a specific pattern, possibly based on their relative positions in the input grid.
- The output grid seems to be a compact representation of the non-zero values from the input grid, with some values being omitted or combined.

To solve the test case, we need to apply this transformation rule:
- Identify the non-zero values in the input grid.
- Rearrange these non-zero values into a smaller grid, following the pattern observed in the examples.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. In all examples, the value '2' in the input grid remains '2' in the output grid.
2. The value '0' in the input grid is transformed into '4' in the output grid if it is surrounded by '2's in a specific pattern. Specifically, a '0' becomes '4' if it is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least two '2's.
3. The transformation does not seem to affect other values, as only '0' and '2' are present in the examples.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- If a '0' is adjacent to at least two '2's, it becomes '4'.
- All other values remain unchanged.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a pattern of 1s that form a diagonal line. The output grid extends this pattern by adding rows at the bottom, continuing the diagonal line of 1s. The new rows maintain the same pattern as the original rows.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a column of 3s. The output grid extends this pattern by adding rows at the bottom, continuing the column of 3s. The new rows maintain the same pattern as the original rows.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a pattern of 2s that form a checkerboard-like structure. The output grid extends this pattern by adding rows at the bottom, continuing the checkerboard-like structure. The new rows maintain the same pattern as the original rows.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- **Extend the grid by adding rows at the bottom**.
- **Each new row should continue the pattern of the original rows**.

In the test case, the input grid has a pattern of 6s that form a vertical line with alternating positions. The output grid should extend this pattern by adding rows at the bottom, continuing the vertical line of 6s with the same alternating positions.

The transformation rule appears to involve creating a pattern where the outermost layer of the grid is filled with the value 3, and the inner layers are filled with a pattern of 0s and 3s. The pattern seems to be such that the innermost layer is filled with 0s, and as you move outward, the 3s start to appear in a checkerboard-like pattern, with the outermost layer being completely filled with 3s. The pattern also seems to be symmetrical both horizontally and vertically.

To solve the test case, we need to apply this rule to a 18x18 grid. The outermost layer will be filled with 3s. The next layer inward will have a checkerboard pattern of 0s and 3s, and this pattern will continue inward until the innermost layer is filled with 0s.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. **Example 1**: The input has two blocks of '9's. The output shows that these '9's are surrounded by '3's, and the '3's are further surrounded by '1's. The '1's are placed in a way that they fill the gaps between the '3's and the rest of the grid.

2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the '9's are surrounded by '3's, and the '3's are surrounded by '1's. The '1's fill the gaps between the '3's and the rest of the grid.

3. **Example 3**: The '9's are surrounded by '3's, and the '3's are surrounded by '1's. The '1's fill the gaps between the '3's and the rest of the grid.

4. **Example 4**: The '9's are surrounded by '3's, and the '3's are surrounded by '1's. The '1's fill the gaps between the '3's and the rest of the grid.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- '9's are surrounded by '3's.
- '3's are surrounded by '1's.
- '1's fill the gaps between the '3's and the rest of the grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has a block of '1's and a block of '2's.
   - The output shows that the '2's have expanded into the '0's that are adjacent to the '1's.
   - The '2's have not expanded into the '1's.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input has a block of '1's and a block of '2's.
   - The output shows that the '2's have expanded into the '0's that are adjacent to the '1's.
   - The '2's have not expanded into the '1's.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input has a block of '1's and a block of '2's.
   - The output shows that the '2's have expanded into the '0's that are adjacent to the '1's.
   - The '2's have not expanded into the '1's.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The '2's expand into the '0's that are adjacent to the '1's.
- The '2's do not expand into the '1's.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. **Example 1**: The input has a pattern of colors at the bottom right. The output shifts this pattern upwards and to the left, leaving the bottom part empty.
2. **Example 2**: The input has a pattern of colors in the middle and bottom right. The output shifts these patterns upwards and to the left, leaving the bottom part empty.
3. **Example 3**: The input has a pattern of colors at the bottom right. The output shifts this pattern upwards and to the left, leaving the bottom part empty.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Shift all colored patterns upwards and to the left.
- The bottom part of the grid becomes empty after the shift.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The pattern of '2's and '4's will shift upwards and to the left.
- The pattern of '1's will also shift upwards and to the left.
- The bottom part of the grid will become empty.

1. In Example 1, the input grid has values 1, 7, 8. The output grid shows that all 7s are replaced with 5s, while 1s and 8s remain unchanged.
2. In Example 2, the same pattern is observed: all 7s are replaced with 5s, and other values remain the same.
3. In Example 3, again, all 7s are replaced with 5s, and the other values (1, 8) remain unchanged.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input has a pattern of '8's and '2's. The output shows that '3's are placed in a diagonal pattern starting from the top-left corner of the grid, moving towards the bottom-right corner. The '8's and '2's remain unchanged.

2. **Example 2**: The input has '8's and '2's in a different arrangement. The output again shows '3's placed in a diagonal pattern starting from the top-left corner, moving towards the bottom-right corner. The '8's and '2's remain unchanged.

3. **Example 3**: The input has '2's and '8's in a different arrangement. The output shows '3's placed in a diagonal pattern starting from the top-left corner, moving towards the bottom-right corner. The '8's and '2's remain unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples:

1. In Example 1, the non-zero values (4, 9, 6, 1) are moved to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their relative order. The zeros remain in the top rows.
2. In Example 2, the non-zero values (4, 7, 8, 9) are moved to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their relative order. The zeros remain in the top rows.
3. In Example 3, the non-zero values (3, 1, 2, 6) are moved to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their relative order. The zeros remain in the top rows.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- All non-zero values are moved to the bottom of the grid, maintaining their relative order.
- The zeros are moved to the top of the grid, maintaining their relative order.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

[0, 0, 6, 0, 0],
[5, 2, 0, 4, 0],
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Applying the transformation rule:
- Non-zero values: 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 5, 2, 4, 5
- Zeros: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The output should be:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[2, 2, 3, 4, 4],
[5, 5, 5, 6, 0]

However, since the output grid should have the same dimensions as the input grid, we need to fit the non-zero values into the bottom rows while maintaining their relative order.

2. The other values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are transformed into new values (6, 7, 8, 9) respectively.

   - 1 -> 7
   - 2 -> 8
   - 3 -> 9
   - 4 -> 10

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a few non-zero values (8 and 2) scattered across the grid. In the output, these values are mirrored horizontally and vertically. Specifically, the value 8 appears in a mirrored pattern across the grid, and the value 2 remains in its original position but is mirrored horizontally and vertically.

2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the non-zero values (8 and 2) are mirrored horizontally and vertically in the output. The value 8 is mirrored across the grid, and the value 2 is mirrored horizontally and vertically.

3. **Example 3**: The non-zero values (8 and 2) are mirrored horizontally and vertically. The value 8 is mirrored across the grid, and the value 2 remains in its original position but is mirrored horizontally and vertically.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Non-zero values are mirrored horizontally and vertically across the grid.
- The original positions of the non-zero values are preserved, and their mirrored counterparts are placed symmetrically.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- The value 8 appears in the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 11th rows at the last column. These values will be mirrored horizontally and vertically.
- The value 2 appears in the 12th row at the 3rd, 7th, and 12th columns. These values will be mirrored horizontally and vertically.

4. In Example 4, the output grid has the value 6 in the bottom-right section where there are three consecutive zeros in the input grid.

From these observations, it appears that the transformation rule is to replace sequences of consecutive zeros with the value 6. The number of consecutive zeros that trigger this transformation varies, but it seems that any sequence of three or more consecutive zeros is replaced with 6.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a large number of 8s and 0s, with a few other numbers scattered. The output grid is significantly smaller and contains only the non-zero values from the input grid, arranged in a smaller grid. The non-zero values are shifted to the center of the output grid, and the surrounding 8s and 0s are removed.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a large number of 6s and 1s, with a few other numbers scattered. The output grid is smaller and contains only the non-zero values from the input grid, arranged in a smaller grid. The non-zero values are shifted to the center of the output grid, and the surrounding 6s are removed.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a large number of 4s and 8s, with a few other numbers scattered. The output grid is smaller and contains only the non-zero values from the input grid, arranged in a smaller grid. The non-zero values are shifted to the center of the output grid, and the surrounding 4s and 8s are removed.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Remove all the surrounding values that are the same as the majority value in the input grid (e.g., 8s, 6s, 4s).
- Shift the remaining non-zero values to the center of a smaller grid.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The majority value in the first part of the test case is 4, so we remove all 4s.
- The majority value in the second part of the test case is 2, so we remove all 2s.
- The remaining non-zero values are shifted to the center of a smaller grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a pattern of 0s and 9s, and the output grid shows 2s where the 0s are in the top-left 3x3 section of the input grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with 0s.
2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a similar pattern, and the output grid again shows 2s where the 0s are in the top-left 3x3 section of the input grid.
3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a mix of 0s, 9s, and 1s. The output grid shows 2s where the 0s are in the top-left 3x3 section of the input grid.
4. **Example 4**: The input grid has a mix of 0s, 9s, and 1s. The output grid shows 2s where the 0s are in the top-left 3x3 section of the input grid.
5. **Example 5**: The input grid has a mix of 0s, 9s, and 1s. The output grid shows 2s where the 0s are in the top-left 3x3 section of the input grid.

From these examples, it appears that the transformation rule is:
- The output grid is a 3x3 grid.
- The output grid contains 2s where the corresponding positions in the top-left 3x3 section of the input grid contain 0s.
- All other positions in the output grid are filled with 0s.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

Test Case Input:

[0, 0, 9],
[9, 0, 9],
[0, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 0],
[1, 0, 0]
]
```

Applying the transformation rule:
- The top-left 3x3 section of the input grid is:
```
[
[9, 0, 9],
[0, 0, 9],
[9, 0, 9]
]
```
- The positions of 0s in this section are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), and (2,1).
- Therefore, the output grid will have 2s at these positions and 0s elsewhere.

Output:
```

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Example 1**: 
   - The input contains zeros in certain positions, but the output does not have any zeros. Instead, the zeros are replaced by the surrounding non-zero values.
   - The surrounding values seem to be chosen based on the nearest non-zero value in the immediate vicinity.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Similar to Example 1, zeros in the input are replaced by the nearest non-zero value in the output.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Again, zeros are replaced by the nearest non-zero value.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- **Zero values in the input grid are replaced by the nearest non-zero value from the surrounding cells in the output grid.**

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To solve the test case, we will replace each zero in the input grid with the nearest non-zero value from its surrounding cells.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the examples provided:

1. **Example 1**: 
   - The input and output grids are almost identical, except for a few cells in the 7th row and 17th, 18th, and 19th columns. These cells are changed from 0 to 1.
   - This suggests that the transformation rule might involve changing specific cells under certain conditions.

2. **Example 2**: 
   - Similar to Example 1, the input and output grids are mostly the same, with a few cells changed from 0 to 1. These changes occur in the 7th row and 4th, 5th, and 6th columns.
   - This reinforces the idea that the transformation rule involves changing specific cells from 0 to 1 under certain conditions.

3. **Example 3**: 
   - Again, the input and output grids are mostly the same, with a few cells changed from 0 to 1. These changes occur in the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th rows and 14th, 15th, and 16th columns.
   - This further supports the idea that the transformation rule involves changing specific cells from 0 to 1 under certain conditions.

From these observations, it appears that the transformation rule involves changing cells from 0 to 1 if they are surrounded by a specific pattern of non-zero values. Specifically, the cells that are changed to 1 seem to be in areas where there are multiple adjacent non-zero values.

To solve the test case, we need to apply this rule to the test input grid. We will look for cells that are 0 and are surrounded by a specific pattern of non-zero values and change them to 1.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has a row of two '2's at the fourth row.
   - The output shows that the '2's remain unchanged, but the rows above and below are filled with '3's and '1's respectively, in a decreasing pattern towards the edges.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input has a row of three '2's at the fourth row.
   - The output shows a similar pattern: '2's remain unchanged, '3's fill the rows above in a decreasing pattern, and '1's fill the rows below in a decreasing pattern.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input has a row of four '2's at the third row.
   - The output again shows the same pattern: '2's remain unchanged, '3's fill the rows above, and '1's fill the rows below.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The '2's remain in their original positions.
- The rows above the '2's are filled with '3's in a decreasing pattern towards the edges.
- The rows below the '2's are filled with '1's in a decreasing pattern towards the edges.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:
- The test case has a row of five '2's at the third row.
- The rows above should be filled with '3's in a decreasing pattern.
- The rows below should be filled with '1's in a decreasing pattern.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has multiple clusters of numbers (3s, 4s, 8s, etc.), but the output grid only contains the number 4. The 4s in the output grid correspond to the largest cluster of 4s in the input grid. The output grid is a 3x3 grid centered on the largest cluster of 4s.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has multiple clusters of numbers (2s, 3s, 8s, etc.), but the output grid only contains the number 3. The 3s in the output grid correspond to the largest cluster of 3s in the input grid. The output grid is a 3x3 grid centered on the largest cluster of 3s.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has multiple clusters of numbers (2s, 3s, 8s, etc.), but the output grid only contains the number 2. The 2s in the output grid correspond to the largest cluster of 2s in the input grid. The output grid is a 3x3 grid centered on the largest cluster of 2s.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify the largest cluster of the same number in the input grid.
- Create a 3x3 output grid centered on this largest cluster.
- Fill the 3x3 grid with the number that forms the largest cluster.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

The test case input grid has multiple clusters of numbers (1s, 2s, 3s, 7s, 8s). The largest cluster is the 2s, which form a 3x3 cluster.

The 3x3 output grid centered on this largest cluster of 2s will be:

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids in the examples provided:

1. **Observation of Changes**:
   - In all examples, the value '4' is being replaced by '6' in certain positions.
   - The positions where '4' is replaced by '6' seem to follow a pattern.

2. **Pattern Identification**:
   - In each row, the '4's that are replaced by '6's are in positions that are multiples of 3 (considering 0-based indexing).
   - For example, in the first row of Example 1, the '4's at positions 0, 3, 6, and 9 are replaced by '6's.
   - This pattern holds true for all the examples provided.

3. **Rule Formulation**:
   - The transformation rule can be summarized as: Replace the value '4' with '6' at every position that is a multiple of 3 in each row.

4. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**:
   - We will apply the same rule to the test case. We will replace '4' with '6' at every position that is a multiple of 3 in each row.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has a row of 4s at the top, and the output grid has a row of 5s at the top. The rest of the grid is filled with 0s.
2. In Example 2, the input grid has a row of 6s in the middle, and the output grid has a row of 5s in the middle. The rest of the grid is filled with 0s.
3. In Example 3, the input grid has a row of 4s in the middle and a row of 9s at the bottom. The output grid has rows of 5s in the middle and at the bottom. The rest of the grid is filled with 0s.
4. In Example 4, the input grid has a row of 1s at the bottom, and the output grid has a row of 5s at the bottom. The rest of the grid is filled with 0s.

From these examples, it appears that the transformation rule is as follows:
- If a row in the input grid contains the same number repeated three times, that row in the output grid will be filled with 5s.
- All other rows in the output grid will be filled with 0s.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:
- The first row of the test case is [4, 4, 4], which contains the same number repeated three times. Therefore, the first row of the output grid will be [5, 5, 5].
- The second row of the test case is [3, 2, 3], which does not contain the same number repeated three times. Therefore, the second row of the output grid will be [0, 0, 0].
- The third row of the test case is [8, 8, 8], which contains the same number repeated three times. Therefore, the third row of the output grid will be [5, 5, 5].

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In each example, the transformation seems to focus on the inner squares of the colored regions.
2. The inner squares of each colored region are replaced with the value 8.
3. The outermost layer of each colored region remains unchanged.

Let's break down the examples:

- **Example 1**: The inner squares of the '2' and '3' regions are replaced with '8', while the outermost layer remains '2' and '3'.
- **Example 2**: The inner squares of the '2' and '1' regions are replaced with '8', while the outermost layer remains '2' and '1'.
- **Example 3**: The inner squares of the '2', '3', and '1' regions are replaced with '8', while the outermost layer remains '2', '3', and '1'.

From these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- For each colored region (excluding the background '0'), the inner squares (excluding the outermost layer) are replaced with '8'.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a central square with the number 8 and other numbers (4, 3, 2, 6) inside it. In the output, these numbers (4, 3, 2, 6) are moved to the top and bottom rows, while the central 8s remain unchanged. The numbers 4, 3, 2, and 6 are placed in the top and bottom rows in a specific order.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a central square with the number 7 and other numbers (2, 8, 9, 3) inside it. In the output, these numbers (2, 8, 9, 3) are moved to the top and bottom rows, while the central 7s remain unchanged. The numbers 2, 8, 9, and 3 are placed in the top and bottom rows in a specific order.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a central square with the number 1 and other numbers (2, 5, 6, 3) inside it. In the output, these numbers (2, 5, 6, 3) are moved to the top and bottom rows, while the central 1s remain unchanged. The numbers 2, 5, 6, and 3 are placed in the top and bottom rows in a specific order.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The central square (with the same number) remains unchanged.
- The other numbers inside the central square are moved to the top and bottom rows.
- The numbers are placed in the top and bottom rows in a specific order: the first number goes to the top row, the second number goes to the bottom row, the third number goes to the top row, and the fourth number goes to the bottom row.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The central square has the number 3.
- The other numbers inside the central square are 6, 4, 8, and 2.
- These numbers will be placed in the top and bottom rows in the order: 6 (top), 4 (bottom), 8 (top), 2 (bottom).

2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid. The original 3x3 grid is repeated three times horizontally and three times vertically, with zeros filling the gaps between the repetitions.

3. **Example 3**: The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid. The original 3x3 grid is repeated three times horizontally and three times vertically, with zeros filling the gaps between the repetitions.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input has a single '2' at position (4, 4). The output shows a pattern where '2' is placed in a diamond shape around the original position. The diamond extends outward in all four directions (up, down, left, right) and diagonally, with the original '2' at the center.

2. **Example 2**: The input has a single '7' at position (6, 12). The output shows a similar diamond pattern around the '7', extending outward in all directions.

3. **Example 3**: The input has a single '8' at position (4, 3). The output again shows a diamond pattern around the '8', extending outward in all directions.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify the position of the non-zero value in the input grid.
- Create a diamond pattern around this position, with the non-zero value placed at the center and extending outward in all directions.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:
- The test case has a single '6' at position (8, 13).
- We need to create a diamond pattern around this '6', extending outward in all directions.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has a pattern of 2s on the diagonal. The output grid is the same except for the center element, which is changed from 2 to 4.
2. In Example 2, the input grid has a pattern of 9s in a specific arrangement. The output grid is the same except for certain elements that are changed from 9 to 4. These elements are not on the diagonal but are in positions where there are 9s in the input.
3. In Example 3, the input grid has a pattern of 3s in a specific arrangement. The output grid is the same except for certain elements that are changed from 3 to 4. These elements are not on the diagonal but are in positions where there are 3s in the input.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- If an element in the input grid is not on the diagonal and is a non-zero value, it is changed to 4 in the output grid.
- All other elements remain unchanged.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has two blocks of color 1 and 2.
   - The output shows that for each block, a diagonal of 1s is added starting from the top-left corner of the block and extending downwards to the right.
   - The diagonal of 1s is added in such a way that it does not overlap with the existing block.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input has two blocks of color 2 and 1.
   - The output shows a similar pattern where a diagonal of 1s is added starting from the top-left corner of each block and extending downwards to the right.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input has two blocks of color 2 and 1.
   - The output again shows the same pattern of adding a diagonal of 1s starting from the top-left corner of each block.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- For each block of a specific color, add a diagonal of 1s starting from the top-left corner of the block and extending downwards to the right.
- The diagonal of 1s should not overlap with the existing block.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input is a 3x3 grid with values [0, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 7]. The output is a 9x9 grid. Each value in the input grid is repeated in a 3x3 block in the output grid. For example, the top-left '0' in the input becomes a 3x3 block of '0's in the top-left corner of the output.

2. **Example 2**: The input is a 3x3 grid with values [4, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0]. The output is a 9x9 grid. Each value in the input grid is repeated in a 3x3 block in the output grid. For example, the top-left '4' in the input becomes a 3x3 block of '4's in the top-left corner of the output.

3. **Example 3**: The input is a 3x3 grid with values [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2]. The output is a 9x9 grid. Each value in the input grid is repeated in a 3x3 block in the output grid. For example, the bottom-right '2' in the input becomes a 3x3 block of '2's in the bottom-right corner of the output.

4. **Example 4**: The input is a 3x3 grid with values [6, 6, 0], [6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6]. The output is a 9x9 grid. Each value in the input grid is repeated in a 3x3 block in the output grid. For example, the top-left '6' in the input becomes a 3x3 block of '6's in the top-left corner of the output.

5. **Example 5**: The input is a 3x3 grid with values [2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2]. The output is a 9x9 grid. Each value in the input grid is repeated in a 3x3 block in the output grid. For example, the top-left '2' in the input becomes a 3x3 block of '2's in the top-left corner of the output.

From these examples, the transformation rule is clear: each value in the input grid is repeated in a 3x3 block in the output grid. The output grid is a 9x9 grid where each 3x3 block corresponds to a single value in the input grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test case input:
[
[7, 0, 7],
[7, 0, 7],
[7, 7, 0]

The output should be a 9x9 grid where each value in the input is repeated in a 3x3 block.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a 4x4 square of '4's surrounded by zeros. The output grid is a 6x6 square of '4's, with the original 4x4 square centered within it. The zeros around the original square are replaced by '4's, and the outermost layer of zeros is removed.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a cross shape of '4's. The output grid is a 6x6 grid where the '4's form a larger cross, and the zeros around the original cross are replaced by '4's, with the outermost layer of zeros removed.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a vertical line of '4's. The output grid is a 8x6 grid where the '4's form a larger vertical line, and the zeros around the original line are replaced by '4's, with the outermost layer of zeros removed.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The output grid is formed by expanding the non-zero region of the input grid.
- The zeros surrounding the non-zero region are replaced by the non-zero value (in this case, '4').
- The outermost layer of zeros is removed.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The test case has a cross shape of '4's.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has dimensions 3x3, and the output grid has dimensions 5x3. The output grid seems to be a stretched version of the input grid, with the first column of the input grid repeated in the first column of the output grid. The second column of the input grid is repeated in the second column of the output grid, and so on. The values in the output grid are the same as the input grid, but the grid is extended with zeros.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has dimensions 3x4, and the output grid has dimensions 6x4. The same pattern is observed: the first column of the input grid is repeated in the first column of the output grid, and so on. The grid is extended with zeros.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has dimensions 4x3, and the output grid has dimensions 5x4. The pattern is consistent: the first column of the input grid is repeated in the first column of the output grid, and so on. The grid is extended with zeros.

4. **Example 4**: The input grid has dimensions 4x3, and the output grid has dimensions 6x3. The pattern is consistent: the first column of the input grid is repeated in the first column of the output grid, and so on. The grid is extended with zeros.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The output grid has the same number of columns as the input grid.
- The output grid has a number of rows that is 2 more than the number of rows in the input grid.
- The values in the output grid are the same as the input grid, but the grid is extended with zeros.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a pattern of 3s and 9s. The output grid is the same except for the bottom two rows, where a 3 appears in the last two columns. This suggests that the transformation rule might involve adding a specific color to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a pattern of 8s and 6s. The output grid is the same except for the bottom-left corner, where a 6 appears in the last two rows. This reinforces the idea that the transformation rule involves adding a specific color to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a pattern of 4s and 2s. The output grid is the same except for the bottom-left corner, where a 2 appears in the last two rows. This further supports the idea that the transformation rule involves adding a specific color to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

4. **Example 4**: The input grid has a pattern of 5s and 4s. The output grid is the same except for the bottom-left corner, where a 4 appears in the last five rows. This suggests that the transformation rule involves adding a specific color to the bottom-right corner of the grid, and the number of rows affected depends on the pattern of the input grid.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify the bottom-right corner of the grid.
- Add the color of the bottom-right corner of the input grid to the bottom-right corner of the output grid.
- The number of rows affected depends on the pattern of the input grid.

- Add the color 0 to the bottom-right corner of the output grid.
- The number of rows affected is 5 (based on the pattern of the input grid).

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: A 3x3 grid.
   - Output: A 9x9 grid.
   - Each value in the input grid is repeated 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: A 3x3 grid.
   - Output: A 9x9 grid.
   - Each value in the input grid is also repeated 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically.

From these examples, it is clear that the transformation rule is to scale the input grid by a factor of 3 in both dimensions. Each cell in the input grid is replaced by a 3x3 block of the same value.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples.

1. **Observation of Example 1:**
   - In the input, there are clusters of '1's. In the output, these clusters are replaced with '2's.
   - Single '1's that are not part of a cluster remain as '1's in the output.
   - The rest of the grid remains '0's.

2. **Observation of Example 2:**
   - Similar to Example 1, clusters of '1's are replaced with '2's in the output.
   - Single '1's that are not part of a cluster remain as '1's in the output.
   - The rest of the grid remains '0's.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Replace clusters of '1's with '2's.
- Leave single '1's as '1's.
- All other values remain '0's.

A cluster is defined as a group of '1's that are adjacent either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has multiple colors (6, 3, 1, 2, 7, 4, 8), but the output is a single value `[6]`. This suggests that the output is determined by a specific characteristic of the input grid.
2. **Example 2**: The input grid has multiple colors (8, 5, 2, 7, 4), and the output is `[5]`. This indicates that the output is not simply the most frequent color or the first color encountered.
3. **Example 3**: The input grid has multiple colors (1, 3, 2, 7), and the output is `[2]`. This further supports the idea that the output is based on a specific rule rather than frequency or position.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the output is the color that is surrounded by the most other colors. In other words, the color that has the highest number of adjacent colors (including diagonals) is selected as the output.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- The test case grid has multiple colors (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8).
- We need to count the number of adjacent colors for each color:
  - Color `2` is adjacent to `3`, `4`, `5`, `8`.
  - Color `3` is adjacent to `2`, `4`, `7`.
  - Color `4` is adjacent to `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `8`.
  - Color `5` is adjacent to `2`, `4`, `8`.
  - Color `7` is adjacent to `3`, `4`, `8`.
  - Color `8` is adjacent to `2`, `4`, `5`, `7`.

Color `4` has the highest number of adjacent colors (5), so the output should be `[4]`.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the provided examples:

1. **Observation of Changes**: 
   - In Example 1, the value '2' in the input grid is replaced by '4' in the output grid in certain positions.
   - In Example 2, the value '2' in the input grid is also replaced by '4' in the output grid in certain positions.
   - In Example 3, the value '2' in the input grid is replaced by '4' in the output grid in certain positions.

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The transformation seems to be related to the value '2'. Whenever '2' is surrounded by a specific pattern of values, it is replaced by '4'.
   - Specifically, '2' is replaced by '4' when it is surrounded by '2's or '9's in a specific pattern.

3. **Rule Formulation**:
   - The rule appears to be: If a '2' is surrounded by '2's or '9's in a specific pattern (like a cluster), it is replaced by '4'.

4. **Applying the Rule**:
   - We need to check each '2' in the test case and see if it is surrounded by '2's or '9's in a specific pattern. If so, replace it with '4'.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input has two non-zero values (1 and 2) at the top-left and top-right corners. The output shows these values (1 and 2) repeated in a checkerboard pattern, with the values filling in the rows and columns around them. The pattern seems to be that the non-zero values propagate in a checkerboard fashion, filling the grid.

2. **Example 2**: The input has a non-zero value (3) at the top-right and another non-zero value (8) at the bottom-left. The output shows these values (3 and 8) repeated in a checkerboard pattern, with the values filling in the rows and columns around them. The checkerboard pattern is consistent with the values propagating outward.

3. **Example 3**: The input has a non-zero value (2) at the top-left and another non-zero value (4) at the bottom-left. The output shows these values (2 and 4) repeated in a checkerboard pattern, with the values filling in the rows and columns around them. The checkerboard pattern is consistent with the values propagating outward.

4. **Example 4**: The input has non-zero values (1 and 2) at the top-left and top-right, and another non-zero value (8) at the bottom-left. The output shows these values (1, 2, and 8) repeated in a checkerboard pattern, with the values filling in the rows and columns around them. The checkerboard pattern is consistent with the values propagating outward.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Non-zero values propagate in a checkerboard pattern, filling the grid in a way that alternates between the non-zero values and zeros.
- The propagation starts from the non-zero values and fills the grid in a checkerboard fashion.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

Applying the checkerboard pattern propagation rule:
- The value 4 at the top-left corner will propagate in a checkerboard pattern.
- The value 8 at the bottom-left corner will propagate in a checkerboard pattern.
- The value 1 at the bottom-right corner will propagate in a checkerboard pattern.

The output will be:

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has a 9 at [0, 4] and an 8 block starting at [3, 4].
   - The output shows that the 9 at [0, 4] remains unchanged.
   - The 8 block starting at [3, 4] has a 9 added at [3, 4] and a 6 added at [6, 4].
   - The 4 at [9, 5] remains unchanged.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input has a 7 at [0, 4] and an 8 block starting at [3, 3].
   - The output shows that the 7 at [0, 4] remains unchanged.
   - The 8 block starting at [3, 3] has a 6 added at [3, 0], a 7 added at [3, 1], and a 2 added at [5, 9].
   - The 2 at [5, 9] and 1 at [9, 5] remain unchanged.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input has a 4 at [0, 3] and an 8 block starting at [3, 3].
   - The output shows that the 4 at [0, 3] remains unchanged.
   - The 8 block starting at [3, 3] has a 4 added at [3, 0], a 6 added at [3, 9], a 3 added at [4, 0], a 2 added at [6, 0], and a 7 added at [7, 3].
   - The 6 at [3, 9] and 2 at [7, 9] remain unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each block of the same number (e.g., 8s), the first occurrence of that number in the block is replaced by the number directly above it in the same column, if that number is not zero. If the number above is zero, it remains unchanged.
- The rest of the numbers in the block remain the same.
- Numbers outside the block remain unchanged.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The 6 at [0, 3] and 2 at [0, 5] remain unchanged.
- The 8 block starting at [3, 2] has a 9 added at [3, 2] (from the 9 above it), a 3 added at [5, 0] (from the 3 above it), a 4 added at [6, 0] (from the 4 above it), and a 6 added at [9, 3] (from the 6 above it).
- The 7 at [4, 9] remains unchanged.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid is a 9x9 matrix, and the output is a 3x3 matrix. The output matrix seems to be a condensed version of the input grid. Observing the output, it appears that the output matrix is formed by taking the central 3x3 section of the input grid. This is supported by the fact that the central 3x3 section of the input grid in Example 1 is:
   ```
   [8, 8, 8],
   [0, 1, 1],
   [8, 8, 8]
   ```
   However, the output is:
   ```
   [8, 1, 8],
   [1, 8, 1],
   [1, 8, 1]
   ```
   This suggests that the transformation rule might involve some form of averaging or majority voting of the values in the central 3x3 section.

2. **Example 2**: The central 3x3 section of the input grid is:
   ```
   [8, 8, 8],
   [0, 1, 8],
   [8, 8, 8]
   ```
   The output is:
   ```
   [8, 1, 8],
   [1, 1, 8],
   [8, 8, 1]
   ```
   This further supports the idea of a majority voting or averaging rule.

3. **Example 3**: The central 3x3 section of the input grid is:
   ```
   [8, 8, 8],
   [0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0]
   ```
   The output is:
   ```
   [8, 1, 8],
   [1, 1, 8],
   [1, 8, 1]
   ```
   This suggests that the rule might be more complex than simple averaging.

4. **Example 4**: The central 3x3 section of the input grid is:
   ```
   [0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0],
   [8, 1, 8]
   ```
   The output is:
   ```
   [8, 1, 1],
   [1, 1, 1],
   [8, 1, 8]
   ```
   This further supports the idea of a complex rule involving majority voting or some form of pattern recognition.

Given these observations, the transformation rule appears to involve taking the central 3x3 section of the input grid and applying a majority voting rule to determine the values in the output grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

The central 3x3 section of the test case input grid is:
```
[0, 0, 0],
[8, 1, 8],
[8, 8, 1]
```
Applying the majority voting rule, the output grid should be:
```
[8, 1, 8],
[8, 1, 8],
[8, 8, 1]

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Observation of the Output Grid Size**: The output grid is consistently 4x4, regardless of the input grid size. This suggests that the transformation involves selecting a specific 4x4 section from the input grid.

2. **Observation of the Selected Section**: In all examples, the output grid appears to be a 4x4 section centered around the middle of the input grid. The middle of the input grid is the 5th row and 5th column, which is the center of the 9x9 grid.

3. **Observation of Values in the Selected Section**: The values in the output grid are directly taken from the corresponding positions in the selected 4x4 section of the input grid. There is no apparent transformation or modification of the values themselves.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- Select the 4x4 section of the input grid that is centered around the middle of the input grid (5th row and 5th column for a 9x9 grid).
- Copy the values from this 4x4 section directly to the output grid without any modification.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Input:

[0, 1, 4, 0],

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a pattern where the outermost layer is 4, the next layer is 2, then 1, 3, 5, and 8. In the output, the outermost layer becomes 8, the next layer becomes 5, then 3, 1, 2, and 4. It appears that each value is being replaced by the value that is 4 units higher in the sequence (4 -> 8, 2 -> 5, 1 -> 3, 3 -> 1, 5 -> 2, 8 -> 4).

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a pattern where the outermost layer is 2, the next layer is 1, and then 6. In the output, the outermost layer becomes 6, the next layer becomes 1, and then 2. This follows the same rule as Example 1, where each value is replaced by the value that is 4 units higher in the sequence (2 -> 6, 1 -> 1, 6 -> 2).

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a pattern where the outermost layer is 8, the next layer is 1, then 2, 4. In the output, the outermost layer becomes 4, the next layer becomes 2, then 1, 8. This follows the same rule as the previous examples (8 -> 4, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 1, 4 -> 8).

4. **Example 4**: The input grid has a pattern where the outermost layer is 7, the next layer is 2, then 4, 1, 3. In the output, the outermost layer becomes 3, the next layer becomes 1, then 4, 2, 7. This follows the same rule as the previous examples (7 -> 3, 2 -> 1, 4 -> 4, 1 -> 2, 3 -> 7).

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be that each value in the grid is replaced by the value that is 4 units higher in the sequence. If the value exceeds 10, it wraps around to the beginning of the sequence (e.g., 8 + 4 = 12, which wraps around to 2).

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In both examples, the input grid contains a single non-zero value (8) at a specific position.
2. The output grid shows a pattern of 5s surrounding the original position of the 8, forming a diamond shape.
3. The diamond shape expands outward from the original position of the 8, with the 5s forming a symmetrical pattern around it.
4. The size of the diamond appears to be consistent, with the 5s extending a certain number of steps in all directions from the original 8.

From these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- Identify the position of the non-zero value (8) in the input grid.
- Create a diamond-shaped pattern of 5s centered at this position, extending a fixed number of steps in all directions.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

The test case has an 8 at position (6, 5). We need to create a diamond-shaped pattern of 5s centered at this position.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid is a 3x3 grid with all values as 1 except the center, which is 0. The output grid has all values as 0 except the center, which is 1. This suggests that the transformation might involve swapping the values of the center and the surrounding squares.

2. In Example 2, the input grid is a 5x5 grid with all values as 2 except the center, which is 0. The output grid has all values as 0 except the center, which is 2. This reinforces the idea that the transformation involves swapping the values of the center and the surrounding squares.

3. In Example 3, the input grid is a 7x7 grid with all values as 3 except the center, which is 0. The output grid has all values as 0 except the center, which is 3. This further confirms the swapping pattern.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The value at the center of the grid (if it exists) is swapped with the value 0.
- All other values in the grid are set to 0.

   - The output grid has the same diagonal of 9s, and the 5s are replaced by 9s in a similar shifted diagonal pattern.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input grid has a diagonal of 2s and some 5s.
   - The output grid has the same diagonal of 2s, and the 5s are replaced by 2s in the same shifted diagonal pattern.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each non-zero value (let's call it `x`) on the diagonal, it is copied to the positions where the other non-zero values (let's call them `y`) are, but shifted diagonally. The value `y` is replaced by `x` in these positions.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:
- The diagonal has 1s.
- The other non-zero values are 5s.
- We need to replace the 5s with 1s in a shifted diagonal pattern.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. **Example 1**: The input has a 9 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. The output shows the 9s moving to the right and down, but the zeros remain in the top-left corner.
2. **Example 2**: The input has 6s in the top row and bottom-left, with zeros elsewhere. The output shows the 6s moving to the left and down, but the zeros remain in the top-left corner.
3. **Example 3**: The input has 9s in the bottom-right corner and zeros elsewhere. The output shows the 9s moving to the left and up, but the zeros remain in the top-left corner.
4. **Example 4**: The input has 2s scattered around with zeros. The output shows the 2s moving to the left and up, but the zeros remain in the top-left corner.

From these examples, it seems that the transformation rule involves moving non-zero values to the left and up as much as possible, while zeros remain in the top-left corner. This suggests a gravity-like effect where non-zero values ""fall"" to the left and up.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- The 5s should move to the left and up as much as possible.
- The zeros should remain in the top-left corner.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid contains various numbers, but the output grid has only two values: 0 and 3. The value 3 appears in a row that contains the number 3 in the input grid. All other rows are filled with 0s.
2. **Example 2**: The input grid contains various numbers, but the output grid has only two values: 0 and 2. The value 2 appears in rows that contain the number 2 in the input grid. All other rows are filled with 0s.
3. **Example 3**: The input grid contains various numbers, but the output grid has only two values: 0 and 8. The value 8 appears in rows that contain the number 8 in the input grid. All other rows are filled with 0s.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify the maximum value in the input grid.
- In the output grid, fill the rows that contain the maximum value from the input grid with this maximum value.
- Fill all other rows with 0s.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Observation of Example 1:**
   - In the input, there are many zeros that are replaced by 1s in the output.
   - The non-zero values remain unchanged in the output.

2. **Observation of Example 2:**
   - Similar to Example 1, zeros are replaced by 1s in the output.
   - Non-zero values remain the same.

3. **Observation of Example 3:**
   - Again, zeros are replaced by 1s in the output.
   - Non-zero values remain unchanged.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- **All zeros in the input grid are replaced by 1s in the output grid.**
- **All non-zero values in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.**

This rule consistently applies across all the training examples.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: A grid with multiple colored regions (2s, 7s, and 6s).
   - Output: A smaller grid containing only the 6s, which are the bottom-most and right-most region in the input grid.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: A grid with multiple colored regions (4s, 8s, and 2s).
   - Output: A smaller grid containing only the 4s, which are the top-left region in the input grid.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: A grid with multiple colored regions (3s, 5s, and 8s).
   - Output: A smaller grid containing only the 5s, which are the right-most region in the input grid.

From these examples, it appears that the transformation rule is to select the largest contiguous region of a single color that is either the bottom-most, right-most, or top-left region in the input grid. The output grid is then formed by cropping the input grid to only include this selected region.

Applying this rule to the test case:

- The test case has multiple colored regions: 3s, 9s, and 4s.
- The largest contiguous region is the 9s, which are the top-left region in the input grid.

Therefore, the output should be a grid containing only the 9s.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a pattern of '8's forming a shape. In the output, these '8's are replaced by '2's, and the surrounding '0's that are adjacent to '8's are replaced by '1's. The rest of the '0's remain unchanged.

2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the '8's are replaced by '2's, and the '0's adjacent to '8's are replaced by '1's. The rest of the '0's remain unchanged.

3. **Example 3**: The same pattern is observed. '8's are replaced by '2's, and the '0's adjacent to '8's are replaced by '1's. The rest of the '0's remain unchanged.

From these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- Replace all '8's with '2's.
- Replace all '0's that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to '8's with '1's.
- All other '0's remain '0's.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids in the training examples.

### Example 1:
- The input grid has a pattern of 2s and 4s in the top-left and 5s in the bottom-right.
- The output grid shows that the 5s in the bottom-right have been replaced by 2s and 4s, following the same pattern as the top-left.

### Example 2:
- The input grid has a pattern of 6s and 8s in the top-left and 5s in the bottom-right.
- The output grid shows that the 5s in the bottom-right have been replaced by 6s and 8s, following the same pattern as the top-left.

### General Rule:
The transformation rule appears to be that the pattern of numbers in the top-left section of the grid is mirrored or copied into the bottom-right section of the grid. Specifically, the pattern of numbers in the top-left corner is used to replace the numbers in the bottom-right corner, maintaining the same relative positions.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Case:
- The top-left section of the test case has a pattern of 4s, 1s, and 5s.
- We need to mirror this pattern into the bottom-right section of the grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid is a 24x24 grid, and the output grid is a 5x5 grid. The output grid seems to be a smaller, simplified version of the input grid. The transformation appears to involve selecting a specific region of the input grid and reducing it to a smaller grid.

2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the input grid is 24x24, and the output grid is 5x5. The output grid again appears to be a simplified version of a specific region of the input grid.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid is 24x24, and the output grid is 5x5. The output grid is a simplified version of a specific region of the input grid.

From these examples, it seems the transformation rule involves:
- Selecting a specific 5x5 region from the input grid.
- Simplifying this region to a 5x5 output grid.

The specific region selected appears to be the central 5x5 region of the input grid. This is consistent across all examples.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

The test case input grid is a 24x24 grid. We need to select the central 5x5 region and simplify it to a 5x5 output grid.

The central 5x5 region of the test case input grid is:

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids in the training examples.

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a cluster of 4s in the top-left and bottom-right sections.
   - In the output, the 4s remain unchanged, but new 7s appear in positions adjacent to the 4s. Specifically, 7s appear in positions that are diagonally adjacent to the 4s.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid has a cluster of 4s in the top-left and bottom-right sections.
   - In the output, the 4s remain unchanged, and 7s appear in positions that are diagonally adjacent to the 4s.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each 4 in the input grid, if there is a 0 diagonally adjacent to it, that 0 is changed to a 7 in the output grid.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.
</reasoning>

Test Case Input:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
]
```

Applying the transformation rule:
- For the 4 at (1, 4), the diagonally adjacent 0s at (0, 3) and (2, 3) become 7s.
- For the 4s at (2, 2) and (2, 3), the diagonally adjacent 0s at (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 3) become 7s.
- For the 4 at (3, 2), the diagonally adjacent 0s at (2, 1) and (4, 1) become 7s.
- For the 4 at (6, 5), the diagonally adjacent 0s at (5, 4) and (7, 4) become 7s.
- For the 4s at (7, 5), (7, 6), and (7, 7), the diagonally adjacent 0s at (6, 4), (6, 6), (6, 7), (8, 4), (8, 6), and (8, 7) become 7s.
- For the 4 at (8, 6), the diagonally adjacent 0s at (7, 5) and (9, 5) become 7s.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid is a 3x3 matrix. The output grid is a 6x6 matrix. The transformation seems to mirror the input grid both horizontally and vertically, creating a symmetrical pattern. The center of the output grid is the same as the center of the input grid, and the values are mirrored around this center.

2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the input grid is a 3x3 matrix, and the output grid is a 6x6 matrix. The values are mirrored both horizontally and vertically around the center of the input grid.

3. **Example 3**: The same pattern is observed. The input grid is a 3x3 matrix, and the output grid is a 6x6 matrix. The values are mirrored both horizontally and vertically around the center of the input grid.

4. **Example 4**: The pattern is consistent. The input grid is a 3x3 matrix, and the output grid is a 6x6 matrix. The values are mirrored both horizontally and vertically around the center of the input grid.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The input grid is mirrored both horizontally and vertically to create a larger grid that is twice the size of the original grid in both dimensions.
- The center of the output grid is the same as the center of the input grid, and the values are mirrored around this center.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case Input:
[

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a few non-8 values (0 and 2) scattered around. In the output, these values remain unchanged, but additional 2s appear in a diagonal pattern starting from the bottom-right corner of the grid. This suggests that the transformation rule involves adding a diagonal pattern of the non-8 values starting from the bottom-right corner.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a few non-1 values (0 and 3) scattered around. In the output, these values remain unchanged, but additional 3s appear in a diagonal pattern starting from the bottom-right corner of the grid. This further supports the idea that the transformation rule involves adding a diagonal pattern of the non-1 values starting from the bottom-right corner.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a few non-4 values (0 and 8) scattered around. In the output, these values remain unchanged, but additional 8s appear in a diagonal pattern starting from the bottom-right corner of the grid. This confirms the pattern observed in the previous examples.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify all non-background values (values other than the most common value in the grid).
- For each non-background value, add a diagonal pattern of that value starting from the bottom-right corner of the grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.
</reasoning>

The test case input grid has a few non-3 values (0 and 6) scattered around. The most common value is 3, so the non-background values are 0 and 6. We will add diagonal patterns of 0 and 6 starting from the bottom-right corner of the grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Observation of the Input and Output Grids:**
   - The input grid has 13 rows and 5 columns.
   - The output grid has 6 rows and 5 columns.
   - The transformation seems to reduce the number of rows from 13 to 6.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The output grid appears to be a condensed version of the input grid.
   - The transformation rule seems to involve grouping the rows of the input grid into pairs and applying a specific logic to determine the output value for each cell.

3. **Logic for Transformation:**
   - For each cell in the output grid, the value is determined by the corresponding cells in the input grid.
   - If a cell in the input grid has a value of 2, it is transformed to 3 in the output grid.
   - If a cell in the input grid has a value of 0, it remains 0 in the output grid.
   - The transformation seems to ignore the row with all 4s in the input grid.

4. **Grouping and Transformation:**
   - The rows in the input grid are grouped into pairs, and the transformation is applied to each pair.
   - The row with all 4s is ignored, and the transformation is applied to the remaining rows.

5. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - The test case input grid has 13 rows and 5 columns.
   - The output grid should have 6 rows and 5 columns.
   - The transformation rule should be applied to the test case input grid to determine the output grid.

Based on the above reasoning, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- Group the rows of the input grid into pairs.
- Apply the transformation logic to each pair to determine the output value for each cell.
- Ignore the row with all 4s in the input grid.

2. **Example 2**: The input has a single '0' in the 4th row and 3rd column. In the output, this '0' is replaced by '0's in the same row and column, extending vertically and horizontally from the original '0'.
3. **Example 3**: The input has two '0's, one in the 3rd row and 4th column, and another in the 4th row and 12th column. In the output, these '0's are replaced by '0's in the same rows and columns, extending vertically and horizontally from the original '0's.
4. **Example 4**: The input has three '0's, one in the 3rd row and 13th column, another in the 7th row and 7th column, and the last in the 13th row and 11th column. In the output, these '0's are replaced by '0's in the same rows and columns, extending vertically and horizontally from the original '0's.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has a pattern of '2's and '0's. The output grid shows that the '0's that are surrounded by '2's on all sides are replaced with '9's. This suggests that the rule involves identifying '0's that are completely surrounded by a specific color (in this case, '2') and replacing them with '9'.

2. In Example 2, the same pattern is observed. The '0's that are completely surrounded by '2's are replaced with '9's. This reinforces the idea that the rule involves identifying '0's surrounded by a specific color and replacing them with '9'.

3. In Example 3, the pattern is consistent. The '0's that are completely surrounded by '2's are replaced with '9's. This further confirms the rule.

From these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
- Identify all '0's that are completely surrounded by a specific color (in this case, '2').
- Replace these '0's with '9'.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: The grid has values 0, 1, and 4 in the first four rows, and values 0, 2 in the last four rows.
   - Output: The output grid has values 0 and 3. The value 3 appears in the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid, corresponding to the bottom-right quadrant of the input grid where the value 1 is present.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: The grid has values 1, 0, and 4 in the first four rows, and values 0, 2 in the last four rows.
   - Output: The output grid has values 0 and 3. The value 3 appears in the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid, corresponding to the bottom-right quadrant of the input grid where the value 1 is present.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: The grid has values 0, 1, and 4 in the first four rows, and values 0, 2 in the last four rows.
   - Output: The output grid has values 0 and 3. The value 3 appears in the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid, corresponding to the bottom-right quadrant of the input grid where the value 1 is present.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: The grid has values 1, 0, and 4 in the first four rows, and values 0, 2 in the last four rows.
   - Output: The output grid has values 0 and 3. The value 3 appears in the bottom-right quadrant of the output grid, corresponding to the bottom-right quadrant of the input grid where the value 1 is present.

From these examples, it appears that the transformation rule is as follows:
- The output grid is a 4x4 grid.
- The value 3 appears in the output grid where the value 1 is present in the corresponding quadrant of the input grid.
- The value 0 appears in the output grid where the value 0 is present in the corresponding quadrant of the input grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case:

Test Case:
[
[1, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 1, 1, 1],
[0, 0, 1, 0],
[1, 0, 1, 1],

[2, 2, 0, 2],
[0, 0, 2, 0],
[2, 0, 0, 2],
[0, 2, 0, 2]
]

- The value 1 is present in the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants of the first four rows.
- The value 0 is present in the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants of the first four rows.

Applying the rule:
- The output grid will have the value 3 where the value 1 is present in the corresponding quadrant of the input grid.
- The output grid will have the value 0 where the value 0 is present in the corresponding quadrant of the input grid.

Therefore, the output grid will be:

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid is a 5x7 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The output grid seems to be a central 3x3 section of the input grid, but only the non-zero values are retained. The zeros in the output grid are placed where the corresponding values in the input grid are zero.

2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the output grid is a 3x3 section of the input grid, retaining the non-zero values and placing zeros where the input values are zero.

3. **Example 3**: The same pattern is observed. The output grid is a 3x3 section of the input grid, retaining the non-zero values and placing zeros where the input values are zero.

4. **Example 4**: The same pattern is observed. The output grid is a 3x3 section of the input grid, retaining the non-zero values and placing zeros where the input values are zero.

5. **Example 5**: The same pattern is observed. The output grid is a 3x3 section of the input grid, retaining the non-zero values and placing zeros where the input values are zero.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The output grid is a 3x3 section of the input grid, centered in the middle of the input grid.
- The values in the output grid are the same as the corresponding values in the input grid, but zeros are placed where the input values are zero.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a few '1's scattered across the grid.
   - The output grid shows that each '1' in the input is replaced by a '1' in the output, but it is surrounded by a pattern of '2', '6', '7', and '8'.
   - The pattern appears to be a cross shape with '1' at the center, '2' and '8' on the horizontal arms, and '6' and '7' on the vertical arms.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Similar to Example 1, each '1' in the input is replaced by a '1' in the output, surrounded by the same cross pattern of '2', '6', '7', and '8'.

From these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- Each '1' in the input grid is replaced by a '1' in the output grid.
- The '1' is surrounded by a cross pattern: '2' and '8' on the horizontal arms, and '6' and '7' on the vertical arms.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has three non-zero values: 2, 3, and 1. In the output, each non-zero value in the input grid is replaced by a row filled with that value. The row filled with the value appears in the output grid at the same row index as the original non-zero value in the input grid. The rest of the rows in the output grid are filled with the value 2.

2. In Example 2, the input grid has four non-zero values: 3, 3, 1, and 2. The output grid has rows filled with these values at the same row indices as the original non-zero values in the input grid. The rest of the rows in the output grid are filled with the value 2.

3. In Example 3, the input grid has four non-zero values: 1, 3, 2, and 2. The output grid has rows filled with these values at the same row indices as the original non-zero values in the input grid. The rest of the rows in the output grid are filled with the value 2.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each non-zero value in the input grid, the corresponding row in the output grid is filled with that value.
- All other rows in the output grid are filled with the value 2.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has two clusters of '5's and one cluster of '2's.
   - In the output, the '5's are moved closer to the center of the grid, while the '2's remain in the same position.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input has a cluster of '2's and a cluster of '5's.
   - In the output, the '5's are moved closer to the center of the grid, while the '2's remain in the same position.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input has a cluster of '2's and a cluster of '5's.
   - In the output, the '5's are moved closer to the center of the grid, while the '2's remain in the same position.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- All '5's are moved closer to the center of the grid.
- All other numbers remain in their original positions.

To apply this rule to the test case:
- Identify all '5's in the input grid.
- Move these '5's closer to the center of the grid.
- Keep all other numbers in their original positions.

3. The retained values in the output grid seem to be the maximum values in their respective rows, excluding the '5's.

Let's verify this rule with the examples:
- In Example 1, the maximum values in each row (excluding '5') are retained: 7, 9, 7, 3, 8, 6, 6, 3, 4, 7, 6.
- In Example 2, the maximum values in each row (excluding '5') are retained: 3, 9, 6, 9, 7, 9.
- In Example 3, the maximum values in each row (excluding '5') are retained: 7, 8, 6, 8, 6, 7.
- In Example 4, the maximum values in each row (excluding '5') are retained: 3, 6, 7, 6, 4, 7, 6.

Based on this analysis, the transformation rule is:
- Keep all '5's as they are.
- For each row, find the maximum value excluding '5's and retain it in the output grid. All other values are replaced with '0'.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has a '1' at [0,0], [3,8], and [9,4]. In the output, the '1' at [3,8] is extended to the right until it hits another non-zero value or the edge of the grid.
   - The '6' at [1,8] and [7,7] is extended to the right until it hits another non-zero value or the edge of the grid.
   - The '3' at [3,3] and [4,3] is extended to the right until it hits another non-zero value or the edge of the grid.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The '7' at [0,1] and [8,1] is extended to the right until it hits another non-zero value or the edge of the grid.
   - The '8' at [0,6], [5,1], [6,8], [7,3], and [9,9] is extended to the right until it hits another non-zero value or the edge of the grid.
   - The '3' at [2,5] and [3,5] is extended to the right until it hits another non-zero value or the edge of the grid.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The '1' at [1,4], [2,1], and [9,1] is extended to the right until it hits another non-zero value or the edge of the grid.
   - The '3' at [6,4] and [7,4] is extended to the right until it hits another non-zero value or the edge of the grid.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each non-zero value in the input grid, extend it to the right until it hits another non-zero value or the edge of the grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has a '6' at position (2, 7) and (2, 8). In the output, these '6's are replaced by '8's.
   - The '8's in the input at (8, 1) and (8, 2) are replaced by '0's in the output.
   - The '0's in the input at (8, 3) and (8, 4) are replaced by '8's in the output.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The '9's in the input at (1, 6) to (1, 9) are replaced by '3's in the output.
   - The '3's in the input at (5, 0) to (5, 2) are replaced by '0's in the output.
   - The '0's in the input at (5, 3) and (5, 4) are replaced by '3's in the output.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The '8's in the input at (8, 6) to (8, 8) are replaced by '2's in the output.
   - The '2's in the input at (0, 0) to (0, 1) are replaced by '0's in the output.
   - The '0's in the input at (0, 2) and (0, 3) are replaced by '2's in the output.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each color 'x' in the input, find the smallest color 'y' that is greater than 'x' and replace all 'x's with 'y's.
- If there is no color greater than 'x', replace 'x' with '0'.
- If there is a '0' in the input, replace it with the smallest color greater than '0' that is present in the grid.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. In Example 1, the input grid has a row with two non-zero values (4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4). In the output, this row is transformed to [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]. This suggests that if a row has two non-zero values at the start and end, all the zeros in between are filled with the value of the first non-zero element.

2. In Example 2, the input grid has two rows with two non-zero values at the start and end ([8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8] and [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]). In the output, these rows are transformed to [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], respectively. This confirms the rule observed in Example 1.

3. In Example 3, the input grid has no rows with two non-zero values at the start and end. Therefore, the output grid remains the same as the input grid.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule is:
- If a row has two non-zero values at the start and end, all the zeros in between are filled with the value of the first non-zero element.
- If a row does not have two non-zero values at the start and end, it remains unchanged.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples provided:

1. **Example 1**: The input has a few '3's scattered in the grid. The output shows '8's placed around these '3's in a specific pattern. Specifically, '8's are placed in the positions that are diagonally adjacent to the '3's. For example, the '3' at (3, 3) has '8's at (2, 4) and (4, 2).

2. **Example 2**: The input has a block of '3's. The output shows '8's placed around this block in a similar diagonal pattern. The '8's are placed diagonally adjacent to the block of '3's.

3. **Example 3**: The input has '3's that are not adjacent. The output shows '8's placed diagonally adjacent to each '3' individually.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- For each '3' in the input grid, place '8's in the positions that are diagonally adjacent to it. This means placing '8's at the positions (i-1, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i-1, j-1), and (i+1, j+1) relative to the position of the '3' at (i, j).

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a mix of 0s and 8s, with a few other numbers (3, 2) appearing in specific locations.
   - In the output, the 0s and 8s are replaced with 3s and 2s in certain patterns. The numbers 3 and 2 seem to be introduced in areas where there are clusters of 8s.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid has a mix of 0s, 8s, and a few other numbers (1, 4).
   - In the output, the numbers 1 and 4 are introduced in areas where there are clusters of 8s, similar to the pattern observed in Example 1.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- **Clusters of 8s are replaced with a sequence of numbers (3, 2) or (1, 4) depending on the specific pattern.**
- The numbers 3 and 2, or 1 and 4, are introduced in a way that they form a repeating pattern within the clusters of 8s.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- Identify clusters of 8s in the test case.
- Replace these clusters with the numbers 3, 2, 1, or 4 in a repeating pattern.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has a pattern of '1's forming a square shape surrounded by '8's.
   - The output shows that the '1's remain unchanged, but the '8's directly adjacent to the '1's are replaced with '6's.
   - The '6's appear in a pattern that surrounds the '1's, extending one cell outward in all directions.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input has two separate patterns of '1's forming square shapes surrounded by '8's.
   - The output again shows that the '1's remain unchanged, and the '8's directly adjacent to the '1's are replaced with '6's.
   - The '6's appear in a pattern that surrounds each '1' shape, extending one cell outward in all directions.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Any '8' that is directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a '1' is changed to a '6'.
- All other values remain unchanged.

Let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a pattern of 8s forming a border around a central area with 3s and 6s. The output grid is similar but with the 6s shifted to the right and downwards.
2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a pattern of 3s forming a border around a central area with 6s. The output grid is similar but with the 6s shifted to the right and downwards.
3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a pattern of 8s forming a border around a central area with 2s and 4s. The output grid is similar but with the 2s and 4s shifted to the right and downwards.

From these examples, it appears that the transformation rule involves shifting the non-border elements (the elements that are not part of the border formed by a specific number) to the right and downwards. The border elements remain in their original positions.

Let's apply this rule to the test case:

- Identify the border elements: In this case, the border is formed by the 4s.
- Shift the non-border elements (all other numbers) to the right and downwards.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid has a central column of '3's and a rightmost column of '8's.
   - The output grid retains the '3's in the central column and the '8's in the rightmost column.
   - All other values are replaced with '0's except for the '2's which are retained in their original positions.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid has a central column of '4's and a rightmost column of '1's.
   - The output grid retains the '4's in the central column and the '1's in the rightmost column.
   - All other values are replaced with '0's except for the '8's which are retained in their original positions.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input grid has a central column of '3's and a rightmost column of '4's.
   - The output grid retains the '3's in the central column and the '4's in the rightmost column.
   - All other values are replaced with '0's except for the '2's and '8's which are retained in their original positions.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Retain the values in the central column (column with the most frequent non-zero value in the middle of the grid).
- Retain the values in the rightmost column.
- Retain any '2's and '8's in their original positions.
- Replace all other values with '0's.

- Retain the '2's and '8's in their original positions.
- Retain the '1's in the rightmost column.
- Replace all other values with '0's.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a cluster of '1's and a '5'. The output grid is a smaller 3x3 grid that captures the central part of the '1' cluster. The '5' is not included in the output, suggesting that only the largest cluster is considered.

2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a cluster of '4's. The output grid is a 3x3 grid that captures the central part of the '4' cluster. This confirms that the transformation focuses on the largest cluster.

3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a cluster of '2's. The output grid is a 3x3 grid that captures the central part of the '2' cluster. This further confirms the focus on the largest cluster.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
- Identify the largest cluster of non-zero values in the input grid.
- Extract a 3x3 subgrid centered on the largest cluster.
- If the largest cluster is smaller than 3x3, the output grid will be the largest possible subgrid centered on the cluster.

Applying this rule to the test case:
- The largest cluster in the test case is the '3's.
- The '3's form a larger cluster that can be centered in a 3x3 subgrid.
- The central 3x3 subgrid of the '3' cluster is:

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input has a block of 3s in the middle. In the output, the block remains the same, but additional 3s appear diagonally downward to the right from the bottom-right corner of the block. This suggests that the transformation rule involves extending the color diagonally downward to the right.

2. **Example 2**: The input has a block of 4s in the middle. The output shows the same block, with additional 4s extending diagonally downward to the right from the bottom-right corner of the block. This confirms the pattern observed in Example 1.

3. **Example 3**: The input has a block of 7s in the middle. The output shows the same block, with additional 7s extending diagonally downward to the right from the bottom-right corner of the block. This further confirms the pattern.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- For each block of a specific color, the block remains unchanged.
- Additional squares of the same color are added diagonally downward to the right from the bottom-right corner of the block.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids in the training examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: The grid has a pattern of 8s and 4s.
   - Output: The 8s have shifted positions, but the 4s remain unchanged.
   - Observation: The 8s seem to move in a way that they fill the gaps around them, but only within a certain boundary.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Similar pattern with 8s and 4s.
   - Output: The 8s again shift to fill gaps, but the 4s remain in their original positions.
   - Observation: The 8s fill the gaps around them, but they do not cross the boundary of the original 8s.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: A simpler pattern with 8s and 4s.
   - Output: The 8s fill the gaps around them, but the 4s remain unchanged.
   - Observation: The 8s fill the gaps around them, but they do not cross the boundary of the original 8s.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
- The 8s fill the gaps around them, but they do not cross the boundary of the original 8s.
- The 4s remain unchanged.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

1. **Observation of Example 1**:
   - The input grid has a pattern of 1s and 0s.
   - In the output, some 0s within the 1s are replaced with 2s, and some 1s are replaced with 7s.
   - The 2s appear in areas where there are 0s surrounded by 1s.
   - The 7s appear in areas where there are 1s surrounded by 0s.

2. **Observation of Example 2**:
   - Similar to Example 1, 0s surrounded by 1s are replaced with 2s.
   - 1s surrounded by 0s are replaced with 7s.

3. **Observation of Example 3**:
   - The pattern continues with 0s surrounded by 1s becoming 2s and 1s surrounded by 0s becoming 7s.

4. **Observation of Example 4 and 5**:
   - The same rule applies: 0s surrounded by 1s become 2s, and 1s surrounded by 0s become 7s.

From these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
- If a 0 is surrounded by 1s on all four sides (top, bottom, left, right), it is replaced with 2.
- If a 1 is surrounded by 0s on all four sides, it is replaced with 7.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.
