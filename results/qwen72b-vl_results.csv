To deduce the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: The input grid is 8x8, and the output grid is 4x4. The output grid seems to be a condensed version of the input grid. Observing the patterns, it appears that the output grid is formed by taking the maximum value from each 2x2 block of the input grid.
2. **Example 2**: Similarly, the output grid is formed by taking the maximum value from each 2x2 block of the input grid.
3. **Example 3**: The same pattern is observed, where the output grid is formed by taking the maximum value from each 2x2 block of the input grid.
4. **Example 4**: The pattern continues, with the output grid formed by taking the maximum value from each 2x2 block of the input grid.
5. **Example 5**: The pattern is consistent, with the output grid formed by taking the maximum value from each 2x2 block of the input grid.

From these observations, the transformation rule is: **The output grid is formed by taking the maximum value from each 2x2 block of the input grid.**

Now, let's apply this rule to the test case.

Test Case Input:
```
[
[0, 4, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5],
[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
[6, 0, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0],
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9],
[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]]
```

Applying the transformation rule:

1. First 2x2 block: `[[0, 4], [0, 4]]` -> max value is `4`
2. Second 2x2 block: `[[0, 4], [4, 4]]` -> max value is `4`
3. Third 2x2 block: `[[5, 0], [5, 0]]` -> max value is `5`
4. Fourth 2x2 block: `[[0, 0], [5, 5]]` -> max value is `5`
5. Fifth 2x2 block: `[[4, 4], [0, 0]]` -> max value is `4`
6. Sixth 2x2 block: `[[4, 0], [0, 0]]` -> max value is `4`
7. Seventh 2x2 block: `[[0, 5], [5, 0]]` -> max value is `5`
8. Eighth 2x2 block: `[[5, 5], [0, 0]]` -> max value is `5`
9. Ninth 2x2 block: `[[6, 0], [0, 0]]` -> max value is `6`
10. Tenth 2x2 block: `[[6, 6], [0, 6]]` -> max value is `6`
11. Eleventh 2x2 block: `[[9, 9], [0, 9]]` -> max value is `9`
12. Twelfth 2x2 block: `[[9, 0], [0, 0]]` -> max value is `9`
13. Thirteenth 2x2 block: `[[0, 6], [6, 0]]` -> max value is `6`
14. Fourteenth 2x2 block: `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]` -> max value is `0`
15. Fifteenth 2x2 block: `[[9, 0], [0, 9]]` -> max value is `9`
16. Sixteenth 2x2 block: `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]` -> max value is `0`

Output grid:
```
[
[4, 4, 5, 5],
[4, 4, 5, 5],
[6, 6, 9, 9],
[6, 0, 9, 0]]
```

Answer: ``` 
[
[4, 4, 5, 5],
[4, 4, 5, 5],
[6, 6, 9, 9],
[6, 0, 9, 0]]
